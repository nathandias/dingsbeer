BrewDog,Bashah,,,American Black Ale,8.6%,bottle,3.08,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,4/10/11,"12 oz bottle.
Batch 352 which I think says 12/19/10 as the bottled on date, but I bought this way before that so that cannot be correct. My suspicion is that is a best before date. Anyway...
Black pour with some brownish highlights. Not much head, very little lace, but it settles to give a spotty, creamy film on the surface.
Nose offers plenty of hop character, and it is typically aggressive for the style and the two breweries involved. 
That carries forward to the taste where the hops could be described as medicinal. It's not so much a question of bitterness, but there is a distinct flavor of herbal charcoal note.
There is a creamy element to the beer which suggests a hoppy stout rather than something lighter.
Not bad, but not a beer or style that I ever likely to fall in love with."
Mad River Brewing Company,Steelhead Extra Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),5.6%,bottle,2.08,2.5,2,2,2.5,2,4/9/11,"12 oz stubbie bottle. Blue label that is different to the picture in the BA db. As a single form Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour is a tad disappointing as the beer sits somewhat lifeless with a classic macro look - no head, no retention, no lace and a golden body. Color is fine, carbonation is not. Head is particularly disappointing to me.
Nose and tastes give a distinct vegetal sweetness and a malty experience that feels musty and old. No date on the bottle that I can see, so who knows? Finish lingers a little, but not really ina manner that one would want. Feels 'stale', but with no dating how are we supposed to know. Maybe this is a fresh bottle that always tastes like this!
This is quite a dry beer, but that doesn't save it from being a really lackluster effort. I'm not sure if it's the age of the beer or it's general lack of appeal, but it fails to satisfy on a number of levels.
Quite poor."
Capital Brewery,Supper Club Lager,,,American Pale Lager,5.0%,can,2.10,2,2,2,3,2,4/8/11,"12 oz metallic looking can. Thanks go out to Kevin for the chance to have a crack at this one.
Any wispy head that was there on the initial pour dies really quickly above a fizzy looking, golden colored body. Pretty poor looking.
No apparent nose, even on warming.
Tastes are the usual combo of vegetal sweetness, high carbonation and a malty blandness that is distinctive only in relation to its non-descript nature.
Not really much here that is too offensive, however it really only says macro swill, so...there you have it."
Steinhaus Brewing Co.,Mission St. Hefeweizen,,,Hefeweizen,4.7%,bottle,3.18,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,4/8/11,"22 oz bottle from the Trader Joe's cheap and cheerful line. I have had some really good success with some of these budget brews, but there have also been one or two stinkers so it's always an adventure - let's see what we have here.
The beer goes into the 500 mL Tucher Weizen glass. It's color is definitely out of the ordinary for the style. It's deep, orangey copper which is a long way away from a typical, lemony yellow body. The head is good initially, and to be fair doesn't fade as badly as many other cheaper beers, and even produces a little lace and retention. The color is striking if for no other reason than it's a little odd!
Tastes do replicate some very mild banana notes but the beer lacks a cutting edge. It feels a bit bloated and buttery and does not give a serious, sharp tang. 
The finish threatens more Hefe character, and to be honest it does deliver a little more, but at the end it feels a bit flabby for the style.
Having said that I was still happy purchase; didn't expect a lot, so wasn't disappointed."
Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,Ovila,,,Dubbel,?,bottle,3.93,3,3.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,4/8/11,"Corked & caged bottle with an unusual shape around the neck. Opens with a fearful pop with a button mushroom like cork - I suggest great care opening this one, but to be honest I would rather have it that way than without sufficient carbonation. Nice gun smoke.
Attractive reddish brown hue which seems less muddy than the usual Dubbel appearance which is a bonus. Having said that beer is a dreadfully disappointing head and it fades horribly. No lace, no retention - shame.
Light, alcoholic breadiness in the nose, but it's pretty muted.
The tastes are a very nice malty, lightly alcohol based fruitiness. I feels quite bready and has a little depth as well. A touch of caramelized raspberries in the back and the finish offers more of the alcohol soaked, marzipan based maltiness - very nice.
Tastes are the strong point here but the head retention is terribly poor."
De Scheldebrouwerij,Hop Ruiter,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,8.0%,bottle,3.70,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,4/7/11,"So I've been eying this 750 mL bottle in the store for some time and assumed (from afar) that it would be a Belgian IPA (considering the name), but was a little surprised to see it in the BA db as simply a BSPA. Additionally it was reviewed in this months BA magazine and was given the moniker 'Belgian Strong Golden Ale'! Seems like the beer has a identity crisis. Either way I'm pretty confident that I know what this beer will taste LIKE, it really depends to what degree that the white pepper, spice notes, alcohol, Belgian yeast/candy and hop character kick-in, before we can assign it its rightful place on that particular sliding scale.

Into the Duvel tulip she goes.

A pretty deep orange gold color on the body with some really lovely head, lace and retention. Beer looks bright and lively.

Nose gives up a little bitterness but not a great deal.

The tastes are a confusing mixture of things for me. what I would call a threatening hop base and a lurking Belgian yeast note but neither really come to the fore with any force. There is also an underlying sweetness that makes me almost think 'tripel' for a second, but then that is snatched away too. There are plenty of surprising floral notes too, which all adds up to a crazy package. I don't dislike it, but at the same time it never really delivers one thing or another. It's not a Belgian IPA, nor is it a really clean BSPA, and in that respect to be honest it disappoints a bit.

In addition I like the alcohol in a beer of this style to bite a little more than it does here. Needs a dash more pepper or solvent bite.

A beer that really doesn't know what it is. Like I say, not unpleasant, but a beer that falls between several stools for me and slightly lets me down. I wanted to like this more. Shame."
Cigar City Brewing,Capricho Oscuro - Batch 2,,,American Strong Ale,?,bottle,4.08,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,4/3/11,"12 oz bottle, many thanks go out to Steve for the chance to try this one.
On the neck label the Batch # (2), and the bottle count (205/450) are noted.
Pour is a dark, chestnut brown with quite a lot of sediment, a lovely rich, coffee colored head, some which brings with it some decent retention and lace.
Big 'ole which malty notes with some sherry and alcohol. 
Tastes reflect that, but come in with a bit more subtlety. The sherry and alcohol notes are reflected early, but then we get more chocolate character.
Body is a touch thinner than the style and the nose would suggest, but the shortcomings are not significant and still delivers a smooth feeling.
Interesting. A beer that seems to sit closer to a coffee-based, chocolaty porter or stout than an American Strong. Definitely low hop character for the style, and the mouthfeel doesn't match.
Interesting beer."
Ridgeway Brewing,Querkus Smoked Oaked Porter,,,English Porter,5.8%,bottle,3.93,4.5,4,4,3,4,4/3/11,"The presentation of this beer certainly makes one think that this could be a Scandinavian beer - something about the name and the label. Had no idea this was a Ridgeway beer until I looked at the label very carefully.
A really pretty color on the pour with plenty of ruby red highlights throughout the beer. Conservative head but still gives decent retention and some nice lace. However, the color is the star in the appearance; quite exquisite.
Nose and tastes give a mild smokiness that permeates the air above the beer. The beer is quite sweet and the malts dominate. There's no doubt that this is a unusual beer. At first this is not a surprise to me since an English Porter will certainly be less aggressive and more subtle than the American version of the style, but that's not where this ends. In reality this beer is really more like a smoked Dark Euro lager than even an English Porter, and it does not feel especially rich or creamy, but it is a very tasty and drinkable beer. The smoke is really subtle, sweet and light and it works really nicely.
Mouthfeel is definitely light.
A little unusual, so if you can accept that it is definitely NOT an American Porter (that shouldn't be hard), and also that it's not a very typical English Porter either (less easy to accept), and take it for what it is, you'll probably enjoy it."
Port Brewing Company / Pizza Port,Shark Attack Double Red Ale,,,American Amber / Red Ale,9.0%,bottle,2.75,2.5,3,2.5,3,3,4/2/11,"22 oz bottle, Arbor Place Beverage, Douglasville, GA, USA.
Very typical for the style, a cloudy and turbid brown soup like affair with some big, rocky, pitted, off-white head and lace. Retention is not great. It's a bit of an ugly looking beer for me.
Nose and tastes deliver typical big, hoppy alcohol notes, and there is the requisite dry finish. 
Strangely, the alcohol is fairly well hidden during the drink, but in the aftertaste and at the end the beer packs its' full punch. The combination of the dry character (good) and the somewhat overbearing alcohol (bad), make this a one and done beer for me.
Not a bad example, but it's too aggressive for me and I found it a bit muddled and lacking focus."
Russian River Brewing Company,Sanctification,,,American Wild Ale,6.5%,bottle,4.45,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,4/2/11,"375 mL bottle courtesy of Ross - many thanks. Batch 005.
Chilled this off perfectly and the medium pop on opening the corked & caged bottle produces some nice gun smoke. 
The head 'fizzes' up initially but of course it does not last and there is not much lace or retention. A very thin film of bubbles sit atop the beer.
The color is REALLY memorable. A very, very distinct lemon colored, yellow body. Super bright in terms of the hue and a stand out feature of the brew.
The nose is fresh and bright if somewhat predictable. Some apple notes and a little tart alcohol.
Tastes strike all of the right notes. Light, tart cider, citrus brightness and Brett fusion. Sharp and tart without lingering, the beer is clean. I really light the carbonation that seems perfect. It dances on the tongue and titillates but never gets prickly like beers of this type, can. As the beer warms I get a little more sweet character with some fruit coming through. Citrus. Green apples and gooseberries.
Overall a lovely, tasty beer which simply summarizes what RR does magnificently well."
Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company,Leinenkugel's Original,,,American Adjunct Lager,4.6%,can,3.15,3,3,3,3.5,3.5,3/31/11,"12 oz can, many thanks to Kevin for the chance to try this American classic.
Pour gives lots of typical, American Adjunct Lager classic traits, but the body is a quite strange glassy affair with alarming clarity. As is son often the case the beer produces an initially very good head, but it fades very quickly and leaves no lace. Poor retention.
Nose is slightly vegetal but with no really offensive notes.
Tastes are much the same as the nose in terms of their neutrality and non-offensiveness but the lend a little more sweetness than the nose would have initially suggested. Bright carbonation leads to a refreshing, breaking crispness across the palate.
The beer feels clean to me which s definitely in its favor and a malty sweetness than I don't mind, but truth be told like so many other there really is no distinguishable or quantifiable 'taste' present other than the usual."
Cigar City Brewing,Jai Alai IPA - Papaya,,,American IPA,7.5%,bottle,3.83,5,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,3/26/11,"750 mL bottle as part of a care package from Joey at the brewery. Many thanks.
Nothing on the label to suggest that this beer has Jai Alai as the base, but reading the reviews it apparently does.
The label is attractive and it suggests a fruity, rich experience is in store - that doesn't really happen for me.
Pour is a VERY attractive deep copper color with a high, fluffy head. The color is very rich and reminds me of one of those high def photographs that has that orange hue. The beer looks rich.
The aroma is also VERY strong. As soon as the cap is popped the beer starts to exude that pine notes associated with Jai Alai.
Unfortunately there is a fairly strong solvent alcohol taste that comes with the beer which to be honest, overwhelms any fruit character for me. I get VERY little fruit here at all, and it feels largely like a pretty standard, aggressive American IPA. Lots of bitter metallic notes which is OK, but it still leaves me craving a tropical fruit splash.
This is one pretty beer, and it's OK, but I would have LOVED a whole bunch of luscious fruit to come through in the taste; it just doesn't so in that respect a bit of a miss. Perhaps the label misled me a bit, and I felt slightly disappointed."
Jailhouse Brewing Company,Midnight Special India-Style Black Ale,,,American Black Ale,10.0%,bottle,4.45,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,3/26/11,"So, I had heard about the new limited, special series that Glenn at Jailhouse was going to release and this one popped up at Green's on Buford yesterday. $8.99 for the large (bomber like) bottle.
Part of the new, Solitary Confinement Series; Cool! Not sure that I understand the label with the train bearing down on the convict in his bed, but, hey...whatever!
The pour is a very rich looking, dense, totally black affair that pours with a real, 'gloop, gloop' noise as it comes out of the bottle. Heady is creamy.
The nose gives some light hops and is restrained, and balanced.
Tastes? OK, let's cut directly to the chase here - for ALL intents and purposes this is mildly hoppy, very creamy stout. It's VERY tasty, but if you come here looking for a typical (in so much as one can achieve for the newish style) Black India Ale then you may get a jolt.
Mild hops are the key with a REALLY creamy feel. Malt sweetness is VERY well represented too, and as is the case with ALL Jailhouse beers, this brew is finely balanced and not aggressive. A very large amount of dry chocolate character for me too, but it's not a dry cocoa or bakers chocolate - rather its a much richer, more milk chocolate like taste on my palate. The hops are present but at the same time they are definitely a backseat presence. They manifest themselves more in the finish and aftertaste rather than up front but even then they are countered with plenty of sweetness. The creamy feel is maintained throughout the beer for me.
Look, I have to be honest here. When I heard about the Jailhouse special series I was VERY excited. Then, when I saw the first one had ""India-Style Black Ale"" on the label I was really disappointed (NOT my favorite style, and I was worried about bandwagon jumping). However, when I cracked the bottle and drank the beer, I found that this was essentially a lightly hopped, really creamy, well-balanced stout so I had no need to worry.
Good grief, Glenn is making some superb beer, and if you ignore the style designation, this is another. Wow!"
North Peak Brewing Company,North Peak Siren Amber,,,American Amber / Red Ale,5.0%,bottle,3.23,3.5,3,3,4,3.5,3/26/11,"12 oz stubbie bottle as depicted in the BA db, thanks go out to Kevin for the chance to try this one.
Pour produces some nice sticky, white lace on top of a slightly murky, brown body. Not really very interesting to look at but at the same time the head is decent, produces some nice lace and is somewhat well retained.
Nose offers little other than some sweet malts.
The tastes are fairly ordinary with a few hoppy hints amongst the fairly dry, average malt base. Drinks easily and has good carbonation for the style. 
No groundbreaking moments here, just a solid, domestic version of a style that lacks much definition or character. Probably best sourced close to its home, very fresh and perhaps even on-tap."
21st Amendment Brewery,Bitter American,,,American Pale Ale (APA),4.4%,can,3.58,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,3/25/11,"OK, let's be clear, at 4.4% this is NOT a session beer. Right, now we've got that out of the way, back to the beer itself.
12 oz can, many thanks go out to Beejay for the chance to try this one.
Pour is a deep gold color with a pretty spectacular head (if somewhat light), but the lace is very good. Nice retention.
The carbonation seems a touch on the high side.
VERY strong hoppy aroma which is frankly a bit surprising. 
The hops threaten a bit at the start of the beer but never really amount to the threat of the burst that came in the nose when the ring-pull was first broken. There's a light, floral touch about the beer but the carbonation is not in check enough to make the beer really reach its potential. Prickly feel is a bit annoying to me and take away from the overall experience.
Pretty tasty, but I'd enjoy a little more malt presence to back up the green hops, and of course the use of the word 'session' on the can is simply factually inaccurate, but it's still a tasty beer."
Cigar City Brewing,El Lector,,,English Dark Mild Ale,4.0%,growler,3.63,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3/25/11,"32 oz growler courtesy of Joey as part of a care package from the brewery.
Beer pours a very cloudy, chocolate brown color with a very, very modest head. Lace is minimal. In stronger light the beer takes on more orange hues. Does look especially attractive, but having said that a great Mild is seldom a stunning looker, so there is a degree of authenticity about that!

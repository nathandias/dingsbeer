BrewDog,Bashah,,,American Black Ale,8.6%,bottle,3.08,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,4/10/11,"12 oz bottle.
Batch 352 which I think says 12/19/10 as the bottled on date, but I bought this way before that so that cannot be correct. My suspicion is that is a best before date. Anyway...
Black pour with some brownish highlights. Not much head, very little lace, but it settles to give a spotty, creamy film on the surface.
Nose offers plenty of hop character, and it is typically aggressive for the style and the two breweries involved. 
That carries forward to the taste where the hops could be described as medicinal. It's not so much a question of bitterness, but there is a distinct flavor of herbal charcoal note.
There is a creamy element to the beer which suggests a hoppy stout rather than something lighter.
Not bad, but not a beer or style that I ever likely to fall in love with."
Mad River Brewing Company,Steelhead Extra Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),5.6%,bottle,2.08,2.5,2,2,2.5,2,4/9/11,"12 oz stubbie bottle. Blue label that is different to the picture in the BA db. As a single form Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour is a tad disappointing as the beer sits somewhat lifeless with a classic macro look - no head, no retention, no lace and a golden body. Color is fine, carbonation is not. Head is particularly disappointing to me.
Nose and tastes give a distinct vegetal sweetness and a malty experience that feels musty and old. No date on the bottle that I can see, so who knows? Finish lingers a little, but not really ina manner that one would want. Feels 'stale', but with no dating how are we supposed to know. Maybe this is a fresh bottle that always tastes like this!
This is quite a dry beer, but that doesn't save it from being a really lackluster effort. I'm not sure if it's the age of the beer or it's general lack of appeal, but it fails to satisfy on a number of levels.
Quite poor."
Capital Brewery,Supper Club Lager,,,American Pale Lager,5.0%,can,2.10,2,2,2,3,2,4/8/11,"12 oz metallic looking can. Thanks go out to Kevin for the chance to have a crack at this one.
Any wispy head that was there on the initial pour dies really quickly above a fizzy looking, golden colored body. Pretty poor looking.
No apparent nose, even on warming.
Tastes are the usual combo of vegetal sweetness, high carbonation and a malty blandness that is distinctive only in relation to its non-descript nature.
Not really much here that is too offensive, however it really only says macro swill, so...there you have it."
Steinhaus Brewing Co.,Mission St. Hefeweizen,,,Hefeweizen,4.7%,bottle,3.18,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,4/8/11,"22 oz bottle from the Trader Joe's cheap and cheerful line. I have had some really good success with some of these budget brews, but there have also been one or two stinkers so it's always an adventure - let's see what we have here.
The beer goes into the 500 mL Tucher Weizen glass. It's color is definitely out of the ordinary for the style. It's deep, orangey copper which is a long way away from a typical, lemony yellow body. The head is good initially, and to be fair doesn't fade as badly as many other cheaper beers, and even produces a little lace and retention. The color is striking if for no other reason than it's a little odd!
Tastes do replicate some very mild banana notes but the beer lacks a cutting edge. It feels a bit bloated and buttery and does not give a serious, sharp tang. 
The finish threatens more Hefe character, and to be honest it does deliver a little more, but at the end it feels a bit flabby for the style.
Having said that I was still happy purchase; didn't expect a lot, so wasn't disappointed."
Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,Ovila,,,Dubbel,?,bottle,3.93,3,3.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,4/8/11,"Corked & caged bottle with an unusual shape around the neck. Opens with a fearful pop with a button mushroom like cork - I suggest great care opening this one, but to be honest I would rather have it that way than without sufficient carbonation. Nice gun smoke.
Attractive reddish brown hue which seems less muddy than the usual Dubbel appearance which is a bonus. Having said that beer is a dreadfully disappointing head and it fades horribly. No lace, no retention - shame.
Light, alcoholic breadiness in the nose, but it's pretty muted.
The tastes are a very nice malty, lightly alcohol based fruitiness. I feels quite bready and has a little depth as well. A touch of caramelized raspberries in the back and the finish offers more of the alcohol soaked, marzipan based maltiness - very nice.
Tastes are the strong point here but the head retention is terribly poor."
De Scheldebrouwerij,Hop Ruiter,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,8.0%,bottle,3.70,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,4/7/11,"So I've been eying this 750 mL bottle in the store for some time and assumed (from afar) that it would be a Belgian IPA (considering the name), but was a little surprised to see it in the BA db as simply a BSPA. Additionally it was reviewed in this months BA magazine and was given the moniker 'Belgian Strong Golden Ale'! Seems like the beer has a identity crisis. Either way I'm pretty confident that I know what this beer will taste LIKE, it really depends to what degree that the white pepper, spice notes, alcohol, Belgian yeast/candy and hop character kick-in, before we can assign it its rightful place on that particular sliding scale.

Into the Duvel tulip she goes.

A pretty deep orange gold color on the body with some really lovely head, lace and retention. Beer looks bright and lively.

Nose gives up a little bitterness but not a great deal.

The tastes are a confusing mixture of things for me. what I would call a threatening hop base and a lurking Belgian yeast note but neither really come to the fore with any force. There is also an underlying sweetness that makes me almost think 'tripel' for a second, but then that is snatched away too. There are plenty of surprising floral notes too, which all adds up to a crazy package. I don't dislike it, but at the same time it never really delivers one thing or another. It's not a Belgian IPA, nor is it a really clean BSPA, and in that respect to be honest it disappoints a bit.

In addition I like the alcohol in a beer of this style to bite a little more than it does here. Needs a dash more pepper or solvent bite.

A beer that really doesn't know what it is. Like I say, not unpleasant, but a beer that falls between several stools for me and slightly lets me down. I wanted to like this more. Shame."
Cigar City Brewing,Capricho Oscuro - Batch 2,,,American Strong Ale,?,bottle,4.08,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,4/3/11,"12 oz bottle, many thanks go out to Steve for the chance to try this one.
On the neck label the Batch # (2), and the bottle count (205/450) are noted.
Pour is a dark, chestnut brown with quite a lot of sediment, a lovely rich, coffee colored head, some which brings with it some decent retention and lace.
Big 'ole which malty notes with some sherry and alcohol. 
Tastes reflect that, but come in with a bit more subtlety. The sherry and alcohol notes are reflected early, but then we get more chocolate character.
Body is a touch thinner than the style and the nose would suggest, but the shortcomings are not significant and still delivers a smooth feeling.
Interesting. A beer that seems to sit closer to a coffee-based, chocolaty porter or stout than an American Strong. Definitely low hop character for the style, and the mouthfeel doesn't match.
Interesting beer."
Ridgeway Brewing,Querkus Smoked Oaked Porter,,,English Porter,5.8%,bottle,3.93,4.5,4,4,3,4,4/3/11,"The presentation of this beer certainly makes one think that this could be a Scandinavian beer - something about the name and the label. Had no idea this was a Ridgeway beer until I looked at the label very carefully.
A really pretty color on the pour with plenty of ruby red highlights throughout the beer. Conservative head but still gives decent retention and some nice lace. However, the color is the star in the appearance; quite exquisite.
Nose and tastes give a mild smokiness that permeates the air above the beer. The beer is quite sweet and the malts dominate. There's no doubt that this is a unusual beer. At first this is not a surprise to me since an English Porter will certainly be less aggressive and more subtle than the American version of the style, but that's not where this ends. In reality this beer is really more like a smoked Dark Euro lager than even an English Porter, and it does not feel especially rich or creamy, but it is a very tasty and drinkable beer. The smoke is really subtle, sweet and light and it works really nicely.
Mouthfeel is definitely light.
A little unusual, so if you can accept that it is definitely NOT an American Porter (that shouldn't be hard), and also that it's not a very typical English Porter either (less easy to accept), and take it for what it is, you'll probably enjoy it."
Port Brewing Company / Pizza Port,Shark Attack Double Red Ale,,,American Amber / Red Ale,9.0%,bottle,2.75,2.5,3,2.5,3,3,4/2/11,"22 oz bottle, Arbor Place Beverage, Douglasville, GA, USA.
Very typical for the style, a cloudy and turbid brown soup like affair with some big, rocky, pitted, off-white head and lace. Retention is not great. It's a bit of an ugly looking beer for me.
Nose and tastes deliver typical big, hoppy alcohol notes, and there is the requisite dry finish. 
Strangely, the alcohol is fairly well hidden during the drink, but in the aftertaste and at the end the beer packs its' full punch. The combination of the dry character (good) and the somewhat overbearing alcohol (bad), make this a one and done beer for me.
Not a bad example, but it's too aggressive for me and I found it a bit muddled and lacking focus."
Russian River Brewing Company,Sanctification,,,American Wild Ale,6.5%,bottle,4.45,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,4/2/11,"375 mL bottle courtesy of Ross - many thanks. Batch 005.
Chilled this off perfectly and the medium pop on opening the corked & caged bottle produces some nice gun smoke. 
The head 'fizzes' up initially but of course it does not last and there is not much lace or retention. A very thin film of bubbles sit atop the beer.
The color is REALLY memorable. A very, very distinct lemon colored, yellow body. Super bright in terms of the hue and a stand out feature of the brew.
The nose is fresh and bright if somewhat predictable. Some apple notes and a little tart alcohol.
Tastes strike all of the right notes. Light, tart cider, citrus brightness and Brett fusion. Sharp and tart without lingering, the beer is clean. I really light the carbonation that seems perfect. It dances on the tongue and titillates but never gets prickly like beers of this type, can. As the beer warms I get a little more sweet character with some fruit coming through. Citrus. Green apples and gooseberries.
Overall a lovely, tasty beer which simply summarizes what RR does magnificently well."
Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company,Leinenkugel's Original,,,American Adjunct Lager,4.6%,can,3.15,3,3,3,3.5,3.5,3/31/11,"12 oz can, many thanks to Kevin for the chance to try this American classic.
Pour gives lots of typical, American Adjunct Lager classic traits, but the body is a quite strange glassy affair with alarming clarity. As is son often the case the beer produces an initially very good head, but it fades very quickly and leaves no lace. Poor retention.
Nose is slightly vegetal but with no really offensive notes.
Tastes are much the same as the nose in terms of their neutrality and non-offensiveness but the lend a little more sweetness than the nose would have initially suggested. Bright carbonation leads to a refreshing, breaking crispness across the palate.
The beer feels clean to me which s definitely in its favor and a malty sweetness than I don't mind, but truth be told like so many other there really is no distinguishable or quantifiable 'taste' present other than the usual."
Cigar City Brewing,Jai Alai IPA - Papaya,,,American IPA,7.5%,bottle,3.83,5,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,3/26/11,"750 mL bottle as part of a care package from Joey at the brewery. Many thanks.
Nothing on the label to suggest that this beer has Jai Alai as the base, but reading the reviews it apparently does.
The label is attractive and it suggests a fruity, rich experience is in store - that doesn't really happen for me.
Pour is a VERY attractive deep copper color with a high, fluffy head. The color is very rich and reminds me of one of those high def photographs that has that orange hue. The beer looks rich.
The aroma is also VERY strong. As soon as the cap is popped the beer starts to exude that pine notes associated with Jai Alai.
Unfortunately there is a fairly strong solvent alcohol taste that comes with the beer which to be honest, overwhelms any fruit character for me. I get VERY little fruit here at all, and it feels largely like a pretty standard, aggressive American IPA. Lots of bitter metallic notes which is OK, but it still leaves me craving a tropical fruit splash.
This is one pretty beer, and it's OK, but I would have LOVED a whole bunch of luscious fruit to come through in the taste; it just doesn't so in that respect a bit of a miss. Perhaps the label misled me a bit, and I felt slightly disappointed."
Jailhouse Brewing Company,Midnight Special India-Style Black Ale,,,American Black Ale,10.0%,bottle,4.45,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,3/26/11,"So, I had heard about the new limited, special series that Glenn at Jailhouse was going to release and this one popped up at Green's on Buford yesterday. $8.99 for the large (bomber like) bottle.
Part of the new, Solitary Confinement Series; Cool! Not sure that I understand the label with the train bearing down on the convict in his bed, but, hey...whatever!
The pour is a very rich looking, dense, totally black affair that pours with a real, 'gloop, gloop' noise as it comes out of the bottle. Heady is creamy.
The nose gives some light hops and is restrained, and balanced.
Tastes? OK, let's cut directly to the chase here - for ALL intents and purposes this is mildly hoppy, very creamy stout. It's VERY tasty, but if you come here looking for a typical (in so much as one can achieve for the newish style) Black India Ale then you may get a jolt.
Mild hops are the key with a REALLY creamy feel. Malt sweetness is VERY well represented too, and as is the case with ALL Jailhouse beers, this brew is finely balanced and not aggressive. A very large amount of dry chocolate character for me too, but it's not a dry cocoa or bakers chocolate - rather its a much richer, more milk chocolate like taste on my palate. The hops are present but at the same time they are definitely a backseat presence. They manifest themselves more in the finish and aftertaste rather than up front but even then they are countered with plenty of sweetness. The creamy feel is maintained throughout the beer for me.
Look, I have to be honest here. When I heard about the Jailhouse special series I was VERY excited. Then, when I saw the first one had ""India-Style Black Ale"" on the label I was really disappointed (NOT my favorite style, and I was worried about bandwagon jumping). However, when I cracked the bottle and drank the beer, I found that this was essentially a lightly hopped, really creamy, well-balanced stout so I had no need to worry.
Good grief, Glenn is making some superb beer, and if you ignore the style designation, this is another. Wow!"
North Peak Brewing Company,North Peak Siren Amber,,,American Amber / Red Ale,5.0%,bottle,3.23,3.5,3,3,4,3.5,3/26/11,"12 oz stubbie bottle as depicted in the BA db, thanks go out to Kevin for the chance to try this one.
Pour produces some nice sticky, white lace on top of a slightly murky, brown body. Not really very interesting to look at but at the same time the head is decent, produces some nice lace and is somewhat well retained.
Nose offers little other than some sweet malts.
The tastes are fairly ordinary with a few hoppy hints amongst the fairly dry, average malt base. Drinks easily and has good carbonation for the style. 
No groundbreaking moments here, just a solid, domestic version of a style that lacks much definition or character. Probably best sourced close to its home, very fresh and perhaps even on-tap."
21st Amendment Brewery,Bitter American,,,American Pale Ale (APA),4.4%,can,3.58,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,3/25/11,"OK, let's be clear, at 4.4% this is NOT a session beer. Right, now we've got that out of the way, back to the beer itself.
12 oz can, many thanks go out to Beejay for the chance to try this one.
Pour is a deep gold color with a pretty spectacular head (if somewhat light), but the lace is very good. Nice retention.
The carbonation seems a touch on the high side.
VERY strong hoppy aroma which is frankly a bit surprising. 
The hops threaten a bit at the start of the beer but never really amount to the threat of the burst that came in the nose when the ring-pull was first broken. There's a light, floral touch about the beer but the carbonation is not in check enough to make the beer really reach its potential. Prickly feel is a bit annoying to me and take away from the overall experience.
Pretty tasty, but I'd enjoy a little more malt presence to back up the green hops, and of course the use of the word 'session' on the can is simply factually inaccurate, but it's still a tasty beer."
Cigar City Brewing,El Lector,,,English Dark Mild Ale,4.0%,growler,3.63,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3/25/11,"32 oz growler courtesy of Joey as part of a care package from the brewery.
Beer pours a very cloudy, chocolate brown color with a very, very modest head. Lace is minimal. In stronger light the beer takes on more orange hues. Does look especially attractive, but having said that a great Mild is seldom a stunning looker, so there is a degree of authenticity about that!
Nose is a very nutty affair - noticeably so in fact. Surprising. If this were a blind taste taste I would guess that this was a brown ale with nut character of some description. As the beer warms, the nutty character seems to morph into a yeast and nut combo.
The beer does not replicate the nutty character of the nose which frankly is a good thing, but is does leave a little residual in the back end.
The beer is simply balanced with a pleasing drinkability that goes down easily, but it seems a long way removed from an English Dark Mild to me. No sweat, I'm just delighted to get the chance to drink a well balanced, tasty beer that comes in at session strength - it is LITERALLY difficult to be able to do that these days in the US. For this, I am grateful, cheers CCB."
Fuller Smith & Turner PLC,Organic Honeydew,,,English Pale Ale,5.0%,bottle,4.03,4.5,4,4,4,4,3/25/11,"500 mL bottle as depicted in the BA database. $3.99 from Green's on Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour is an impressive, bright golden color with some lovely clarity, good carbonation, a nice, tight white head with some good retention and lace. Attractive no doubt with some great depth of orange color in the golden hue. Nice.
The nose offers a little breadiness amongst the sweet malts and a a hint of toasty grains.
Tastes give more of the toasty grain character and a honey elements that is more on the clover and fragrant side of things rather than intensely sweet. A beer that is warm in character and gives subtle hints and notes that will escape many. The bread element never leaves, and this beer is one that is probably best suited to cooler months. Surprisingly hearty, filling and satisfying for a beer with a light touch.
Drinkable? Certainly, but I'd need to be in the mood for this. If I were, this is a beer that I could drink a lot of despite its non-session beer ABV."
21st Amendment Brewery,Monk's Blood,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,8.3%,can,3.05,3,3,3,3.5,3,3/24/11,"12 oz single can from Mac's, Midtown, Atlanta, GA, USA as part of their new ""Pick/Mix a Four pack"" as opposed to the pick/mix a 6 pack.
The beer pours a hazed, reddish-copper color with some cream colored head that does not linger. Not much lace.
Nose gives up a little maltiness but to be honest it really is nothing to crow about. Some sweetness and a dash of alcohol but not much else, even on warming.
Tastes are pretty sweet which is OK for the style, but follows up with some significant bubble-gum that is a little grating. There is quite a lot of ester character with pineapple definitely in there, but the beer never really delivers that specific, Belgian yeast elements that I'm looking for. Alcohol is a touch solventy for me too.
I dunno I was expecting more I guess, as a beer I had heard a lot about and in one of my favorite style ought to excite me more than this did. I found it sweeter than it should be with not much subtlety or interest."
New Holland Brewing Company,New Holland Night Tripper,,,American Double / Imperial Stout,10.8%,bottle,3.53,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3/20/11,"22 oz bottle from Brawley's, Charlotte, NC, USA.
Light foil on the neck of the bottle.
New Holland is one of the few brewers that get to NC but not to GA, so I generally pick up something from them every time I'm up in NC.
Inky black pour with a modest head. Some nice, then mocha film sit atop the black body. Carbonation is reserved but entirely appropriate.
Nose and tastes give a fairly significant sweet effect. Some alcohol and lots of dry chocolate in the finish. A little warmth but considering the ABV the beer is pretty drinkable and the alcohol is largely hidden.
Actually the whole package seems surprisingly light to me, especially in terms of the mouthfeel. No slickness or difficult coating of the mouth.
The biitterness is not really that evident until the aftertaste when a combination of very light charcoal, smoke, dry bakers chocolate and a touch more alcohol come together.
Smooth, relatively well disguised alcohol and a beer that is typical of the American version of the style. No t my favorite, but a solid 'B' for me."
Sprecher Brewing Company,Irish Style Stout,,,Irish Dry Stout,5.7%,bottle,4.00,4,4,4,4,4,3/20/11,"12 oz stubbie bottle as per the usual Sprecher presentation. Thanks go out to Kevin for the chance to try this beer.
The bottom line with Sprecher is that they produce some great examples of simple styles, that are generally under-appreciated outside of their immediate locale, and by America geeks in general.
Simple black body with a modest head.
The thing I like about both the nose and taste associated with this beer is that they both represent a VERY light, balanced profile that sits in a drinkability range which is accessible. The ABV, although it could be much lower, also adds to the drinkability, ad the beer is one that one can really attack as a satisfying DRINK as opposed to SIPPING!
Very light malts and a gentle bakers chocolate touch on the beer. Light in the mouth with a pleasing kiss of bitterness in the back end. Finish is dry as expected, but again it's perfectly balanced and only represents a subtle brush with that characteristic.
Impressive, tasty, drinkable and overall just a really pleasing beer. Not the first time that I've said that about Sprecher."
Wychwood Brewery Company Ltd,King Goblin,,,Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB),6.6%,bottle,4.53,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,3/20/11,"Single 500 mL bottle from Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA , USA.
Superb color on the pour, giving a beautiful, garnet clarity that I seldom see these days. Color is deep and present. Head is to be frank, a little disappointing. Small, not well retained although the lace defies he lack of retention.
Nose and tastes give up a classic biscuit malt and a light touch which defines the style (at least in the bottle). Some hoppy notes are added to the alcohol which produce a nice balance of drying malts and satisfying digestive like tastes.
The beer fills a HUGE void in the USA for lovers of the style, and whilst we all know that the cask equivalent would blow this away, it still represents a solid offering that helps define a bottled version of the style.
Lovely weight, excellent balance and a beer that I will turn to time and time again (as long as I can get it).
Simplicity. Goodness. Balance. Class."
Minhas Craft Brewery,Huber Premium Beer,,,American Pale Lager,?,can,3.15,2.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,3,3/19/11,"12 oz can, many thanks go out to Kevin for the chance to try this.
Retro style can which is attractive - good times.
Slightly hazed with a macro colored pour, the beer appears similar to a macro adjunct with perhaps a notch above in terms of color and head. lace and retention are still huge issues though.
Nose and tastes deliver a macro adjunct experience as well, but it is less sweet and offensive than many in a similar group. Fairly neutral in the final analysis, but not really offensive or too sweet. Clean beer with a lack of linger aftertaste or unpleasantness.
Carbonation seems appropriate and the beer does what it is supposed to. 
No more, no less here with a slightly sweet but non-offensive package that would work in a few, outdoor, summer situations."
Minhas Craft Brewery,Mountain Creek Classic Lager,,,American Pale Lager,5.5%,can,1.90,2,2,2,2,1.5,3/19/11,"12 oz can thanks go out to Kevin for the chance to try this one.
The latest in a huge parade of Minhas mediocrity.
This time the pour gives a pretty serious initially head, but it collapses to give nothing in terms of lace or retention.
Body is a golden color with a disappointing lack of carbonation - weak to be honest.
Pretty offensive, sweet, grainy corn hits the nose and palate and never gives anything more than that. Vegetal notes and a more than average sweetness drives home the adjunct feel.
Not good, difficult to consume and typically Minhas. that adds up to a write-off for me. Blah. Belch. Meh."
Stone Brewing Co.,Stone Old Guardian BELGO Barleywine,,,American Barleywine,12.0%,bottle,4.03,4.5,4,4,4,4,3/18/11,"22 oz bottle from The Beer Dispensary, Apex, NC, USA.
I approach this beer with a mix of trepidation, excitement and interest since I feel that it is likely to bring together two elements of beer that are usually at opposite ends of the enjoyment spectrum for , namely Belgian yeast and character at one end (the good), and aggressive, hoppy, high ABV American Barleywines at the other (the bad) - it promises to be quite the experience.
The pour is a VERY attractive, bright dark copper with some lovely clarity and a surprisingly good head considering the ABV. Lace and retention are also above average, certainly a good looking beer.
The Belgian character is evident immediately and I'm glad of that! It does manage to sustain the yeast notes throughout as well. Ultimately it DOES deliver the more harsh, hoppy, high ABV notes that one would associate with the regular version of OG, and that's OK with me even if it's not my preference.
The sugary alcohol clashes a little with the more subtle, Belgian nuance (and it's even worse when the hops crash in), but since the American influence seems to cut in very late in the beer, it does seem to 'work'. The lateness of that appearance helps the beer overall but it does significantly shorten the enjoyment of the backend and aftertaste and finish of the beer. In the end though, not too much lost.
It's definitely a little bit 'mad', and certainly in the Stone mold of beers that push limits but this is one that does work for me - others have not.
All in all it's clean, delivers at both ends of the spectrum and manages to keep the disparate, fighting influences if not exactly in harmony, at least at arms length. In the final analysis I found it surprisingly good."
Port Brewing Company / Pizza Port,Mongo,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,8.5%,bottle,3.28,3.5,4,3,3.5,3,3/17/11,"22 oz bottle. $7.99 from Ansley Wine Merchants, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Heard a lot of buzz about this beer in the last couple of weeks as LA/Port has recently made it to GA. For some reason (not sure why) I was under the impression that this was going to be largely a draught offering, so I was a little surprised to find it in bottles.
Pour is an attractive hazy marmalade color with a large, three finger head but doesn't quite give the magnificent and sticky lace that such a good head should bring, and one that is often associated with the style. In that respect slightly disappointing in terms of the look.
The nose is big, green, resiny and has a 'whole-hop' type feel - quite aggressive.
The tastes (unsurprisingly) follow suit, but rather than bringing with them a tangerine or grapefruit fruitiness, the beer drives home even more bitter green pine. It lacks a sweet element for me, and that's no good in a DIPA for me.
All the elements are there for this to be a super west coast IPA, but the malt bill comes up WAY too short for me, and it's almost as if I needs a couple of spoonfuls of sugar mixed in to the beer or even a splash of sweetened grapefruit juice."
Olde Hickory Brewery,Imperial Stout,,,American Double / Imperial Stout,10.2%,bottle,4.08,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,3/16/11,"2011 vintage, as a gift from Mike at Duckworth's. Most generous, many thanks.
22 oz bottle with some really thick gold wax on top. Ding and the wax go to battle for a few minutes before I manage to prise the cap off. Wax seal like affair has 2011 embossed into the wax.
Pour is the requisite black, inky body, but with a very well retained head and some nice, cappuccino, sticky mocha colored lace.
The mouthfeel is pretty silky without being remotely cloying at all. Very smooth even considering the style. 
Tastes reflect the style well, but it's quite sweet and mild. It's not that the honey actually shines through as a taste or even as a harsh sweetness, but it certainly significantly takes the edge off things - really rich and non-bitter.
There is a hint of hoppy character WAY in the back of the back end, but it is really not significant.
Alcohol is INCREDIBLY well hidden.
Tasty, very smooth."
Erie Brewing Co.,Presque Isle Pilsner,,,German Pilsener,4.2%,bottle,2.33,2,2,2.5,3,2,3/13/11,"12 oz single thanks go out to Kevin for the chance to try this one.
Extremely pale color on the pour with a touch of haziness about it - not good for a Pils.
Carbonation seems low for the style too.
Weak vegetal notes, some dubious notes int eh nose and some funny dry bitterness in the finish.
Not a clean beer and it lacks all kinds of attributes that a solid Pils should have.
Perhaps better fresher and closer tot he source, but I'm not convinced of that and I'm not holding my breath."
Minhas Craft Brewery,Berghoff Rock River Red Ale,,,American Amber / Red Ale,?,bottle,1.85,1.5,2.5,1.5,3,1.5,3/13/11,"12 oz single thanks to Kevin for the chance to try this.
What is this??
Expecting an Amber/Red of *some* description I get a honey-colored, slightly hazy beer that, apart from the big, fluffy head, appears to be a macro color.
The nose and tastes are SUPER sweet and grainy. I mean SWEET, even by my standards that can usually tolerate a lot of sweetness. There's a corny maltiness about the beer too. Metallic features amongst the vegetal notes. Some alcohol.
Strange, and if this is an Amber/Red then I am a Dutchman. ZERO out of five for the style, and pretty undrinkable to boot as well. The head is decent, retained to some extent and overs some watery lace, but utside of that this is fairly odd and virtually undrinkable. Nasty."
Port Brewing Company / Pizza Port,Wipeout I.P.A.,,,American IPA,7.0%,bottle,3.50,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3/12/11,"Review #2600 on BA. On tap at Taco Mac, East West Connector, Austell, Atlanta, GA, USA. 16 oz pour.
The beer comes as a hazed, mid-orange pour with the emphasis on the cloudy nature of the beer. Quite 'dense' looking which is OK for the nice, two-finger head that forms, but less appealing in the body of the beer.
Typical, west coast, American IPA is the simple analysis here; large, piney, resinous grapefruit in the nose which intensifies on warming. More of the same in the tastes with perhaps a bit more sweet grapefruit than the nose would suggest. Simple aftertaste and a few hoppy burps - a good sign.
Alcohol quite well hidden.
Served too cold, this beer benefits from warming a bit and could do with a body that was less clouded. Apart from that it's a typical, solid, west coast example fo an IPA which is both good and bad - you get what they say you will get, but at the same time the beer could honestly be one of dozens and dozens of other beers - ultimately, OK, but largely forgettable and nondescript. I'm looking for something a bit 'cleaner' both in look and taste to give higher scores."
21st Amendment Brewery,Fireside Chat,,,Winter Warmer,7.9%,can,1.83,3,2.5,1.5,3,1,3/11/11,"$1.65 for the 12 oz can from Green's on Buford Highway, Atlanta, GA, USA.
A reddish, thin looking body with some brown highlights at the extremities.
The head is richer than the body and leaves some nice, dense lace.
The beer has very little hint of being a Winter Warmer and frankly no winter spice element that I can detect. It drinks like a thin, acidic, slightly off brown ale that may be on the brink of developing a large infection. Some slight lacto elements, the beer is pretty poor under any guise, and a tragic Winter Warmer.
Too light in the mouth and a nasty acidic aftertaste pull the shambolic 'beer' together.
It's bad - period."
Raccoon Lodge and Brewpub / Cascade Brewing,Cascade Kriek Ale,,,Flanders Red Ale,7.3%,bottle,3.13,3.5,3,3,4,3,3/11/11,"750 mL, corked & caged from Brawley's, Charlotte, NC. 2009 vintage, $19.99.
No hint of a pop on opening.
Pour gives some more head than I was expecting but no lace and only a thin film is left behind after a couple of minutes. The body is a light, chestnut brown color and lacks much hint of red that a few others seem to have mentioned.
Nose gives plenty of sinus clearing, fruity acidity - as expected.
Tastes reflect the nose but with a touch more aggression and more residual drying effects from the oak. I like the carbonation which seems to add some life to the beer. A bit higher than normal for the style, and it brings a touch of CO2 into the taste - I like that.
Pretty solid example although I think that there are beers that offer a lot more subtlety even within/considering the style. This lends a typical, in your face American approach which grates on me after a while. The acid is a bit all over the place, and crashes into me a little too much to suggest refinement.
Cherry elements are hardly present at all for me."
Big Boss Brewing,Angry Angel Kolsch,,,Kölsch,4.5%,bottle,2.38,1.5,3,2,3,2.5,3/10/11,"12 oz single from The Beer Dispensary, Apex, NC, USA.
Kolsch? Nope.
Pour gives a cloudy, mid orange body with a large, frothy, fluffy off-white head that leaves some sticky lace.
The nose instantly gives a fairly significant blast of hops, and the tastes replicate some of the hop bitterness too. Also present is a large malt backbone which holds the whole thing together. Aftertaste is quite dry.
In a blind taste taste I would put this down as being an old, American IPA. It fails the 'look' test for a Kolsch and has very little resemblance to the style no matter how one cuts it.
Mediocre beer, atrocious Kolsch. Germans will be revolting."
De Leyerth Brouwerijen (Urthel),Urthel Saisonnière,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,6.0%,bottle,4.23,4,4,4.5,4,4,3/10/11,"11.2 oz bottle.
Surprised to see this at The Beer Dispensary in Apex, NC, USA. Not an Urthel beer that I have ever seen in the US before.
Pour gives a pretty standard, honeyed, hazed, lemon color with a nice creamy white foam on top. Some nice lace as the beer sits in the Brasserie de l'Abbaye des Rocs goblet.
A significant, sweet earthiness permeates the nose of this beer right from the get go. Organic feel about the beer.
In typical Urthel fashion the tastes are a little reminiscent of a Belgian IPA with some significant bitterness and a little hoppy note in the finish. The hoppy bitterness breaks the white pepper bitterness open a touch, and *slightly* moves the beer to a different level from your typical Saison.
The aftertastes accentuates the soapy, hoppy bitter section but it never gets aggressive and always feels within, if somewhat prodding at the edges, of the style.
Tasty, and a touch off-beat for the style but for me it works well. Nice"
New Belgium Brewing,Le Terroir,,,American Wild Ale,7.5%,bottle,4.33,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,3/10/11,"22 oz bottle.
Pour is a rich, golden color with good clarity but a few hints of hazy cloud. Head forms quickly, is small, light and fluffy and fades to yield no more than a thin film and next to no lace.
Nose is interesting. As well as the tart acidity that one is expecting, there is also a fleeting whiff/hintof the green-feel hops. However, this slips away quickly to give way to the acidity in the blink of an eye.
The tastes mirror the nose with the apple acidity barging past a minor hop kiss to yield a typical wild rather than one that flirts with any hop presence. Each mouthful tempts us with hops, but within a few seconds it's all gone, snatched away by a more classic, wild element. Puckering acidity in the initial tastes lets up to give a more manageable and somewhat familiar fruit acid as the beer warms and is is consumed.
A very nice example of a 'yet-to-be-well-defined' style with the tiniest of nods to the hops, but if you've EVER drunk a west country cider in the UK you've seen this ALL before. The similarities between this beer and the cider that I grew up with as a thirteen+ year old are inescapable and have extreme synergy. All the way from the puckering apple acidity, through the light, manure funk and into the first quenching, then drying mouthfeel, this beer is ultimately no more than an American version of a British classic and it owes its existence to a place, time and beverage that has gone before."
Triangle Brewing Company,Triangle Belgian Golden Ale,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,8.0%,can,4.23,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,3/10/11,"Same beer as this review; http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/16186/38572/?ba=Ding but this time from the 12 oz can. Purchased at The Beer Dispensary in Apex, NC, USA.
Very much the same feel as before with the sweetness coming through as the main asset. This beer is sweet enough to be firmly in the Tripel category for me. You've GOT to enjoy some phenolic esters and a LOT of sweetness to get your head around this.
The color does seem lighter, clearer and more golden compared to the last review and it looks good.
Still very drinkable for me and the can does offer some more flexibility for some but not sure that it is necessary."
Ska Brewing Co.,Modus Hoperandi,,,American IPA,6.8%,can,3.90,4.5,5,3.5,4,3.5,3/9/11,"12 oz can from the Beer Dispensary, Apex, NC, USA.
I've had this beer a few times before, but this is the first review.
There is absolutely no doubt that the nose that the beer generates is absolutely unique and extraordinary. A big, fat, green, fresh hop presence that lingers and is the highlight of the beer for me.
The copper colored, clear body gives a tremendously impressive head and a lot of sticky lace. Good signs.
Some metallic notes and plenty of bitterness that lingers and drives the beer into some dark territory. The beer is actually increasingly aggressive and doesn't let up much. Slight alcohol burn in the back end, finish and burn in the end. Plenty of resinous pine but lacks much grapefruit based sweetness. Quite harsh but paradoxically drinkable.
Hoppy burps ensue.
Hop heads dream, and aggressive, American, modern classic."
SweetWater Brewing Company,Sweetwater Dank Tank Mean Joe Bean,,,American Porter,8.5%,bottle,3.13,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,3/9/11,"22 oz bottle in the usual Dank Tank presentation this time with a brown and yellow motif.
The pour is basically black with a few brownish highlights at the extreme edges.
Head is quite small and lacks any retention or lace, a little disappointing.
Nose has a surprisingly lack of coffee element and is mainly dominated by a malty, alcohol note.
The mouthfeel is very light which I suppose could be taken one of two ways. Either the beer is very drinkable and easy, or it lacks presence for a beer that with the ABV should really be an Imperial Porter. The tastes lack coffee for me and only replicates a simple alcohol based malt beer which does not have much presence. Meh...
I dunno, this comes up short for me in virtually all areas. It ought to have more depth, it ought to have more coffee, it ought to have more taste but it doesn't.
Frankly a bit disappointing, a bit light and a bit lazy for the type of beer it should be."
Brouwerij Kerkom,Bink Grand Cru,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,13.0%,bottle,4.93,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,2/26/11,"750 mL bottle with a synthetic 'cork', silver foil and cage with black cap. Cork is wedged in pretty tight, it is a pain to open. Also, the lack of 'pop' and lack of gun-smoke is a little disappointing.
In anything other than bright light, the beer looks black. In stronger light the body is seen to be a shade or two lower getting into the very, very dark brown region with even a few red notes/highlights in the extremities.
Aggressive pour was required (at least by me, since I am a fan of creating some decent head on the beer). Tan head is short-lived and recedes to give a thin, spotty film on the surface. Considering the ABV, I can live with both the carbonation and the head, even if I would like them both to be more substantial.
Nose offers tremendous sweet malts, alcohol and a light licorice element. It permeates the room from the glass!
The licorice is carried forward into the tastes, but unlike some other, similar licorice elements in other beers this one offers a sugar coated experience with a lack of bitterness. The alcohol is definitely in the picture (and at 13%, why not?), and there is plenty of rum and raisin character that comes through.
Massive sweet marzipan, other almond tastes and further brown sugar, licorice and dark fruits collide quite violently on the tongue.
The aftertaste is that of a classic, English Barleywine with a barrage of even more alcohol and further light roasted caramel and a REALLY pronounced warming effect.
The mouthfeel offers some 'better than expected' prickliness and a paradoxically smooth (but more 'in character') middle and finish.
Look, this is a BIG beer in all respects, but it does manage to pull off a tremendous combination of attributes that are all within the style. It's NOT for the feint of heart, nor is it for those who do not like the classic dark fruit based, Belgian candy styles, or beers that are not sweet. However, if you ARE in that category (as I am), you're gonna love this. 
Considering the ABV, the beer is off the charts for drinkability.
Strap yourself in and hold on for dear life! WOW!"

Relatively new entrant to the Atlanta market. Th e pour gives a clear, copper colored body with a one finger head. Head is unfortunately poorly retained and there is virtually no lace. Color is pretty though.
I'm very surprised at the hoppy nature of the nose. It's quite striking under any circumstances, and considering the style that is even more amazing. The tastes also give up some of that hoppy element, but it's not quite as strong as the nose initially suggests.
The beer is quite clean and dry, and imparts a refreshingly metallic note. The bitterness builds quite substantially.
Not at all what I was expecting for the advertised style, and the beer combines an interesting combo of styles that sit somewhere between an IPA and dry, clean red/amber ale. It's very hoppy when considering the APA style."
Yo-Ho Brewing Company,Tokyo Black,,,American Porter,5.0%,can,3.28,4,3,3.5,3,3,2/26/11,"12 oz can from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA, a little while ago.
Genuine import since the adhesive sticker that yields the Government warning obscures the original Japanese text that is printed on the can.
Black pour with a few red highlights, largely in keeping with the style. Head is not great, but sticky lace does suggest some quality.
Also in keeping with the style it lacks refinements and delivers an aggressive, watery feel without depth or creaminess. Bitter character comes through quite a lot and the beer drinks less easily than I would hope.
Bitter."
"Bell's Brewery, Inc.",Bell's Oarsman,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,4.0%,bottle,2.90,3,2.5,3,3,3,2/25/11,"12 oz single from Ale Yeah, Decatur, Atlanta, GA, USA.
A very pale, hazy yellow pour with a pretty small head and little retention or lace.
Nose and tastes are citrusy and light, but lack any depth for me. It's not complex and beers of this ABV CAN BE! There are a few light (relative) sour notes.
It seems to me that Bell's are getting away with a little something here. They are filling a gap in the US market, but they are doing it with a beer that's not very good. However, the gap in the market make it looks better than it really is. It's a missed opportunity.
In the final analysis Oarsman is just a very ordinary beer, BUT the lack of American session beers has people elevating it beyond its station. It's really not very good. Shame."
Brauerei Heller-Trum / Schlenkerla,Aecht Schlenkerla Eiche,,,Doppelbock,8.0%,bottle,4.70,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,2/25/11,"The usual Schlenkerla bottle shape, purchased from Green's on Ponce in Atlanta, GA, USA.
The pour is a particularly attractive, gold color with a moderate, white head. It looks really nice in terms of the color, but I would much prefer a bigger and better retained head. It lacks a little in that department, but the color is really superb. Very nice carbonation.
The nose delivers the usual Schlenkerla bacon smoke, but it seems more complex and layered than some of the other Schlenkerla beers. The oak smoke seems VERY intense, but paradoxically more subtle than some of the similar beers from the brewery. The oak clearly brings a different feel. The beer lingers too. 
Complex malts with plenty of sweetness to compliment the smoke. There is also a lingering bitterness that builds and as the beer is consumed it really feels mildly hoppy at the end - THAT, I wasn't expecting. Strangely, the ending also comes in sharply sweet. It also delivers a little bit of solvent like alcohol in the finale.
A VERY complicated beer for me with plenty of rich, layered and competing factors that compliment one another brilliantly. A tremendous experience for me. 
Like all of the Rauch's this is best paired with food and the sheer multitude of meats and cheeses that this could pair with is astonishing - perhaps even infinite!"
"August Schell Brewing Co., Inc.",Schell's Pilsner,,,German Pilsener,5.6%,bottle,2.60,1.5,3,2.5,3,2.5,2/24/11,"12 oz single - thanks to Kevin for the chance to try this one.
Pour is a very odd color. It has a watery pale look, but also has a slightly bizarre hazed, wheat-like look. The head is not really of any consequence and there is a thin film of froth on the surface. No lace. The color is very disturbing to me - it looks both washed out and cloudy. Strange.
Nose has some dry, grainy alcohol and a little degree of sweet malt.
There is a hint of bitterness that permeates the beer (good), but it also delivers a paradoxical grain based, vegetal, corn sweetness. The alcohol (solvent) comes through in a bit, more in terms of taste than burn. 
I don't like this much, and the appearance is particularly bothersome. The tastes are not THAT bad, but at the same time Germans everywhere are afraid - very afraid."
Minhas Craft Brewery,Minhas 1845 Pilsner,,,German Pilsener,5.5%,bottle,2.03,2.5,2,2,2,2,2/24/11,"12 oz bottle courtesy of Kevin.
The pour delivers a color that is darker and more orange than I would like to see from a Pils. It has a slightly hazed, copper tone and doesn't give a very clean appearance. The head is a quick, one finger affair but it disappears very swiftly. No lace.
Nose and tastes are at first watery and grainy, and then cut in with a huge dollop of sweetness. The sugar seems very artificial and quite chemical in its nature. The lack of body continually repeats itself.
Strange aftertaste and a weak experience. Minhas is producing a colossal amount of really poor beer - I suppose there must be a market for it, but I'm not part of that demographic."
Ale Asylum,Hopalicious,,,American Pale Ale (APA),5.8%,bottle,2.35,4,3,2,2.5,2,2/20/11,"Many thanks go out to Kevin for the opportunity to sample this beer.
12 oz single. At first glance, from the general appearance and more obviously from the name, it seemed to me as though this was going to be some huge, American DIPA that would be a real plate abuser. On closer inspection it reveals that the beer is not supposed to be that at all, and it's just a swell since it did not appear especially hoppy at all. In fact, the name was somewhat ironic in both the respect that it was not notably hoppy OR delicious!
Anyway - the pour is a hazy, deep orange with a nice white head that looks pretty good. if the truth be told, the best aspect of the beer is to be found by simply looking at it, the rest is somewhat downhill from there.
A few notes of bitterness are backed up by a weakish malt base and a lack luster mouthfeel. Somewhat watery I thought, and the beer lacked much depth or presence. Grainy alcohol comes through a bit amongst the sweetness, but overall there's nothing of any substance to report.
Finish leaves me wanting something else, as the tastes fade in an alarming manner. Compare this to a run of the mill American Pale like Sierra Nevada's and it fares even worse."
"August Schell Brewing Co., Inc.",Lakemaid,,,American Adjunct Lager,4.5%,bottle,2.90,3,2.5,3,3,3,2/20/11,"12 oz single from Kevin, thanks mate.
Pour offers a slightly hazed yellow body and an aggressive dispensing yields a pretty decent head if truth be told. Obviously little retention and/or lace, but not bad considering everything.
Nose and tastes do no more than a beer of this style and nature should. A sweet, grainy, vegetal note with limited bitterness and weak malts.
Mouthfeel is average for the style and the beer delivers a thoroughly underwhelming experience pretty much across the board.
Slightly strange aftertaste that has some lemon or other citrus, but the total package is still pretty light on any kind of flavor or character.
Ho hum; it is what it is and not a drop more."

22 oz presentation in the usual, Heavy Seas Mutiny series bottle.
I have been generally VERY disappointed with the Heavy Seas range of Mutiny beers over the last couple of years so i have had my expectations lowered considerably.
Pour is a requisite dark brown, but fails to reach strong levels of black at any point in the glass. Quite a small head, not much retention or lace. Generally disappointing to look at.
The nose here is quite weak, and the tastes follow suit. Sure there are chocolate notes and some bitterness amongst those roasted malts, but the overall package feels quite weak to me. This of course may be a function of age, but it ought to be able to stand up to some cellaring - maybe not. Some dark chocolate powder (cocoa), but it feels washed out and lacks maltiness. Weak.
Mouthfeel lacks richness and the beer feels light to me. Not a good sign for the style.
Disappointing. Weak."

This is a beer with some presence. I like it a lot.
The pour looks substantial with a heavy, copper colored body and some really nice, thick white head.
Nose and tastes deliver some substantial, malts that are nicely complimented with a decent splash of bitterness. The hop profile is noticeable and definitely brings a presence that is unusual for the style, AND gives more punch than a beer with this kind of ABV would be expected to deliver.
The bitterness lingers longer than i would think it would as well, and with it comes a satisfying feeling of alertness. This beer is one to be reckoned with on a number of levels and I like it very much. A little soap in there too.
Good punch, a beer than delivers nicely. Ballsy for the ABV."
French Broad Brewing Co.,Anvil Porter,,,American Porter,6.0%,on-tap,3.98,3.5,4,4,4,4,2/20/11,"On Tap at Taco Mac, Prado, Sandy Springs, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Nice to French Broad bringing out a new product.
Requisite black pour but with a somewhat poor head - maybe as a result of some dodgy Taco Mac barstaff, but not sure.
Pretty standard fare here. Light roasts sit throughout the nose and tastes and deliver a mild charcoal amongst the sweet malts. Well balanced and somewhat less aggressive than many American versions of the original, this beer delivers a fair bit of sweetness and most important to me, a nice creamy mouthfeel that is sometimes missing in American Porters.
Goes down easy and satisfies with simplicity.
Drinkability is pretty good, and a beer that couple with a sensible ABV is a porter that could be consumed in larger quantities. Went well with the cooler weather and a hearty dinner."
Jailhouse Brewing Company,Mugshot IPA,,,American IPA,6.7%,on-tap,4.58,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,2/20/11,"Wow, I really, really, really like this beer.
Pour is a mid-orange/copper with nice clarity, a little chill haze and a head that although present, could be better - HOWEVER, I watched the barstaff at Taco Mac pour this, and know that they did not do a good job so I suspect I could get a better appearance than they managed.
Nose and tastes are SUBTLE! Imagine that! Very light fruits with some subtle, sweeter fruits like peaches, but a healthy dose of sweetened grapefruit giving the true IPA moniker. Very easy to drink, and a beautifully balanced IPA that will not assault your taste buds, rather it will caress them.
Gentle, appropriate carbonation, and despite the poor pour, a good amount of lace on the glass. Finish gives a kiss of more bitterness and a lingering fruity feel. Some hoppy burps, too.
Delicious beer that restores my faith is beautifully, gentle, crafted beer with a subtle and non-aggressive edge. Delightful"
Maumee Bay Brewing Company,Buckeye Beer,,,Czech Pilsener,5.2%,bottle,2.08,2.5,2,2,2.5,2,2/20/11,"12 oz single courtesy of Kevin.
For a beer that has a Czech Pils moniker, it has a heck of a lot of adjunct lager character!
Head retention is pretty weak and the beer delivers a nose that is chocked full of vegetal sweetness.
The aroma characteristics are somewhat 'bothersomely' repeated in the tastes and frankly they do not improve much. The nagging sweetness replaces what should be a dry, clean, bitter Saaz bite in the finish, and the beer generally under performs horribly for the style, and frankly doesn't do any more than just that.
In a blind taste test I might have simply seen this as no more than a nasty, American adjunct."

Pour is an encouraging, reddish brown affair with some nice clarity and good, attractive highlights when the light catches it correctly. The head is a little small, quite poorly retained and lacks much lace, so the good work provided by the color is unfortunately undone almost immediately. Shame.
The carbonation seems a touch low.
A malty beer with fairly simple caramel and sweet characteristics without getting complicated. However, it does seem really light in many important areas including tastes depth, nose and satisfaction/mouthfeel. I was initially encouraged by the sensible ABV, and I do like a good bock, but this seemed to lack depth and the German yeast components that are essential to such a beer.
Has the potential to be good, but ultimately it misses on most fronts. Disappointed, as I really wanted (and tried) to like this much more. As far as Minhas goes this is NOT their worst effort by some distance, but in the end it's still pretty poor."
Minhas Craft Brewery,Berghoff Prairie Lager,,,German Pilsener,?,bottle,1.38,2.5,2,1,2,1,2/20/11,"12 oz single, from Kevin - many thanks.
Oh dear, this is not very good at ALL! I like the label and the general appearance of the bottle, it's a shame that this is by far the best aspect of this particular beer! Should i eat the label instead of drinking the beer?
To be fair the beer does pour with a Pilsener appearance in terms of color, carbonation and clarity, but the head is woeful and the lace non-existent.
The tastes and nose are INCREDIBLY sweet, even for my sweet tooth and obviously horribly out of place in a Pils. The Germans would be horrified by this I feel. It's got macro adjunct written all over it - straw colored, vegetal, corny tastes mingle amongst the overpowering sugar rush. Pretty much undrinkable in the final analysis.
German Pils? Good grief!"

Pour offers a strangely red tinge to the beer with plenty of white head. The color goes beyond amber and to another level. 
Nose offers little, but the tastes do deliver a touch more that I was expecting. Some light acidity on the malts and a light dry character that no-one is calling 'hoppy', but on the other hand does deliver a certain non-sweet note.
Ordinary? Sure, but a beer that doesn't leave me unhappy, if at the same time doesn't thrill. The mouthfeel and depth of character are lacking somewhat, but at the same time it's not a complete disaster."
The Matt Brewing Company,Saranac Rye Pilsener,,,Rye Beer,4.8%,bottle,3.50,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,2/20/11,"12 oz single, thanks to Kevin for the chance to try this.
Rye beers (of any description) are not really my thing so I approach this with a degree of trepidation. 
the beer pours as a totally clear, golden straw color with a small, white head. Carbonation is decent and leaves a touch of lace.
With the combo of pale malts and, hops and rye, the beer does deliver a clean-cut edge with a degree of bitterness up front. However, this beer is not really deep. Finish is short and dry (good), but lacks much presence. The rye bitterness builds a bit and is an interesting alternative to a noble hop bitterness but never fully replicates it,
A little graininess to it, and a beer that although not sweet per se, seems sweeter than it should be for the type of brew that it is.
No complaints here since the beer delivers a refreshing experience, but in no way is this a beer that is memorable or lingers on the palate. OK, I suppose, but still leaves me saying, ""ho hum"" a bit. Wouldn't turn down a few in the height f summer, but never a beer that I would seek out again."
The Matt Brewing Company,Saranac Amber Wheat,,,American Dark Wheat Ale,4.8%,bottle,3.40,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,2/20/11,"12 oz bottle as a single from Kevin. Thanks mate.
The beer pours with a lovely, dark golden color with a decent white head that leaves a little lace. There is a touch of haze to the beer which seems appropriate for the style.
Nose offers very little outside of some weak malts and a little grain.
Tastes are quite dry with a short finish. Plenty of pale malts with the faintest kiss of hop bitterness in the final flourish. More dryness in the aftertaste. The malts have a little biscuit nature about them, which is nice, but to be honest the beer drinks a little watery and lacks a real depth of mouthfeel. Some light caramel.
Sensible ABV adds to the drinkability for me.
Drinkable and OK, but this is not a beer that I'm going to seek out again."
The Matt Brewing Company,Saranac Helles,,,Munich Helles Lager,4.8%,bottle,3.90,4,3.5,4,4,4,2/20/11,"12 oz single courtesy of Kevin.
A good clean, bright (appropriate) pour with a head head that is not especially well retained or leads to much lace.
Carbonation is good amidst the golden, clear body.
Some light, peppery spice on the aroma and tastes that also lend a degree of bitterness. Sharp and clean, the beer gives away its sharp roots with a combination of dry, stinging bitterness. This is by no means the harshest of the style I have had, not does it deliver the real sting of solid Saaz (or other noble) 'bite', but it definitely captures the genre quite nicely.
Happy to have tried this. Saranac by Matt is a funny range of beers since there is seldom anything that stands out, but you can usually get some good value and decent beer in the style. This is one of their better efforts for me."
Great Divide Brewing Company,Grand Cru,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,11.0%,bottle,3.03,3.5,3,3,3,3,2/19/11,"22 oz bottle with the usual, Great Divide presentation. Red foil on this one.
Dark copper, garnet colored body with good clarity and a small, off-white head. In the Chimay chalice the beer leaves some decent lace and a thin, creamy spotty head on the surface of the beer.
The nose is where things get interesting to say the least. There is some sweetness that I was expecting, but there is also a dose of some hop character. 
The tastes are also pretty odd. There's a lot of sweetness, but not really a lot of fruit character or Belgian yeast notes. The lack of yeast is areal disappointment. Plenty of syrupy alcohol and again, a strange, out of place hoppiness. This beer drinks like a HUGELY sweet IPA. It's extremely odd. There's also an odd smokiness to the beer, too.
Don't come here looking for a typical BSDA, this isn't it, rather it's a strange combination of sweetness and a thinnish IPA with a bit of smoke in the mix.
ODD, and not to my liking really and unrecognizable in the style."
Terrapin Beer Company,Terrapin TomFoolery,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,7.3%,bottle,3.65,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,2/17/11,"22 oz bottle, $7.99, #14 in the Side Project series.
I'm immediately put on the defensive by the idea of a 'Black Saison'; as a traditionalist and a person that really loves a great Saison this doesn't really fill me with a lot of inspiration or hope. 
Jet black body with a small, creamy head.
Some nice lemony, citrus notes in the nose, and a simple replication in the tastes. Some nice, sharp orange peel and a few light spices and white pepper in there too. Very, very minimal roastiness (which I am glad about), but then again why use the dark malts?? There's a decent dose of bitterness, but it's based in saison tartness and a light spicy nature rather than a roasted element. I don't get much rye either, which for me is also a good thing.
A smooth creaminess in the mouth comes with the fine bubbles.
Although I enjoyed the beer somewhat, I really don't see the point of use use of the dark malts. They really don't bring a significant roast character, and since they don't do that, why not just brew the beer with a more traditional grain bill? It comes across as gimmicky, i.e. a stunt to make something 'different' - that bothers me a little."
Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company,Big Eddy Russian Imperial Stout,,,Russian Imperial Stout,9.5%,bottle,3.58,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,2/16/11,"12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour is a nice looking one, with all the requisite attributes for the style, plus some really nice alcohol legs. Head and lace are not amazing, but solid.
Nose is pretty strong, but mainly in alcohol and little else. Usually that's not a good sign but this particular aroma sits OK with me.
Very light in the mouth which adds to the drinkability. The beer is a collection of maltiness wrapped inside more alcohol. Obviously some roastiness but very little harsh bitterness. There are a few notes of various chocolates (both dark & light), and the beer comes together rather well.
Quite an easy drinker and light in the mouthfeel, but the beer does give a very significant alcohol taste and delivery.k"
Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),Infinium,,,Bière de Champagne / Bière Brut,10.3%,bottle,3.35,4.5,4,3.5,2.5,2.5,2/13/11,"Elaborate bottle that I acquired for the somewhat bargain basement price of $16.99. Delighted to get it for that kind of money since there seems to have been a very mixed reception for this beer.
Poured into the champagne flute, the appearance lives up the style with a hazed, darker than one might expect, peachy, golden body and a hugely effervescent head.
The nose offers a dry, acidic alcohol aroma that is promising.
The tastes on the other hand are nowhere near as dry as I was expecting, and give (in parts) quite a lot of sweetness and apple taste. The beer also comes across with quite a heavy handed syrupy feel and is nowhere near as dry as I was expecting or hoping. In fact, the beer is really quite viscous and not easy to drink.
A beer in this style would need to be WAY drier, crisper, lighter and less sweet if I were to go near it again. I didn't dislike it as such, but this beer is far too laborious for the style and couple with the alcohol is quite a big effort.
Not an easy beer, and I've had many better in the style and it seems as though these two brewers ought to have come up with a better beer. At $16.99 I wasn't happy with the price, at a higher price point I would have been increasingly annoyed."
Cigar City Brewing,Maduro Oatmeal Brown Ale,,,American Brown Ale,5.5%,bottle,3.85,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,2/13/11,"===Updated Review 04/11=== This bottle straight from the brewery thanks to Joey. 1000x better. No infection issues here.

A lovely, deep brown color with some decent head and retention. Not much lace, but still looks nice. Decent depth on the color too with some nice red hues coming through.

A nice, smooth nuttiness permeates the whole experience and leaves that lingering malty character that one really wants with a brown ale. 

Carbonation does feel a little prickly which detracts from a creaminess that I usually need in a brown ale, but it's not too off-putting. 

ABV could drop another % point or so too, but again not much to concern me here.

Tasty, and delighted to get a 'proper' bottle this time. Scores adjusted.

Original Review 02/11
===

Original scores: 4.0, 3.5, 2.0, 3.5, 2.5

12 oz single, thanks to Steve for the chance to try this one.

Pours with a decent brown body and a head that receded quite quickly but did leave some lace. 

A slightly acidic note comes off the beer which has me thinking CCB infection again - is it my imagination? The nose suggests a much bigger nutty note than the taste delivers, and once again an acidity comes through to spoil the malty experience that such a brown ale should deliver.

I have no idea if this was one of the many infected batches of beer from CCB, but it seems oddly acidic to me and doesn't stack up well as a brown ale for me. Another CCB disappointment, I'm getting a little tired of this.

Lake Placid Pub And Brewery,Ubu Ale,,,American Strong Ale,7.0%,bottle,3.65,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,2/12/11,"I had a few of these fro the first time back in the Summer of 2010, but this review is from a 12 oz bottle.
Pour is a dark brown with blackish, red highlights and a resplendent, high, mocha colored frothy head. Head retention and lace are both very good.
An extremely solid, malty nose suggests depth, and a lot of it.
Tastes don't quite deliver what the nose suggested, but still give a hearty malt based beer with some alcohol and a decent dose of bitterness. A tiny amount of oxidized, sweet liquor character that I was not expecting. Finish has more malts and the beer feels quite filling and expansive.
This is a beer that whilst although not heavy, certainly has some depth and delivers a malty experience that others in the style shy away from. Sort of a cross between a Wee Heavy and an American Strong, the beer is much more subtle than some American versions and brings plenty of malt to the table.
Interesting."
Les Trois Mousquetaires,Série Signature Kellerbier,,,Keller Bier / Zwickel Bier,5.5%,bottle,3.58,5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,2/12/11,"750 mL corked & caged bottle. Opens with a decent pop. Arbor Place Beverage, Douglasville, GA, USA.
Hazy, butterscotch orange pour with a splendid head. The head is very ice-cream like, and threatens to be almost solid. Thick white density with retention to match. Great looking beer.
Nose gives a characteristic musty, rye note which is carried into the taste. The tastes give quite a bitter, peppery note that lacks the charm or fruitiness of a beer like a Saison, or the sweetness of a Tripel, two styles that also offer some pepper. This seems more black pepper than white pepper.
Not a style I care for a lot, but this did look fantastic and offered a pretty nice drink, but the musty character lingers a little and it's what turns me away from these beers a bit."
New Belgium Brewing,Lips Of Faith Dunkel Weiss,,,Dunkelweizen,9.0%,bottle,4.45,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,2/12/11,"22 oz bottle, the usual Lips of Faith series presentation from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour gives a lovely black color (in poor light), but a more traditional brown based beer in better light. The head is tight, and mocha in color with a nice amount of retention and lace considering the ABV.
The worry with the ABV of 9% is that the solvent alcohol may begin to take over the beer and rob it of its normal style characteristics. Fortunately it doesn't, and the beer delivers all of the requisite banana, bubblegum and alcohol sweetness that one would expect. Lots of repeated waves of estery, fruitiness and a solid warmth from the alcohol in the finish.
All in all nicely put together, and the beer drinks very well.
Another tasty beer in the series."
"August Schell Brewing Co., Inc.",Schell's Bock,,,Bock,6.1%,bottle,3.60,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,2/9/11,"12 oz single, thanks go out to Kevin for the chance to try this one.
Pour is a slightly reddish brown, with some good clarity, a smallish head that is not retained all that well and does not really give much lace.
The nose and tastes combine to yield a very nice malty, alcohol flavor that is compact and fairly short without fuss. The beer is pretty light with a straightforward approach that delivers a bready finish and some simplicity and depth that is uncommon. Robust, perhaps a little nutty and definitely yeasty, the alcohol pops in for a brief appearance in the final flourish too.
Nice beer in the style which pleases me but may be a little too simple for some."
Cigar City Brewing,Improvisación Oatmeal Rye India-style Brown Ale,,,American Brown Ale,9.0%,bottle,1.88,3,2,1.5,3.5,1.5,2/6/11,"Given to me as a gift from a well-known bar owner. Many thanks.
750 mL capped bottle. Not really sure what a Oatmeal, Rye, India Brown Ale is, but...
Opening produces a HUGE gusher - not a trivial amount of beer lost, in fact around one third of the total contents are lost on the kitchen counter. Makes me think 'infection' or a best 'over-carbonated', we'll see.
The pour gives a frankly UGLY, chocolate brown color to the body that looks like viscous med - totally opaque. The head is obviously very good, well retained, a coffee-color and gives some nice lace. In that respect the beer looks good, but the color is just pain UGLY. An immediate paradox in the appearance.
The nose gives an acidic twang and some blue cheese. This makes me think Brett or infection.
The tastes reflect the nose and offer an acidic, light, blue cheese note and not much else. Funk is all over the place and the sour note persists through the beer, or at least the amount I can get down before drain pouring the rest of the bottle.
Disappointing."
Mad River Brewing Company,Jamaica Red Ale,,,American Amber / Red Ale,6.5%,bottle,3.50,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,2/6/11,"12 oz bottle as a single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA. Different label than the one in the BA db.
A slightly hazed, mid-brown pour sits underneath an off-white medium sized head and produces some better than average lace.
Nose dives up some dry hop notes.
Tastes are in line for the style and combine a decent hop and malt balance with the requisite dry finish. Aftertaste lingers to give some more residual hoppiness which is appropriate. Some mild alcohol burn in the back end and finish. The lingering bitter note is actually quite nice as it reminds you of the tasty beer you have just consumed.
A straightforward beer that showcases the style quite well without frills or drama. Decent beer."
Minhas Craft Brewery,Berghoff Sundown Dark,,,American Brown Ale,?,bottle,2.23,3.5,2.5,2,2.5,2,2/6/11,"12 oz single thanks go out to Kevin for the opportunity to try this beer. I do like the labeling and the presentation of the Berghoff beers, shame that's the best part of the beer.
Color is a surprisingly dark body with a smallish head. Minimal retention, minimal lace.
Carbonation seems better than average.
Nose and tastes give a disappointingly watery feel. Some light malts but the beer is overall grainy and does not produce any significant taste. Ultimately it is a very sweet beer and it does not give anything else. Blah.
Poor beer without interest, frankly."
New Glarus Brewing Company,Fat Squirrel Ale,,,English Brown Ale,5.8%,bottle,2.80,3.5,3.5,2.5,3,2.5,2/6/11,"12 oz single, thanks to Kevin for the chance to try this one. Always delighted to try a New Glarus beer, and this is no exception.
Pour provides a body that is quite clear and has a reddish-copper pour with a somewhat small head. Not much retention or lace.
Good malty nose, but unfortunately the nose does not really translate into much depth in the taste. Quite honestly, it tastes really quite weak. This is disappointing to me because if this were a really good example of an English Brown Ale it would have a lot more malty depth, and this does not. Even a little watery.
A tiny nut element and perhaps a modicum of smoke as well - shocking.
I dunno, I just expect more of NG, in a style that I thought that they might pull off, but it ended in a disappointing manner for me. Shame, an opportunity missed for me."
The Matt Brewing Company,Saranac Pomegranate Wheat,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,4.7%,bottle,2.70,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,3,2/6/11,"12 oz single, many thanks to Kevin for the chance to try this one.
Pour gives a peach colored body with some light, wispy head. Lace is minimal but nevertheless it is present.
Nose offers some light, acidic fruit but little else, even on warming.
Tastes are surprisingly neutral. I was expecting EITHER a blast of fruit, or a blast of wheat and in the end got neither! There is a little, light fruit acidity that the nose promises but it never gets significant and the wheat never manifests itself either.
I guess I wasn't expecting much and the beer delivers just about that much! Unoffensive but largely devoid of significant depth of flavor or character. Summer drinking? Maybe, but outside of that this beer is not likely to cut it for many people."
Great Divide Brewing Company,16th Anniversary Wood Aged,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,10.0%,bottle,3.55,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,2/5/11,"When this came out, rumor had it that this was exactly the same beer as the 15th anniversary. I have no idea about the validity of that statement, and it wound up in the BA db as a different beer anyway, so here goes.
The bottle has silver foil on the 22 oz neck. An aggressive pour produces a slightly hazed, mid-orange body and gives a lovely, dense, creamy white head. Looks a little like a latte floating on top of the beer.
Nose has a little soapiness (which I like), but it never gets strong. I would not have guessed that this beer was based upon Denver Pale Ale, but the label confirms.
The tastes are essentially a residual sweet, lightly woody, viscous sugary affair with some hop resin residuals as well. The alcohol is very well hidden and the sweetness (somewhat surprisingly) never gets very large. The beer walks a strange line between hops and sugar and I suppose works, but it's a real sipper and nothing that I would ever want more than one of, every 12 months or so. A fairly decent dose of vanilla, too.
Frankly I don't like this a lot, but it drinks more easily than I was expecting."
Hamm's Brewing Co.,Hamm's,,,American Adjunct Lager,?,can,2.18,3.5,2,2,3,2,2/5/11,"12 oz can, many thanks go out to Kevin for the chance to try this one.
Can and the brand make this look like a real retro beer - America in the 50's and 60's is the feel I get from it.
Pour is a very pale golden hue with a large, frothy head. The head has some decent retention and lace, and doesn't look bad a tall. To be honest, I did pour it in a very aggressive manner.
Nose and tastes are largely devoid of any character with a slight, sweet grain note and perhaps a little crisp citrus.
To be honest, as the beer warms it becomes increasingly water-like and the beer begins to lose its nostalgic charm.
Thought it may have been better than it was, but in the end it turned out to be just another dreadful, American, non-descript adjunct lager."
"Lakefront Brewery, Inc.",Eastside Dark,,,Munich Dunkel Lager,5.5%,bottle,2.18,4,3.5,1.5,3,1.5,2/5/11,"12 oz single, no freshness date to be seen (notches missing from the label). Thanks go out to Kevin for the chance to drink this one.
Pour is a surprisingly dark one, going beyond even the dark brown that was expecting and taking it to a new level with a close to black, stout like hue.
Head is good, rocky and pitted, produces some nice lace with its retention.
Smell has some malty goodness, and he beer in terms of the way it looks and smells is certainly promising. However...
...when we taste it is has a nasty, blue cheese like funk about it and not in a good way. this beer is either old, infected or a catastrophic effort at a Dunkel - maybe all three. Without freshness dates I feel obligated to review.
I manage to get a few mouthfuls down and then down the drain it goes. A shame because frankly this beer looks like it has potential, definitely one to go back and re-visit sometime in the future."
"Lakefront Brewery, Inc.",White Beer,,,Witbier,4.6%,bottle,3.00,3,3,3,3,3,2/5/11,"12 oz single courtesy of Kevin - many thanks.
The beer pours with a requisite, hazy lemon pour with a somewhat disappointing head. Retention and lace are lackluster to be honest.
The beer does contain all of the character that should be in a Wit, but it seems watery, light and without depth or presence. Slight touches or coriander, and orange peel but it simply isn't enough. The beer does come through with a little bit of citrus acidity, but the whole package is too light by far.
Too wishy-washy to give me an satisfaction, but to be honest the type of beer that probably benefits from a fresh pour, nearer the source. Not something that I am likely to experience in the near future though."
Port Brewing Company / Pizza Port,Midnight Expression,,,Schwarzbier,5.0%,bottle,3.43,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,2/5/11,"22 oz bottle, $4.99 from Smyrna Beverage World, Smyrna, GA, USA.
Black pour with an attractive, pitted, mocha colored head that is light and bubbly. Looks nice.
Nice is a somewhat neutral malty sweetness, even when warmed slightly.
The initial taste blast is a little unexpected and seems quite bitter and hoppy. I wasn't expecting this a all considering the style and it is really noticeable. I didn't like that jolt very much, but on the plus side as soon as it came, it faded and the middle and back end of the beer behaved in a much more standard fashion. Some light roast and a sweet back end give a more traditional flavor to the Schwarzbier.
Not bad, but not a style and therefore a beer, that I'm really fond of so I doubt I'll be visiting this again anytime soon.
It says something about he craft beer scene in the US when I am delighted by the fact that the beer is *only* 5%!"
Shaw Wallace & Company Ltd.,Haywards 5000 Super Premium Beer,,,American Adjunct Lager,7.0%,bottle,3.03,3.5,2.5,3,3,3.5,2/5/11,"A Super-Premium beer no less! What could possibly go wrong?!
Having spent a large portion of my first 35 years of life in Indian restaurants, I though that I had seen most of the Indian based adjunct lagers that one could be exposed to , but this was a new one on me. Went to an Atlanta curry house and sw it on the menu, but they were out. A few days later i picked up this gold foiled, 650 mL bottle at Total Wine, Perimeter, Atlanta, GA, USA for $2.49 (I think). 
There really is very little to report her in terms of the appearance (golden clarity, initially high carbonation, frothy head, small amount of lace and retention), nose (largely bland but with a grainy sweetness), taste (INCREDIBLY sweet, even by the standards normally associated with such things), or the drinkability (OK for what it is and it could wash down a hot curry), but for me the beer has a certain, strange charm. Perhaps it's the curry association, maybe the presentation, or perhaps even the marketing, but this is a beer that I enjoyed drinking and would re-visit.
If you cannot stand the sweetness I wouldn't be surprised, and to be fair I am not exactly recommending this, but for me it was a decent example of something that I was expecting little from."
Spoetzl Brewery,Shiner Blonde,,,American Pale Lager,4.4%,can,2.00,2,2,2,3,1.5,2/5/11,"12 oz can courtesy of Kevin - many thanks.
Well, it is what is. No more, no less.
Typical, light straw colored pour with perfect clarity, low carbonation and, virtually no head and zero retention and lace. Could be one of a million different macros of the same ilk, but the color is getting close to completely non-existent. Pale as plae can be.
Nose gives a touch of grainy alcohol.
Tastes are a largely neutral sweetness and almost nothing else. Character is firmly at zero, but no skunk and perhaps a slight bitterness in the swallow.
Somewhat refreshing, but so is water."
Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),Samuel Adams Latitude 48 IPA,,,American IPA,6.0%,bottle,3.95,4,4,4,3.5,4,2/2/11,"12 oz single, Total Wine, Perimeter, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Nice mid-copper pour with plenty of light carbonation and some decent, broken white, airy head.
For an American IPA the nose is really quite malty. It reminds me a little of a Sam Oktoberfest. Quite a shock.
Tastes are also strangely sweet and malt based with what comes across as a layering effect of bitterness from the hops. Middle, back end and finish combine to give quite a coinage metal effect and a short, sharp grapefruit ending.
I quite like this beer, and definitely enjoyed more than I though that I might. It delivers a very strong malt base behind the metallic and clean hop tastes, and a ll in all delivers a pretty satisfying bitterness. Some may be disappointed with the lighter touch that this American IPA delivers, but I on the other hand think it combines some decent, Nobel bite along with some simplicity.
Tasty, and a beer that works for me."
Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,Saison Du BUFF,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,6.8%,bottle,3.80,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,2/2/11,"12 oz single from my Secret Santa 2010 - thanks to finewinemike.
This is the third in the series for me, and I had pretty poor experiences with the Stone and Victory versions (the Victory was especially awful), so my hopes are low for this one. Having said that, this kind of things is something that DFH is likely to pull off better than the other two breweries involved so there is more hope.
Nice golden pour, with some attractive cloudiness that is appropriate for the style. Impressive, fluffy and pillow like head.
Nose and tastes do have a floral and herbal element, but it is nowhere near as aggressive and overwhelming as the other Saison Du Buff's. Quite a lot of lemongrass, and a full, fluffy mouthfeel. Not a great deal of complexity here in as much as it does not deliver any white pepper or any subtle fruit, phenol or ester notes, but it does end with a touch of spicy bitterness that lingers a little.
Much more in a classic Saison style than the other two 'Buff's' and in that respect I like it a lot more, and it sits better with me. best of the three by a LONG distance, and frankly that should not really surprise us given that DFH is a brewery that handles this type of beer better than Stone and Victory."
Jailhouse Brewing Company,Smokey,,,Smoked Beer,?,on-tap,3.93,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,1/30/11,"Very surprised to come across this - I hadn't heard that this was out, but delighted to try in when I took a break from the Atlanta Cask Ale tasting by slipping into the bar at Taco Mac, Prado with the wife.
Pour was a dark brown affair that was presented with far too little head. This was a pouring issue rather than a beer issue - a common problem when drinking at Taco Mac.
The beer was also too cold, which had an influence on the nose. With time, the beer did release its aroma and when they came it was worth the wait. Some decent, light, understated smoke.
Tastes were are very simple smoke, with some decent malt to back it up. the beer was pretty straightforward and simple, which for me is becoming both a signature trait and a great strength for Glenn and Jailhouse. If you want over the top, complicated nonsense then look elsewhere. If you want well made beer with a simplicity that yells 'quality' then Jailhouse is a brewery that will work for you.
Glenn has a commitment to a house style and to beer that has simplicity but solidly made. This is an interesting diversion which proves he has the capacity to step outside those parameters and do some interesting things. Jailhouse is truly a player to watch."
Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,Sierra Nevada Hoptimum,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,10.4%,bottle,3.60,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,1/30/11,"2011 vintage.
The 24 oz large format bottle that SN seems to have favored for this type of release for sometime now. $9.99 from Smyrna World of Beverage, Smyrna, Atlanta, GA, USA.
A very, very attractive looking beer. A beautiful golden, clear body with some significant white, frothy, sticky lace which is well retained considering the ABV, and is really pretty.
Nose has some alcohol, but frankly not a huge amount of hop presence when considering the nature of the beast.
The tastes are similarly sweet and slick as opposed to very hoppy. There's a little hop burn in the chest with the alcohol, but it doesn't tear at the palate in a massively aggressive manner. The slick mouthfeel is appropriate and to be expected when considering the style and the alcohol content.
There is a decent amount of solvent in the very back end, finish and aftertaste which takes a little away from the overall experience for me, but the beer never really delivers what I would call a huge hop battering. Some metal in the aftertaste too.
OK, but poor value for money."
Tommyknocker Brewery,Oaked Butt Head Bock,,,Doppelbock,8.1%,bottle,2.18,2.5,2.5,2,2.5,2,1/28/11,"12 oz single, Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour is a muddy, Dubbel-like mid brown with a disappointing lack of clarity.
Musty aroma with some blue cheese notes and a mild acidity - slight lactose aroma. Strange.
Tastes reflect the nose and offer a weird combination of light acidity (unexpected) amongst the more predictable smoke/oak notes and the malty, alcohol strong, Doppelbock flavors.
Not sure that there is any point in oaking a Doppelbock I think that there is precious little to be gained. This beer ends up being a messy version of something that would have been much better left well alone. For me, a classic example of what's bad about tinkering with beers."
Sand Creek Brewing Company,Sand Creek Golden Ale,,,American Blonde Ale,5.0%,bottle,1.80,2.5,2.5,1.5,2,1.5,1/27/11,"12 oz single, thanks to Kevin for the chance to try this beer.
Pour is a strange, hazed and cloudy pour with a butterscotch color.
This is a sweet, grainy, musty beer which frankly is pretty unimpressive. Some notes of cardboard and a mixture of lemony sweetness come together to produce a beer that is a prickly, fizzy, bland and watery concoction.
Not good, and I'm not sure what this is trying to be, but either way - no thanks."
Stevens Point Brewery,Horizon Wheat,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,3.7%,bottle,3.30,3.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,1/27/11,"12 oz single bottle. Thanks to Kevin for the chance to try this.
A nice, butterscotch colored, unfiltered look, Half decent head but not much lace.
Nose is pretty light and gives up nothing more than a touch of citrus and perhaps some vegetal notes.
The tastes are much better and deeper than the nose would suggest. Some citrus wheat, a little light bitterness and a decent fruity finish.
Decent taste and a beer that would be interesting fresher and on tap. Delighted by the ABV as well."
Great Divide Brewing Company,Rumble IPA,,,American IPA,7.1%,bottle,2.55,4,3.5,2,3.5,2,1/23/11,"12 oz single.
Pour gives a copper colored clarity and a nice, full white head. Quite creamy looking. The appearance is without question the highlight here.
Nose has a lot of soapy character and not much else. I like the soap note in the nose, but it does not really get carried forward into the tastes.
The beer is quite bitter - with a metallic twang. I'm not sure that oaking an IPA is a wise move, and the combination seems to create a very, very bitter affair with all the bad aspects of unrefined grapefruit and none of the good. A tiny vanilla note upfront is almost immediately overwhelmed. The bitterness does not have much charm, and it creates a burning nastiness that lingers for some time.
Not a good idea and not a beer that tastes good at all. If you want colossal bitterness with no let up, I suppose you may like it - I don't"
Pabst Brewing Company,Blatz Beer,,,American Adjunct Lager,4.9%,can,1.90,2,1.5,2,3,1.5,1/23/11,"12 oz can, many thanks to Kevin for the chance to try this.
The pour produces an almost transparent lemon yellow color, a highly carbonated but a typically poorly retained head and not much lace. Frankly it screams American adjunct lager which I suppose could be viewed as a good thing!
Light, grainy and neutral nose.
Tastes are watery and only give a sweet, light vegetal and light grainy effect.
Pretty much devoid of any character or taste but to be honest not offensive in any way. Still, pretty much exactly as one would expect"
The Lost Abbey,The Angel's Share - Brandy Barrel-Aged,,,American Strong Ale,12.0%,bottle,3.70,2,4,4,2,4,1/23/11,"375 mL bottle, corked and caged bottle from Mac's, Atlanta, GA, USA. $14 for the privilege. 11.5% on the label.
It's flat. 100% flat. Was pretty positive that it would be even before I bought it, but it still needs to be recorded.
The beer pours with a dark brown, mid-viscosity and obviously zero head, lace or retention.
The nose and tastes give what amounts to be a glass of sherry. Lots of rum & raisin ice-cream notes, other dark fruits, brown sugar and light, evaporating alcohol. A few woody notes, some sweet and sour balance and some drying apple.
Alcohol taste lingers in the finish.
Given the lack of carbonation, the beer is actually incredibly drinkable. I cannot imagine how much I would like this if it were even mildly carbonated. Essentially it's a poor mans Utopias.
I suppose that this is a ""beer"" that essentially can do without the carbonation, since its lack converts it to a sherry, i.e. a beer much like Utopias, but the annoying thing is that I don't suppose LA started out with the intention of producing a totally uncarbonated beer - did they?"
"Lakefront Brewery, Inc.",Wheat Monkey,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,4.2%,bottle,3.15,3,3,3,3.5,3.5,1/22/11,"12 oz bottle, many thanks go out to Kevin for the chance to try this.
Pour is a pretty standard, requisite hazed yellow color that looks a tad watery. A few yeast sediment particles that ultimately dissolve to add to the murky, unfiltered nature.
It is what it is, meaning it delivers a pretty average, very light, a tad watery body on top of diluted wheat notes in the nose and tastes.
It's fine, it acts as a decent thirst quencher. Light grain notes in the aroma and a very, very mildly acidic finish complete the picture.
For me, this style is really heavily dependent on two factors. Freshness and weather context. In the middle of a hot summer with the beer coming straight out of the tank, one could really get to love many American Pale Wheat's. Under less favorable circumstances of freshness and temperature, bees in this style can appear watery and bland."

Pour gives an alarming, quite dark orange color with a lot of dirty sediment and a large, billowing head. Lace is average, some stickiness.
Nose gives a blast of acidity that I take as a good sign, thinking theat there may be some depth to the flavor - there isn't, or at least nowhere near as much as the appearance and the nose would suggest.
Very ordinary in the mouth, the beer has a few wheat characteristics but ultimately fails to deliever in any significant manner. Perhaps a few citrus, lemon hnts of acidity but overalll disappointing.
I liked the presentation, shame that was just about the best part of the beer."
Terrapin Beer Company,Terrapin Hoptaneous Combustion,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,9.3%,bottle,4.00,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,1/22/11,"$9.99 for the 22 oz, foiled and boxed bomber. Bottle #2002.
Pour is a rather attractive golden color with some nice clarity. Head is tall, frothy and sticky. Retention is average, wish it was better to complete the visual package.
Nose is a typical, fruity hop bomb with some alcohol and largely in line for the style. If this were a blind tasting I don't think I would pick up any smoke at all, but knowing that there is some present the beer does reveal a hint - no more, but enough to let me know what's going on.
Unsurprisingly this is a big beer with a good smattering of typical grapefruit and peach fruit and a harsh ending. The finish is combination of quite jarring ethanol and hop resins.
There is a hint of smoke that runs throughout the beer and although it is slightly more noticeable in the tastes than the nose, I remain unconvinced that I would detect it blind. I suspect that I would say that the beer had a spiciness to it which I think can be attributed to the smoke, but without knowing that I might just say that it was 'peppery'.
The mouthfeel is a bit slick, but that's appropriate considering ABV and style.
The beer works well, BUT strangely I find myself craving more smoke! It's tasty but would be even better with more of the charred notes. Like most beers of its type it's going to work best with food.
The third and fourth beers in the theater series have proved to be much better than the first two, and have even done enough to restore a little faith in Terrapin. As ever with this series, value is lacking even when considering the cause."
"Lakefront Brewery, Inc.",IPA,,,American IPA,6.9%,bottle,3.60,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,1/16/11,"12 oz single, taken from notes, many thanks to Kevin for the opportunity to try this one. There IS a freshness ""strip"" on the side of the label, but as is sometimes the case, the notches are missing - frustrating.
A hazy orange pour, a sticky white head but a few yeast particles/floaties that I could do without. When the particles settle at the bottom of the glass we see some medium carbonation. The head is nicely retained and the stickiness is always a good sign for a beer like this.
Nose has plenty of light hops - nothing amazing, but nevertheless ""present"". A *slight* green hop cone note in the nose as well.
Tastes are those of a well tempered, American IPA. By that I mean there is plenty of hop bitterness, but the malt backbone hols it together well. A somewhat paradoxically fruity taste up front, followed by a dry finish. Interesting combination.
The finish is quite short, has a little metal and reiterates the dry character. Alcohol doesn't seem like it is almost 7%.
Pretty good example of the style, and a beer that I enjoyed more than I though that I might. Taken as a package, this is a beer that one could easily have on hand on a regular basis as a solid staple. Nothing earth shattering, but pretty solid."
"Lakefront Brewery, Inc.",Klisch Pilsner Beer,,,German Pilsener,5.4%,bottle,2.28,2.5,2.5,2,2.5,2.5,1/16/11,"12 oz single, from notes, many thanks go out to Kevin for the chance to try this beer. Label is slightly different to the one in the BA db where the words Pilsner Beer have simply become ""Pilsner"". Notched as being bottle in Wk 1, May but no year given, assuming 2010.
The pour yields a beer that has a pilsner color (perhaps it's a little more 'yellow'), but unfortunately it comes with a slight haze that substantially detracts from the clarity. Not really what I'm looking for here, and it upsets the balance of the look. In addition the carbonation seems a little low to me, and the head and lace could both be much better.
Nose and tastes are both very disappointing. They add up to what is simply a non-offensive macro, adjunct lager and not much else. There's no Saaz or Noble bitterness, and these is a lack of a clean edge. With those attributes missing, a beer that is supposed to be a genuine pilsner can drop off very quickly.
Weak, disappointing if at least NOT unpleasant."
Coors Brewing Company,Blue Moon Pale Moon,,,Belgian Pale Ale,5.4%,on-tap,3.70,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,1/15/11,"On draught at Buffalo Wild Wings, Douglasville, GA, USA.
Orange body with a small head and some sticky lace. Slight haze to the body.
Quite a surprising green/ fresh hop note in the nose. Agitating the beer produces even more of the same - wasn't expecting that!
No Belgian yeast character to speak of. The beer is quite 'snappy' with some really clean lines and some fairly well defined fruit notes. Light zing in the finish and a crisp drink.
Not bad at all. A simple beer which is a plus for me, a sensible (if not exactly low) ABV, combine to produce a tasty, balanced beer that is very drinkable. Light touch with some malt presence too.
Good beer, ""as a beer"" if NOT as an example of the style - in that respect it's poor."
East End Brewing Company,Gratitude,,,American Barleywine,11.5%,bottle,2.33,3.5,2.5,2,3.5,2,1/14/11,"2009 Blue Wax - thanks go out to PittBeerGirl for the chance to try this. 750 mL, paper-wrapped affair.
A hazy, orange copper color body with better head and lace that I was expecting for a beer of its size.
Aroma and initial tastes are excruciatingly sweet, and it's a sweetness that lacks the charm of an English Barleywine and comes charging at you with clumsiness.
The beer is a convoluted and confusing array of alcohol, sugar, malt and tastes that seem to be esters in their profile but are difficult to pin down.
I like sweet beers but for me, this is a unwieldy, aggressive, awkward and stumbling beer that lacks refinement."
"Middle Ages Brewing Co., Ltd.",Dragonslayer,,,Russian Imperial Stout,9.5%,bottle,3.43,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,1/13/11,"22 oz bottle that I purchased in a Wegman's in Binghamton, NY, USA.
Pour is exactly what one would expect; oily black body, with a thin, mocha film on the surface of the beer.
The alcohol in the nose seems a little strong and it has me a bit concerned for the tastes. In reality it doesn't manifest itself quite as aggressively as the aroma would suggest, but it is still a prominent feature.
At first I didn't think that this was going to be a very hoppy stout, but as the glass and bottle progressed it seemed to build in hop bitterness. A underlying very slight lactose note seemed to added to the sour/bitter elements and the beer got quite sharp.
Light roastiness runs across the middle of the palate and adds to the dry, bitter character.
Quite surprised at how hoppy this stout was. and that is generally not to my liking. I think this would do better in the American Double Stout category."
"Middle Ages Brewing Co., Ltd.",Duke Of Winship,,,Scottish Ale,6.5%,bottle,3.00,4,3,3,2.5,3,1/13/11,"12 oz single.
The label suggests that this beer is a cross between a Scotch Ale and a Porter. I'm not sure what that means, but in the final analysis the beer drinks largely like an American Porter to me.
""American"" in the manner that the hops are higher than the original English version, and the beer has a less creamy texture and finishes drier. No Scotch Ale character for me.
Dark brown pour with a few reddish highlights. Head is good and leaves some decent lace.
Nose has some malts but is fairly neutral. A few darker grains,
A little thin, lacks a creamy texture. Dry finish with a touch of bitterness and light prickle on the carbonation.
Not much going on here, but the beer is non-offensive. Unfortunately it is also non-memorable as well. Sort of a neutral beer for me."
Kuhnhenn Brewing Company,Kuhnhenn Fourth D,,,Old Ale,13.5%,bottle,4.00,4,4,4,4,4,1/12/11,"2008 vintage. 12 oz bottle.
Big thanks go out to finewinemike for the chance to try this as part of my Secret Santa 2010 box.
Pour is a dark brown, muddy affair with a huge, well retained coffee colored, ice-cream styled foam that eventually falls away to give a light foam.
Nose gives a fairly predictable sherry like note, but to be honest it comes with a little oxidative, mustiness that takes the edge of a little.
The tastes do something similar. A sweet, very light Madeira note dominates, but again a slightly oxidized, alcohol element cuts across the finish. there is even a noticeable last minute dash of acidity that confirms the oxidation. Not troublesome, more surprising.
The finish introduces the best part of the beer for me. I get some distinct pepper amongst the sherry and oxidized elements and it works well. Very interesting, very good but if I'm honest it did not live up to the (massive) hype,"
"Middle Ages Brewing Co., Ltd.",Wizard's Winter Ale,,,English Strong Ale,6.3%,bottle,3.48,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,1/12/11,"12 oz single. 
Murky. mid-brown/orange pour that creates some head but not much lace.
Nose offers a malty fruit base that adds a little bitterness that is reminiscent of grapefruit, but to be honest it's not a grapefruit taste that one normally associates with a high hop profile.
Similar things happen in the taste, where the slightly bitter grapefruit sits on the fruity end of the spectrum rather than the hop end of the scale.
As the paragraphs above would suggest, the beer is really quite fruity and only has a a hint of bitterness in the finish. Winter Warmer? I dunno, this seem quite malty and English in its taste and doesn't deliver any spice notes at all.
OK, but not a lot more."
Jolly Pumpkin Artisan Ales,La Parcela,,,Pumpkin Ale,6.0%,bottle,4.00,4,4,4,4,4,1/11/11,"750 mL bottle, Batch 610 bottled 8-13-10. Label says 5.9%, not 6.0% ABV.
Jolly Pumpkin is a frustrating brewery to me - more of that later. 
The pour produces a burnt orange hue with a small head that produces some nice, white lace. Looks good.
The nose and tastes are well,...Jolly Pumpkin! Light acidity, strong apple notes, plenty of cider character and the light funk and mild Brett character. They meld quite nicely together and the beer offers a sharp, refreshing and slightly ethanoic acid finish. Tasty, satisfying, but...
...ZERO, and I mean ZERO (as in totally devoid) of any pumpkin character, and that's central to my problem with JP beers in general.
The second half of the bottle produces a lot of nasty looking coagulated protein or sediment.
Frankly, being experienced with J beers I wasn't expecting a ""Pumpkin beer"", nor was I expecting anything other than the cider character than I got, so my question is WHY call the beer a pumpkin beer? Why not take the Fantôme route, and call ALL the beers that they make, some version of a Saison/Wild/Farmhouse??
It's confusing and a little frustrating."
Firestone Walker Brewing Co.,Firestone 13 - Anniversary Ale,,,American Strong Ale,12.0%,bottle,4.68,4.5,4.5,5,4,4.5,1/10/11,"22 oz, boxed bottle as per the FW Anniversary series.
A couple of inches of snow in Atlanta, another half inch of ice on top and a snow day gives me an unexpected opportunity to crack this one - not much else to do!
Beer pours essentially a jet black pour with perhaps some very dark brown colors at the extremities. A thin, tan head that recede to give a white color around the glass. 
The nose is strong even when the beer is cool, but becomes potent as it warms. The liquor and alcohol aromas are increasingly strong, and really sharp in the nose from several inches away, and noticeable from several feet! This concerned me a bit, since I was thinking that if this was going to manifest itself in the taste then I wasn't going to be too happy.
The tastes DO reflect the nose, but they are surprisingly mellow when considering the volatiles that are escaping the DFH signature glass. With over a year on this beer, there is a pretty large element of sweetness that stands up to the aggressive liquor notes and the alcohol. Make no mistake, this beer is still a big beast, but there is a tamed element to it, despite the warm that builds in the chest on the way down, and the light solvent touch that evaporates in the mouth as the beer is consumed.
I was very wary of this before I opened it as I typically don't care for the bourbon notes too much, but there is a whole bunch of other notes that combine to produce a great package; oak, a little smoke, vanilla, dark plums and molasses and rum. The alcohol stings and gives a touch of pepper as well. These tastes meld well with the bourbon elements to produce a full on assault that is surprisingly drinkable.
Tasty and better than I was expecting and certainly more drinkable."
"Middle Ages Brewing Co., Ltd.",ImPaled Ale,,,English India Pale Ale (IPA),6.5%,bottle,3.68,3.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,1/10/11,"12 oz single thanks to Rob.
Light , golden orange body with an initially, big rocky head that leaves some nice sticky lace. Slight haze/cloudiness. 
Nose and tastes are typically English in terms of the biscuity malts and the relatively restrained hop profile. I think that this is a slightly older bottle, so it may be that these attributes are a function of some time, and earlier on this beer was more ""American"" in its feel.
Light metal in the finish, but this adds to the clean feel associated with the beer. Some light peach and other soft fruits cut across the back end to end a sweetness to the beer. Surprisingly fruity actually!
Seems a touch thin in the mouth to metal.
Tasty and drinkable beer with a number of drinkable attributes."
Atlantic Brewing Company,Bar Harbor Blueberry Ale,,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,5.2%,bottle,2.70,3.5,4,2.5,2,2,1/9/11,"12 oz single, courtesy of Kevin - thanks mate.
A clouded, ""orangey"", copper colored pour with some scant white head but a lack of much presence or lace.
A somewhat attractive blueberry based fruit aroma comes off the beer, even when quite cold. This nose intensifies as the beer warms as the volatiles escape.
Tastes are unfortunately less attractive than the nose would suggest, but in a surprising way. Sometimes, beers like this a criticized for their ""imitation"" fruit flavors but that's not the problem here. In fact I would describe the blueberries are quite ""natural tasting"", however the beer is oddly sweet with a combination of sugar notes and high, solvent alcohol taste that makes it rather difficult to drink. It's a bit sickly sweet in its taste, and this is coming from someone that usually loves sweet beers. The combination does not meld very well together for me, and last third of the bottle is not consumed.
The beer ends up being too heavy, and I am looking for a brew with MUCH cleaner lines if I am picking up a fruit based beer. Here is seems like there is an unlikely combination of high sugar levels with excess alcohol! Seems odd, I know but whatever it is, and however it was achieved, it does not drink easily.
I am NOT against fruit beer in general, it just seems as though this one is not coming together very well."
"August Schell Brewing Co., Inc.",Schell's Dark,,,Munich Dunkel Lager,4.8%,bottle,3.13,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,1/9/11,"12 oz bottle, many thanks Kevin.
Interesting. I actually really like the presentation. The clear glass with the dark contents look appealing and interesting to me, and frankly whilst completely understanding and not disputing the chemistry, I feel that the number of problems with skunking are generally overblown a little. Anyway....
...a solid, chocolate brown colored pour with some great looking clarity. Carbonation is OK, but I wish that it provided a better head and some increased retention. If we could get that up a little this would be a really nice looking beer indeed.
Malty notes dominate (obviously) but with them becomes a touch of musty cardboard. Something similar comes in the tastes too, and ultimately I feel that this beer is one the verge of being quite tasty, but ultimately doesn't really cut it. There is a distinct German yeast note in there along with some sweet, malt based sugars, and in all all it's not bad at all.
Perhaps a touch thin, and whatever is needed to increase the body, the head retention and give the beer a little more depth of flavor, needs to be added to take this one over the top."
Mad River Brewing Company,Steelhead Double India Pale Ale,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,8.6%,bottle,1.98,1.5,2.5,2,2,1.5,1/9/11,"12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour is a rich, clouded, honey orange hue with an inordinate number of yest floaties. The combination of the color, floaties and general muddy appearance does nothing for the beer and frankly makes it appear somewhat ""soup-like"". This is not a good sign in my book. Head is strong though, and leaves lots of sticky lace.
Nose and tastes both give similarly muddled impressions. Hop bitterness and edge is lacking, and it is replaced by a large, unwieldy malt presence that manifests itself as unattenuated sugar. Strange. the beer lacks a clean edge in many respects, and it comes across as a ""kitchen sink"" beer. This type of concoction is a manifestation of all that's bad about contemporary, American brewing. The idea that somehow more of everything makes a beer, ""better"".
It's a soupy, unpleasant mess with hardly any redeeming features. A lot of stuff, poorly managed and thrown together. Alcohol is burning and aggressive to boot. the sugar and alcohol make it slick in the mouth.
Frankly, I think it is a poorly brewed beer."
"Middle Ages Brewing Co., Ltd.",Swallow Wit,,,Witbier,4.8%,bottle,3.08,2.5,3,3,3,3.5,1/9/11,"12 oz single from my brother-in-law - cheers Rob.
Not sure about this from the get-go. Is this a filtered Wit? Seems odd to say the least. The beer is golden with a small head but almost has zero cloudiness in the glass. Makes me feel odd, a bit like the disconnect between the appearance and taste that one finds in the American-style India Black Ales.
Smell offers some light lemon and that peculiar sinus clearing carbonation that can sometimes exist in a beer.
Lemon notes are less prominent in the tastes than the nose would suggest but still offers a decent blast of citrus. the carbonation is quite high and deliver some prickly mouthfeel elements. Finish is short and clean with a snappy, quick bitterness.
This is a drinkable beer, but as for being a typical Wit I would say no. All the way from the appearance through the lack of yeast/wheat character and the lack of any significant orange or coriander notes, I would say it is this lacks many of those attributes. It's OK, unoffensive and fairly simple, but it's not a beer that you would point to as being typical."
"Middle Ages Brewing Co., Ltd.",Syracuse Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),5.0%,bottle,3.50,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,1/8/11,"12 oz single.
I've always liked Middle Ages but they pulled out of GA a long time ago (at least I don't see their beer any longer in these parts), this bottle came from my brother-in-law in upstate NY - cheers Rob.
Slightly hazed, orange gold body with a soapy looking, one finger head. Head is light and frothy in appearance. Lace is minimal.
Carbonation seems a little low.
Tastes are fairly straightforward grains with a hint of bitterness in the back end. Light soapy tastes compliment the bitterness to yield a drier than expected finish.
Surprisingly I get a yew lemon notes in the beer which add to its lightness and make it pretty drinkable. Light lemon persists all the way through to the finish and the aftertaste.
An interesting beer in as much as it seemed a little more complex that I was expected. I was left with an impression by the lemon tastes and a feeling that this is a paradoxically simple and slightly more complex beer wrapped up in a single package."
Terrapin Beer Company,Terrapin Sound Czech,,,German Pilsener,5.5%,bottle,4.23,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,1/8/11,"#3 in the Georgia Theater series (although apparently this and #4 were seemingly essentially, simultaneously released), and as a pair they complete an extraordinarily large number of beers released by Terrapin in the last twelve months.
22 oz bottle with the usual presentation of the gold foil and the fancy box. $10.99 for the privilege.
Crystal clear, light golden clarity with an impressive, rocky, pillow-like head, great carbonation and some super lace. Very good looking indeed.
A really clean, light grainy nose with a dash of white pepper. Again, impressive for the style.
Clean body with the requisite character; clean lines, slight bitterness (in a Saaz/Noble type manner) and a short ending. Although good, perhaps paradoxically the tastes are the weakest part of the beer. I would like the bitterness to be a little more prominent.
Without question the best beer that Terrapin has put out amongst this muddled, confused and somewhat frantic recent series of side projects and other, ""special"" releases. Having said that, and despite the fact that I am very happy to pay a premium price for ANY premium beer (lower ABV ones included), the value is debatable even considering the cause."
Geary's Brewing Co.,Geary's Hampshire Special Ale,,,English Strong Ale,7.0%,bottle,3.05,3,3,3,3.5,3,1/6/11,"12 oz bottle courtesy of finewinemike as part of my 2010 Secret Santa package. This beer was on my Wants list for a long time, and I must admit I'm a bit confused by that - I *think* that's because BA used to have this categorized as an ESB, and a such I was interested in in. I have the feeling that this haas been re-categorized iin the BA db.
A very hazy, mid-orange pour that yields some frothy, ""dirty"" head and comes with some yeast sediment from the bottle. Some sticky lace.
Very strong bread nose with plenty of sweetness.
Tastes are similar to the nose in as much as we get a big blast of malt and plenty of biscuity character. There is (somewhat disappointingly) quite a lot of solvent alcohol taste, too. The sweetness (which is fairly intense), does temper the alcohol some, but the overall package feels STRONGLY ""American"" in a s much as it is pretty much devoid of much subtlety.
The English malt/biscuit character is there, however the beer stomps all over the simplicity of that. When the simple notes are lost, it seems a bit like the point of this beer is left behind.
I dunno, this feels like an ""Imperial ESB"" which in my book is an oxymoron - shame."
Rogue Brewery (Brewer's on the Bay),Rogue 21,,,Old Ale,8.0%,bottle,4.23,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,1/6/11,"Bought this several months ago, at Hop City, Atlanta, GA and paid the slightly absurd price of approx. $20! The bottle is pretty extravagant, even by ridiculous Rogue standards. My guess is that the price is why there are only 15 reviews before mine, despite the fact that this beer has been out for a LONG time.
The beer pours with a mid-brown, clouded body and a healthy, light tan head. Some decent lace considering the ABV.
The nose is not especially strong, even on warming. It reveals a little malty sugar but not much else.
The tastes are pretty interesting. Very, very well balanced slightly bitter malts, with virtually no hint of the alcohol. There is some simple sweetness up front, but this gives way to yield an extremely mild, light and gentle touch of hops - just a kiss.
The finish is very short and clean.
This is a very atypical Rogue beer, but the best that I've had (along with Maierfest) in recent years.
The price is the real issue here, and if you consider it alone this beer is dreadful value, however it IS a really nice beer. Very mild, subtle and surprisingly so for a Rogue beer. Drinkable, tasty and well-balanced. The latter not really a trait of Rogue beers!"
A1A Aleworks,Porpoise Point Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),5.4%,on-tap,2.93,3.5,2.5,3,3,3,1/2/11,"Decent looking pour with a golden body sitting underneath a small, white cap of foam.
Despite the small head, the carbonation seems quite aggressive and vigorous and a little prickly. Not much aroma, even after it warms. This beer clearly doesn't have a lot of volatiles present.
Semi-sweet grains with perhaps a touch of zesty fruit, but in no way is this beer either bitter or particularly tasty. Lacks much depth, but at least it is non-offensive. I found it refreshing and drinkable, but the beer doesn't really stand out in any way.
It's the kind of beer that I would be absolutely delighted to be able to produce in my garage, but at the same time also pretty disappointed if I couldn't! What I mean by that is that the beer doesn't have any flaws as such, but is truly a pretty mediocre effort for a professional outfit."
Cigar City Brewing,Bolita Brown Double Nut Brown Ale,,,English Brown Ale,9.0%,bottle,3.55,4.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,3,1/2/11,"750 mL from Broudy's Liquors in St. Augustine. $8.99 for the capped, dimple-bottomed, thick brown glass bottle.
Now under the name, ""Bolita Double Brown Ale"" (the ""nut"" part of the name is missing from this bottle).
Impressive, dark chestnut brown color with a really creamy, espresso type head that has nice retention and some very creamy, coating lace. Looks like the proverbial dark chocolate milkshake.
Plenty of malty, bready alcohol in the nose.
Creamy mouthfeel with a hint of acidity and perhaps even a touch of lactose character. The tastes do not give much in the way of nuttiness until the finish where there is a hint of hazelnut and a bitterness that one would associate with the outer skin of a Brazil nut. Drink more like a milk stout to me, and even though the label describes this as a ""Northern English Brown Ale"", if you took this to a working mens club in Salford I think you might get a Kirby Kiss for your trouble. Way too much alcohol to even be considered as ""English"" anything IMO! As it warms the lactose note increases, and I KNOW this is not categorized as a Milk Stout!
Its full mouthfeel and creaminess are both the strength of this beer and its downfall. Nice, but just too much to ever make it really drinkable for me."
Orkney Brewery,The Red MacGregor,,,Scottish Ale,4.0%,bottle,3.90,4,4,4,3,4,1/2/11,"500 mL bottle courtesy of finewinemike as part of the 2010 Secret Santa.
Delighted to get a beer with a sensible ABV for achange, and to be honest this is becoming a rarer and rarer treat. Shame.
Beer pours a fantastic red/tawny port color with a modest head and some sticky lace. With a better head, the beer would be close to perfect in appearance, but out of the bottle a t leas it does not quite deliver. (On draught, I think it may look a bit better).
I was expecting a typical, malty experience and the beer did deliver it, but to be honest it felt a touch on the light side to me. Light caramel and toffee grains interact with the bitterness to produce a beer hat has a LOT of bready character. No problem there, but some depth is missing for me. The beer remains extraordinary drinkable though, and within a few minutes the bottle has disappeared.
Easy drinking, but somehow leaves me wanting a little more malt depth. The brew seems a tad on the light side (and I'm NOT talking about the alcohol) rather there is a mouthfeel that leaves me slightly dissatisfied."
River Horse Brewing Co.,River Horse Belgian Freeze Belgian Style Winter Ale,,,Belgian Dark Ale,8.0%,bottle,2.88,4,3,2.5,3.5,3,1/2/11,"12 oz single, thanks go out to finewinemike as part of my Secret Santa 2010.
Pour is a murky brown, Dubbel like affair with some decent head and some fairly significant lace. In that respect, pretty nice to look at.
Some Belgian yeast notes in the nose and tastes, but also a fair amount of hop character that I wasn't really expecting. The hops, although fairly muted and reserved, still sing out too much for the style for me, and frankly don't belong there, even in the relatively muted manner that they appear. Caramel malts are present but to be honest they get a little overwhelmed in terms of the whole package.
Alcohol is fairly present too, and this comes across as quite strong beer.
A beer that falls a little awkwardly between two stools and as a result fails to deliver properly on either. Needs some work before I would visit this again."
The Bruery,3 French Hens,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,10.0%,bottle,3.93,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,1/2/11,"750 mL capped bottle in the usual ""The Bruery"" presentation.
Now I'm confused. Bought six bottles of this because I was sure I would like it, and after sharing bottle #1 I felt REALLY good about my purchase, however as I drink bottle #2 I feel less confident than I did a few weeks ago.
I had this for the first time about three weeks ago and absolutely loved it. Now I try it for the second time and I feel a little less enamored with it, but above all there seems to be a slight carbonation issue!
The beer pours with a lightly, chill-hazed brown-garnet pour. As I say, on this occasion the beer is poorly carbonated and lacks life. There is a little carbonation at first, but by the time the beer has sat in the glass for about ten minutes, it's completely flat. Disappointing, and not something that I experienced when I drank it three weeks ago.
Nose and tastes deliver plenty of honey, sugared alcohol and some light fruit. Good depth on the Belgian yest and fruit elements and the brew gives some nice fig and plum character. The beer finishes with a dry note that reminds one of the oak element, and a touch more drying ethanol. Aftertaste lingers and reinforces the dry character with some evaporating alcohol.
Definitely some woody, dry fruit in there too.
Interesting beer and I'm a little conflicted here. The carbonation worries me a bit, and it's confusing since I don't recall it being low a couple of weeks ago!?"

Comes with a nicely capped white head, some lace all sitting above a decently colored, garnet/brown, clear body.
The beer drinks true to style with some clean edges and a nice, malty base. Typical Gordon Biersch simplicity with their German based lagers.
The mouthfeel was pretty light and made for some simple, easy drinking,
Tasty beer."
Allagash Brewing Company,Allagash 10th Anniversary Ale,,,Witbier,10.0%,bottle,3.70,3,3,4,3.5,4,12/26/10,"750 mL bottle courtesy of finewinemike in my 2010 Secret Santa package - many thanks Mike. Obviously this beer is quite old, and probably at an age way beyond what the brewer originally intended so the review should be viewed in that context.
Corked & Caged affair that opens with a pretty small pop and a touch of gun smoke. 
The pour is a fairly bright orange color, with a still body an a disappointing lack of carbonation/head/lace. I suppose that given the age of the beer that the carbonation situation should not be that surprising, but nevertheless it's a bit of a shame. The color is especially striking. 
The nose reveals a sugary sweetness and not a lot else. 
The body is a little cleaner than the sweetness in the nose would suggest. No cloying notes (that I was a little concerned about). 
In terms of taste, to be honest the beer isn't as good as I was expecting, but equally it seems a little unfair of me to expect that a beer this old would still perform as well as originally intended. Having said that, at 10% there might be a small degree of expectation that things would have held up OK. Any spices that were there originally have largely disappeared and there is a degree of mild oxidation. With the oxidation comes a very, very light touch of sherry (good), but also of course of touch of cardboard (bad). That's something that you have to live with when you are dealing with older beers.
In the very back end there is some light alcohol notes.
Despite the condition of the beer, it's still tasty and pretty drinkable I just wish that had drunk this beer when it had first come out - my bet is that this was amazing at the outset. One thing to note, age means that this beer drinks nothing like a Witbier now - the degree to which it did originally is unknown to me, so perhaps there has not been much change there at all, or maybe there has been a huge change.
Strangely (or perhaps NOT strangely at ALL) a very similar reaction to this beer as my reaction to Allagash 11th."
Central City Brewing,Red Racer IPA,,,American IPA,6.5%,can,3.95,4,4,4,3.5,4,12/24/10,"Thanks go out to finewinemike for this beer as part of my Secret Santa package for 2010. 
A Canadian born IPA in can, quite the novelty! 
The pour produces a slightly hazed, orange body with lots of white head and some super, sticky lace - always a good sign.
Nose and tastes deliver some very fresh, clean light grapefruit notes, but it's never really aggressive. Finish IS on the dry side of things, but again lacks the puckering aggression that can sometimes come with the style.
Clean, lightly metallic American IPA which will please."
Deschutes Brewery,Jubel 2010,,,American Strong Ale,10.0%,bottle,4.23,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,12/24/10,"22 oz, black waxed affair (as Abyss).
Pour is a superb looking, garnet color with some tremendous clarity. Head is small, leaves little lace but is a pleasing tea hue. Attractive.
Nose has a rich, sugary, molasses light liquor note that is replicated in the taste t a n extent, but the beer feels a little thinner than the nose suggests.
The tastes offer a touch more alcohol than the nose, plus some mild hop character.
This beer reminds me a lot of Fuller's Vintage Ale, except it seems to have a little less body, is a little less rich, has bit more alcohol and more hop notes! Sounds like a lot of differences, but when taken together it DOES remind me of the ""great one"". The beer drinks much more like an English beer (with notes of English Barleywines and English Old Ales).
There's a noticeable vinous character (obviously) from the Pinot Noir, and it builds as the beer warms. The vinous character is warming in the chest too, and it gives a really pleasant overall feel to the beer. 
Jubel 2010 is what I imagine a beer like Stone's Arrogant Bastard would be, if it went to live in England for a couple of years, learned some manners and etiquette and then came back to the USA to show-off it's more refined training! Pretty tasty stuff and delighted to have had the chance to try this beer."
Williams Brothers Brewing Company,Fraoch 20th Anniversary Ale,,,Scottish Gruit / Ancient Herbed Ale,11.0%,bottle,2.55,2.5,3.5,2.5,2,2,12/24/10,"Many thanks go out to my Secret Santa for 2010, finewinemike for the chance to try this beer. This beer has been on my Wants list for quite some time, and having passed on it at least once in the store, I wondered if I would get the chance - many thanks, Mike. Bottled in July of 2009, this is described as being best before 2019.
Expensive looking in as much as the beer comes with a heavy gold foil, a neck label stating that this is bottle #1971 out of 7800 all in a heavy, green glass, 750 mL container. Surprisingly comes with one of those cheap, plastic sparkling wine ""corks"" which somewhat takes the edge off the presentation. Opens with a disappointing lack of carbonation.
The beer pours a pretty lifeless, somewhat drab, murky light brown color with very little head or lace. Nose has a musty, ""old"" note about it with a whiff of liquor.
The tastes are complicated with all kinds of elements pushing their way around. There is a diacetyl butter note, some butterscotch a strange, apple/fruit like acidity, a cheap lemon shandy note and finally some whisky based alcohol. The lemon notes pushes through to the greatest extent in the end, and the beer drinks something like an English lemonade shandy with a dash of whisky added.
It's odd, because frankly I don't like the taste very much at all, but there seems to be an odd draw about it that makes me come back and take another taste, just after I though I couldn't drink any more. However, this sensation does not last to the bottom of the bottle, and ultimately I had to dispose of it.
This was a disappointment frankly. Under=carbonated, and a beer that didn't look attractive and was WAY too busy to really get a handle on. Perhaps in very small quantities, and warmed?? I don't know what lead me to think that, but it struck me that warmed on a stove, this might work well."
Baird Brewing Company / Fishmarket Taproom,Jubilation Ale,,,Winter Warmer,7.0%,on-tap,4.08,3,3.5,4.5,4,4,12/22/10,"22 oz bottle, $10.99 from Arbor Place Beverage, Douglasville, GA, USA.
Pour is a murky brown body with average head and lace. Not that enamored with the color or the appearance and it has me a little unhappy.
On to the nose and taste. It actually drinks in a much cleaner than the color and bod would suggest. The light fruit touch and the cleanliness are traits that I have (happily) begun to associate with Baird, and they are attributes that I enjoy. the nose has a lightly spiced alcohol note, neither of which are truly enforced in the taste. The tastes impart a fruit note (which I suppose are the figs) but frankly could be an orange, citrus based flavor as well. The cinnamon is really muted, and again could really be any, light, winter spice. Frankly it tastes better than it smells and a LOT better than it looks.
Pretty simple, Winter Warmer type of beer, and one that you would probably enjoy if you like the spice note to be a little more muted and less aggressive. Emphasis here is on a light fruit angle, which as I say above, seems to be angle that Baird takes quite a bit and one which I enjoy.
Not a classic Winter Warmer, but a lighter, fruitier version. One downside is the $10.99 price tag. Just a little too expensive to make it good value, although the beer itself is very nice."
Gordon Biersch Brewery Restaurant,Gordon Biersch Winter Bock,,,Doppelbock,7.5%,bottle,3.70,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,12/21/10,"I think that in general, GB beers receive less than a fair shake, and I find many of their German based lagers tasty, brewed close to style and generally worthy.
12 oz single from Total Wine at Perimeter, Atlanta, GA, USA.
A great depth of garnet color on the pour, coupled with super clarity and a decent head, the beer looks really nice in the glass.
Nose gives some really good, alcohol soaked malts with a brief promise of some toasty warmth.
The beer delivers a taste that is a bit drier and more bitter than the nose (and indeed the style) would suggest. It delivers the aggression that one would expect from a Doppelbock, but doesn't quite punch with the sweet blows that one might expect. Extremely bready beer with lots of yeasty tastes.
The beer finishes with a drier and less sweet ending that I would like.
Strange one this, it has some characteristics that one would obviously associate with the style, but then again it seems to lack the classic sweetness."
Mad River Brewing Company,Double Dread Imperial Red Ale,,,American Amber / Red Ale,8.6%,bottle,2.28,3,2,2.5,2,2,12/21/10,"12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Gusher from the bottle that leads to an ugly pour. Murky reddish brown with large specks of yeast floaties in huge quantities. This beer is obviously struggling through either an excess of bottle-conditioning, the lack of filtration or some other final stage issues.
Given the amount of foam that gushes from the bottle, the head and lace a woefully disappointing.
Nose and tastes give an overly aggressive bitter, hop note that tastes like an American Barleywine or DIPA gone wrong. It tastes something like an Arrogant Bastard clone that was made by a poorly skilled homebrewer. Odd aftertaste too. Odd mouthfeel comes with the excessive carbonation of the body.
This may be my first beer from Mad River and it's a very poor introduction. Lack of balance, huge, nondescript poorly managed flavors, and the suspicion of some kind of inability to package the beer correctly. Off-flavors of hop soaked cardboard as well.
Nasty."
Tyranena Brewing Company,Stone Tepee Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),5.8%,bottle,3.60,4,2,4,4,4,12/21/10,"12 oz bottle, usual stubbie presentation from Tyranena, thanks go out to Kevin for a chance to crack this one.
Honey orange color on the pour with a pleasing white head. The beer is capped with a frothy layer of thick bubbles and the head provides some nice, inviting lace.
Nose seems very weak and has me worried. It seems as though this beer has potential to be extremely light on flavor if the nose ids anything to go by.
I need not have worried. The tastes provide a really quite aggressive, fresh hop explosion. This is surprising for two reasons. First the nose did not give any of this away at all, and secondly it's not the kind of bitterness and depth of flavor that one usually associates with the style. Some fruit notes underpin the hoppy blast and beer comes together to give a very satisfying experience. Some soap notes amongst the hops as well. The toasty, pale grains support the beer nicely, and to be frank I'm pretty impressed.
More depth of character and flavor than one is used to with the style, so in that respect and exciting beer to drink. Good stuff."
Tyranena Brewing Company,Rocky's Revenge Bourbon Brown,,,American Brown Ale,6.0%,bottle,3.45,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,12/21/10,"12 oz bottle, usual stubbie presentation from Tyranena, thanks go out to Kevin for a chance to crack this one.
Fairly innocuous looking, mid-brown pour with some creamy head but not much lace.
Nose and taste reveal quite a lot of the bourbon character, in fact a bit more than I was expecting. I'm not a huge fan of bourbon aged beers, but an American Brown Ale does at least seem like a sensible place to put such a thing, and this works fairly well. The bourbon notes are not exactly strong, but they do make a fairly steady appearance all the way through the drink. They also have the effect of tempering any overtly hoppy note that the American versions of brown ales tend to give. For me that's a really good thing, since the last thing I want in a creamy, smooth brown ale is a bunch of in your face hops. As much as I'm not keen on bourbon in my beer, if we are talking about a brown ale then it is a preferable flavor than a bunch of aggressive bitterness.
Smooth with a few other liquor (rum) tastes too, I like this a little more than I thought I might. It does feel a little thin to me, and that seems to be the one ""faulty"" area.
Having said all of that, I bet if you enjoy bourbon aged beers then this beer is one that you will enjoy."
Tyranena Brewing Company,Chief BlackHawk Porter,,,American Porter,5.6%,bottle,3.25,3.5,3,3.5,3,3,12/21/10,"12 oz bottle, usual stubbie presentation from Tyranena, thanks go out to Kevin for a chance to crack this one.
Surprisingly black pour with little or no brown elements that one often sees with porters. Head and lace are frankly both a little disappointing even if they are a nice mocha color.
The nose reveals a touch of coffee but not any bitterness or hop character to speak of. I like my porters, mild, smooth and creamy and although Blackhawk hits to some degree on each of these attributes, ultimately I feel it misses the boat slightly. Some very mild char and a touch of acidity or sourness that one might attribute more to a stout.
Some more light, bitter coffee grinds in the finish, but otherwise a somewhat ""ordinary"" experience. Perhaps fresh, closer to the source and on tap I might like this more, but for now it's a beer that i could frankly take or leave."
New Belgium Brewing,Lips Of Faith Vrienden (Allagash Collaboration),,,American Wild Ale,8.5%,bottle,4.10,4,4,4,4,4.5,12/20/10,"22 oz bottle in the usual Lips of Faith presentation.
Pour is a good looking, light, bright copper hue with some sticky, complex lace. Head is small and leaves just a ring around the extremities of the beer. Clarity is excellent, carbonation medium.
Essentially, if you've ever had an English, west country cider you will have had an experience mightily similar to this.
Nose and tastes reveal some fairly straightforward and simple light apple and cherry acidity that offer a pretty gentle introduction to a touch of light Brett and funk. the nose suggest a little more acidity than the taste ultimately delivers. Acidity is low, but present enough to let you know that you are drinking something that is a bit different. The apple and cherry notes become more fruity s the beer warms and the drinkability is high. 
The beer has a very refreshing, light touch and in that respect reminds me a little of a cider like Strongbow. Slightly less aggressive than that drink, and perhaps lower carbonation and hence a bit smoother.
Simple and that's its beauty. A great way to introduce a new, but LIGHT acid/sour/brett/funk experience to those with little or no knowledge of such things that will break them in gently without too much aggression."
Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,Namaste,,,Witbier,5.0%,bottle,3.90,4,3.5,4,4,4,12/19/10,"Many thanks go out to finewinemike for a chance to try this beer. Came as part of my Secret Santa for 2010.
I guess that this is a somewhat atypical Dogfish Head beer in as much as it is somewhat typical for the style! Nothing really very outlandish here at all, all quite ""normal"".
A honey body sits underneath a tight, fine, dense white head. Nice lace.
The nose and tastes are very floral with the emphasis on the lemongrass rather than the orange peel or coriander. The body and mouthfeel are both very full and smooth and quite surprisingly so as the style can sometimes be a little light. Sensible ABV for a change, too.
I don't know how much this cost, so the value is a bit lost on me, but it's very nice, lemongrass based Wit that will delight those that enjoy the style."
Minhas Craft Brewery,Minhas Swiss Style Amber,,,American Amber / Red Ale,?,bottle,2.35,3,3,2,2,2.5,12/19/10,"12 oz single, mnay thanks go out to Kevin for the chance to try this beer.
Not sure what a ""Swiss Amber"" really is, but I'll try anything once!
Pour is a light, orange, maber body with below average head and lace. Nothing much to report.
The beer is essentially a Vienna Lager in terms of the way it drinks. Sweet, malty, pretty much no hop character and a watery mouthfeel. The dry element is just about the only way that it resembles the style, and if you are looking for any type of significant hop-based experience, forget it.
The thin mouthfeel is accompanied by a cardboard taste. Pretty poor."
Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Co.,Burger Classic,,,American Adjunct Lager,?,can,3.33,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,12/18/10,"12 oz can courtesy of Kevin - thanks again!
Orangey, yellow pour with some pretty fierce carbonation. The head that forms initially is very high, fluffy and white. It fades quickly though to give nothing more than a tiny film on the surface of the beer and one or two wisps of lace.
Little to report here other than a pretty sweet, thin beer that to be honest I don't mind too much. It has a lemony aroma but not much of that is transferred to the taste. Some acidity and fairly drinkable given the style circumstances.
The pale malts are the feature here and they support the beer quite well. Not devoid of taste and the can is a bonus."
Terrapin Beer Company,Terrapin Big Daddy Vlady's Russian Imperial Stout,,,Russian Imperial Stout,10.3%,bottle,2.25,4,3,2,2.5,1.5,12/16/10,"22 oz bottle in the usual Side Project presentation, this is #13.
$7.49 for the bottle. The latest in the deluge of beer that is coming out of Terrapin these days (with mixed results I might add).
Standard jet black pour with a smallish head. There is a distinct lack of body. The beer really is quite thin.
The beer pulls together an odd combination of attributes. It's quite sweet but it brings a terribly unrelenting solvent alcohol presence. The roasty sweetness that IS there and threatens to be a nice taste that the beer COULD hand its hat on, is once again overwhelmed by the rubbing alcohol/methylated spirits and paint thinner keep on coming through over and over again. Horrible, nasty burn that results in a drain pour for the second half of the bottle.
Oddly, the solvents are not so noticeable in the nose.
This really isn't very good. It feels unfinished and is no more than an solvent alcohol bomb. Not good."
Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),LongShot Old Ben Ale,,,Old Ale,9.0%,bottle,3.68,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,12/12/10,"12 oz single from the Longshot pack.
A nice looking pour that gives a simple, brown, clear beer with some pretty good carbonation considering the ABV. Head and lace are both adequate and better than I anticipated.
This beer is nowhere near as intense as I was expecting, which may be due to the age of the beer. It has probably calmed down a bit since it was first bottled.
Nose and tastes are pretty straightforward. Light alcohol amongst the sweet sugars (brown) and some simple raisin like notes. The beer is a bit drier and a bit less aggressive than I was expecting though. Not overly sweet, and quite muted in several areas.
Very easy drinking, and surprisingly mellow."
Hoppin' Frog Brewery,Frosted Frog Christmas Ale,,,Winter Warmer,8.6%,bottle,3.70,3.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,12/12/10,"22 oz bottle from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
The pour is a very attractive garnet colored pour with a smallish head that eventually forms a light, mocha colored spotty film on the surface of the beer. No lace to speak of.
The nose delivers a HUGE blast of cinnamon. Not subtle, not restrained and a little off-putting.
The tastes follow suit with some large cardamon, cinnamon and ginger elements all present. Underneath it all there are some caramel malts, but the spices are extremely dominant and also add a bit of herbal quality as well. There isn't much here outside of the spices but I'm not sure that they were trying to do much else. Alcohol well hidden.
This strikes me as a mood beer. If you are in the festive mood and want to indulge in a beer that reflects spicy, winter warmer type scene, then you would probably go for this. Outside of that context this could become a bit of an effort and you could tire of it very quickly indeed."
Sprecher Brewing Company,Pipers Scotch-Style Ale,,,Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy,8.3%,bottle,4.23,4,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,12/12/10,"12 oz, single stubbie in the usual, Sprecher presentation. Beer courtesy of Kevin - many thanks.
Pour provides a reddish, brown hue with some really nice head and lace. The head is pretty thick and produces a lot of sticky residue.
Nose and tastes deliver a LOT of peat! A very smoky experience indeed, and not one that I was expecting. Having said that it does grow on me as I consume the beer, but it's a bit of a shock at first. I would call it bracing!
Obviously amongst the smoke and peat is a beer that is simply malt based with some caramel undertones with the sweetness. Very tasty and packed full of flavor.
Sprecher make some really fantastic beer on the malt end of the spectrum and this is no exception. Certainly pushing the peat notes to the absolute maximum for me, the beer is not quite as drinkable as I would like (because of the peat), but still maintains a high level of quality."
Stone Brewing Co.,Lukcy Basartd Ale,,,American Strong Ale,8.5%,bottle,3.45,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,12/12/10,"22 oz bottle from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Magnificent clarity on the garnet pour with a head that is initially good but fades quite quickly. A little lace. The color is very attractive.
There's a big, 'ole piney West Coast nose upfront with this one. Quite herbal too.
Tastes are largely as expected with drying hops, aggressive bitterness and some hot alcohol, but this beer lacks the richness and complete, malt intensity that the other Bastards do. It feels like Arrogant Lite, and the mouthfeel matches the lighter feel. The lack of malt depth is what really distinguishes this beer from the other, similar beers that Stone brews. It has a strange, floral or herbal note that is a little off-putting. Quite surprised at how the hops seem to add pine and green herbal notes rather than straight up bitterness.
Not a beer I care for much, and given the excellence of Arrogant Bastard this is a beer that is difficult to purchase when the others are out there. One and done here."
"Inveralmond Brewery Ltd., The",Santa's Swallie,,,Scottish Ale,4.3%,bottle,4.33,4.5,4.5,4,4,5,12/11/10,"500 mL bottle from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour delivers a classic, English Pale Ale appearance with a slightly clouded, light amber hue with a spotty head that produces some nice retention and some sticky lace. All is well with the appearance.
Nose offers some lovely malt notes that have depth, plus a pronounced, buttery, toasty aroma. Nice.
Tastes reflect the nose and also bring a slight, light-rum character. NOT boozy, but it does have some raisin and bready notes. Short finish which is quite dry for the the level of malts that are present and defies the origin of the beer. Any sice notes (nutmeg and cinnamon are mentioned on the label) are extremely subtle, and that's one of the strengths here.
For intents and purposes this drinks like an English Pale Ale, and if you are anticipating a Scotch Ale or a Winter Warmer, forget it. Simple biscuit malts with hop character that adds a degree of unexpected bitterness is the real element here, and it tastes very good. Subtle, refined and gentle, many will miss the charm and sophistication of this beer."
Jailhouse Brewing Company,Slammer Wheat,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,5.0%,bottle,4.25,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,12/11/10,"22 oz bottle from Hop City, GA, USA.
Nice presentation, I like the artwork, and having been to the brewery it certain is in keeping with the branding that they are looking for.
I first tasted this beer way back in February or march of this year when I visited the brewery. I thoroughly enjoyed it then, so i was delighted to see that the bottles had finally made it out a couple of weeks ago - good stuff.
A honey colored, orange pour with nice cloudiness, a decent yeast sediment that makes its way into the Tucher Weizen 0.5 L glass and produces a light, non-dense head with a touch of lace.
The nose offers some sharp, fruity acidity and this is what we find in the initial tastes, too. Light citrus notes are the main feature here. A higher hop profile that perhaps is usual for the style, and all in all this beer has a MUCH deeper presence and depth than is usual for the style. Impressively brewed, Slammer Wheat seems to go well beyond the parameters of the style and to a heavier ""more present"" mouthfeel. A few soapy notes that become quite a feature of the taste.
Definitely a beer that packs a good punch and fights well above its own style-weight. tasty, drinkable and a welcome addition to the local scene."
Moa Brewing Company,Moa Noir,,,Euro Dark Lager,5.5%,bottle,3.55,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,12/11/10,"Hazy, reddish-brown pour with a small one finger head and very little lace or retention.
Nose and tastes are simple and slightly nutty. In that respect the first impression of this beer are much more in the brown ale area of things rather than as a dark lager. As things progress (warm), the beer does take on some cleaner and more bitter edges and the malt sweetness fades somewhat.
There is no doubt that there is a degree of bakers chocolate in the tastes in addition to a touch of cocoa. A pretty dry beer considering the malt content. Chocolate actual builds quite a bit over the course of the bottle
Quite full in the mouth, the beer is very smooth and leaves a slight coating on the tongue and teeth.
Mildly interesting distraction but not one that I would seek out again."
Gordash Brewing Company,Panic Attack,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,10.0%,bottle,3.65,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,12/10/10,"12 oz single, Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
When a beer has the generic words, ""Belgian Style Ale"" on the label it makes me nervous. When it's from the Holy Mackerel stable as well, it makes me even more wary, and to be honest I do not have high hopes for this beer before I open it.
A copper hue with a decent amount of lace and some creamy head that sits on top of the brew,
Firstly this is NOT, by any stretch of the imagination a beer that should be categorized as a Belgian Strong Dark. It fails to fit that category on a whole bunch of levels. For all intents and purposes this is a, ""slightly darker than normal"", Tripel.
The nose and tastes deliver most of the classic Tripel elements; a viscous body, plenty of sweetness, some fruit esters (pineapple) and a BIG dose of alcohol. In the back end there is a really interesting blast of herbal, juniper tastes and some bubble gum. The Tripel notes are backed up with some white pepper in the finish. A touch of honey in the sweetness and a little caramel and banana round things out. The bubblegum notes that come with some Tripels are subdued.
It's all there for a Tripel (with the exception of a light copper color rather than a bright, golden one) but ""Tripel"" is the benchmark that will tell you where this beer is coming from and how it drinks.
Quite tasty, and much more enjoyable than I was expecting, but this is a beer that you will want to drink in small quantities!"
"August Schell Brewing Co., Inc.",FireBrick,,,Vienna Lager,5.0%,bottle,2.75,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,3,12/9/10,"12 oz bottle, thanks go out to Kevin for the chance to try this.
A mid-amber, cloudy pour with a thin head that produces some attractive if somewhat thin lace. The lace is a little watery, but is quite intricate. 
Bready, malt based combo of nose and tastes lead one into a fairly authentic Vienna lager taste. Pretty light in the mouth which may seem like a good thing, but to be honest it feels a bit thin and watery. More bread and sweetness in the back end and finish. Carbonation is pretty lively and introduces a little prickle. Amongst it all is a touch of fruit, but not much.
OK but heaps of better examples of the style out there, and as a result I'd pass."
Dave's BrewFarm,BrewFarm Select,,,American Pale Lager,5.5%,can,3.18,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,12/9/10,"12 oz can, many thanks to Kevin for the opportunity to try this one.
Golden, clear, macro-like pour with a decent, fluffy head. Some retention and some attractive lace but otherwise largely unremarkable.
Grainy, buttered toast on the nose with some slight grassy hop aroma - not much at all, even on warming.
Tastes offer an organic-like experience with a clean bill of malts making up the majority of the tastes. Some more light hay and grass but it never really adds up to much. Not much depth here, and I suppose that's OK, but the beer ultimately remains pretty ordinary. ""Sweet"" and ""clean"" are attributes in its favor, but not much else is. Good beer for some outdoor drinking in warmer weather I suppose.
Fine, but ultimately another beer in a unremarkable category."
Wild Heaven Craft Beers,Ode To Mercy,,,American Brown Ale,8.2%,on-tap,3.00,4,4,3,2.5,2,12/7/10,"On-tap at Taco Mac in Douglasville, GA, USA.
Pour is a good looking, dark brown color with some nice clarity. Carbonation is relatively low which seems appropriate. Small head with some spotty film on the surface and a little lace. A little thin.
I read a couple of reviews of this beer which described a coffee note to the beer which to be honest I took with a pinch of salt. ""Coffee"" taste is one of those default, fallback tastes that I think people sometimes imagine in Stouts and Porters and other ""dark"" beers, and in a Brown Ale it seemed a little unlikely; in reality it was spot on!
Quite a lot of coffee in the nose and also in the initial tastes. The coffee settles down a bit and the beer goes into ""Brown Ale mode"" with a little nuttiness and some deeper malts. All of that is fine and dandy and it's quite nice, but the problem here is the alcohol. It seems to bump heads with the relatively subtle style, and with the mouthfeel being quite thin, it takes on a solvent aggression that grates on me very quickly. 
I suppose that Imperial Brown Ales are OK, but to me it gets tedious and drinking is not easy. This beer lacks the depth to hold up so much alcohol and in the end it gets quite solvent-like.
A potentially tasty profile spoiled by too much alcohol."
New Belgium Brewing,Lips Of Faith Sahti,,,Sahti,7.2%,bottle,4.23,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,12/6/10,"22 oz bottle.
Pour is a very, very good looking golden orange body with a wispy, thinnish head. Not much retention, some lace.
Nose has plenty of sweet malts and perhaps a whiff of solvent like alcohol. Not very well defined as far as I could make out.
Tastes are built around that of a malty, relatively high gravity lager with some lemongrass notes. There is little or no juniper character, and the beer reminds me a bit of a watery Maibock. It really doesn't have a lot of body but in one way that makes it more drinkable. The alcohol seems to build over the length of the beer, or at least the alcohol TASTE, builds. There is a little bitterness in the far back end but it is pretty minute.
The bottle mentions the lemon peel, but it also says the beer is ""hazy"" which under absolutely NO circumstances is it.
Interesting beer that is drinkable, pretty light and a beer that appeals to my malty side and the fact I like a beer with good clarity and color."
Left Hand Brewing Company,Fade To Black Volume 1 - Foreign Export Stout,,,Foreign / Export Stout,8.5%,bottle,3.75,4.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,12/2/10,"12 oz single.
Been holding on to this one since the original release. Time to have a crack at it now.
Pour is an impressive jet black body with a tight head of very fine bubbles. Nice looking head and decent retention and lace.
Nose releases some bready malts and not a lot else.
Tastes release some very light alcohol notes amongst the very lightly charred, dark chocolate. A little bitterness that is the source of the slightly dry character. The dryness doesn't really ever get very high, which I suppose keeps it out of the Irish/Dry Stout category. A light, metallic bitterness lingers for a while on the palate as well.
Th body achieves the unusual, but welcome, combination of being pretty light but also creamy. Unusual to get hat combo pulled off. 
Alcohol pretty well hidden to be honest.
Extremely drinkable, in part because of the relative lightness of the body, but either way it goes down very easily."
Founders Brewing Company,Founders Nemesis 2010,,,American Barleywine,12.0%,bottle,2.50,4,4,2,2,2,12/1/10,"12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Meh, when beer gets like this for me it essentially ceases to become beer and turns into an experience that is simply too much like hard work. You have to really work at this beer to appreciate it and drink it, and for me that begins to detract from the point of ""having a beer"".
It's a VERY high octane product no matter how one looks at it, and a beer like this could ONLY be brewed in America, or least by a brewer with a colossal American influence.
Pour is an attractive, reddish brown highlighted black, with a decent mocha head and a little lace and retention. The head has a coffee color to it.
The initial aromas are really quite sweet, and offer a boozy malt bomb that put s one in mind of an English Barleywine. When one considers the appearance and nose, all is well. The tastes are a different matter though.
What starts off as a reflection on the nose (sugary sweetness, lots of malts and plenty of booze), about half way through a vicious bitterness, led by unrelenting citrus and pine-needle base based hops, cuts right across the palate. It ends up being a puckeringly dry, charcoal based nastiness that coats the tongue and not in a good way. Some wood, some drying sawdust and a everlasting bitterness that dries the tongue and palate for scores of minutes after the beer is finished. Alcohol arrives in a loud shirt and wears its sunglasses indoors. Hot and unsophisticated in the extreme.
Rough around he edges, this beer screams aggression and frankly has all the hallmarks of beer that is trying to be a noisy, brash, uninvited party goer without much class.
Horrible finish and aftertaste, takes the beer from a smooth start to an almost unrecognizable ending. Impossible to drink more than maybe 18-10 of the 12 oz, this beer also represents absolutely APPALLING value. All that's bad about contemporary, American craft beer."
"Peak Organic Brewing Company, LLC",Maple Oat Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),5.2%,bottle,4.20,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,12/1/10,"12 oz single from Hop City a few weeks ago.
Pour is a hazy, honey colored amber with a fluffy white head and some persistent lace.
Aroma is pretty sweet with plenty of maple syrup notes, some more honey and brown sugar.
All of these aroma characters come together in the taste to produce a real, sugar sweet, malt bomb. Finish offers a little hop bite, but it's generally lost amongst the sweetness. Aftertaste lingers a little.
Mouthfeel is pretty rich and reflects the sugar nature of the beer. Quite full and a little viscous.
Very tasty with the honey like elements but you're going to need to enjoy a sweet beer to make much sense of this."
Cigar City Brewing,Marshal Zhukov's Imperial Stout,,,Russian Imperial Stout,11.5%,bottle,3.90,4,3.5,4,4,4,11/27/10,"750 mL bottle from Total Wine in Jacksonville, FL.
OK, small hiss/fizz as the cap is prized off, in a moment you'll see why that detail is relevant.
Pour gives a rich looking, thick, jet-black body with a few very dark brown highlights at the edges. The beer leaves some very impressive, tobacco colored film/oil on the inside of the glass like alcohol legs that cover the whole surface of the vessel. Impressive. ZERO head. ZERO lace.
Nose gives a really sweet, alcohol based aroma with some serious chocolate and malt notes. There is also a little smoke (see more later).
The tastes reflect the nose and are very rich and sweet. The chocolate, alcohol based notes are defined by their extravagance and richness, but they also come with a smokiness and a little acidity. Sweetness upfront and some charred notes in the back end.
Here's the rub - ZERO and I mean ZERO carbonation. Not just a beer with relatively low carbonation that we would expect, but basically a completely flat experience - like milk. In fact, the beer kind of reminds me of an alcohol laced, dark chocolate milkshake. Flat.
The aftertaste leaves a little coffee-grind bitterness which also has a slightly charred, charcoal based molasses.
I have a feeling that this bottle has somehow become ""uncarbonated"". Seems unlikely, but there really is no other explanation. There was a very small hiss as the beer opened but the lack of ANY CO2 seems odd. I couldn't even generate any head with a massively aggressive pour. Despite the lack of carbonation the beer still feels slick and rich in the mouth and is in no way thin.

Typical Pils appearance with a light golden body and a wispy head. the head lacks much presence for me.
The nose and tastes are in the right ballpark, but a re a little too sweet for my liking when I consider the style. I like my Pils to have a really strong Noble/Saaz bite especially in the finish, and although this beer delivers some of that, it doesn't really come through strong., there are quite a few residual sugars there which conflict a little with the bitterness that I am seeking.
Simple and drinkable with a little hop, soapy character which is good, but the beer lacks in in your face bitter punch in the finish and ultimately just feels too sweet for me. I need more soap and a lot more brutality in the ending.
Not bad, but a long way from the best GL brew."

Pour is a well carbonated, totally clear light straw color with a huge, fluffy and sticky head. Lace is pretty good too. Color is a little light, but otherwise looks pretty good.
Nice carbonation leads to a lively mouthfeel.
Nose is a little corny and vegetal to be honest, and does not inspire much confidence.
The tastes are citrusy. Some lemongrass but it is quite watery. The back-end and finish are very short, but it is clean with almost zero aftertaste. More slight, shandy-like lemon tastes fall into place.
Drinkability and thirst quenching notes are high, but outside of that the beer lacks much depth. It's really VERY light, and in that respect perhaps a good beer to introduce the BMC crowd to a new brewer."
Innis & Gunn,Rum Cask Oak Aged Beer,,,Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy,7.4%,bottle,4.35,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,11/26/10,"11.2 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA. recently in four packs in Atlanta.
Clear bottle presentation with the blue accents makes a very attractive proposition.
The color of this beer is truly a sight to behold. Beautiful clarity on the pour and a copper/red/burgandy body sits underneath a white head. Some lace and a fine film forms on the surface of the shimmering body.
Nose is surprisingly muted to be honest. Even on warming the liquor aspect is not strong to me (although it is certainly there), rather we get a slightly acidic, apple based note.
Similarly the tastes are not quite a huge as I thought that they may be. For some that may seem problematic, but for me it's the contrary. This really is quite a subtle beer, and had this been inspired elsewhere, the rum notes could have been overwhelming. As it is, it's pretty light. Sweet, mellow and surprisingly light and drinkable, the beer actually screams subtlety which is not how it could have turned out. Low carbonation which works well, and the dryish rum notes build over the glass, but ultimately still work swell with only a slight warming alcohol effect. For me the oak character is really pretty reserved and light.
Very enjoyable and it has a drinkability that is much higher than I was anticipating. Tasty and easy drinking."
Southern Tier Brewing Company,Old Man (Winter Ale),,,Old Ale,7.2%,on-tap,4.00,4,4,4,4,4,11/26/10,"This is NOT an Old Ale in my book. I was actually expecting it to be labeled as a Winter Warmer, but it drinks more like an American IPA.
On tap at The Irish Bred Pub in Douglasville, GA, USA.
Great looking pour with the deep copper, mahogany body showing superb clarity underneath a bone-white head. Head is not terribly well maintained, but there is some decent lacing.
Nose gives up some fresh, raw hops.
The beer is much hoppier than I was expecting and this is the abiding memory. Some good levels of bitterness that makes the beer drink like a freshly hopped, American IPA. Some citrus notes and pretty, green and fresh feel about the beer. Malts are present in quantities that hold the whole thing together nicely. Alcohol is well hidden and beer drinks lower than the ABV would suggest it might.
Not exactly what I expected, but at the same time I was pleasantly surprised and found the beer both refreshing and moreish.
Good stuff, better than expected."
Harpoon Brewery,Harpoon Leviathan - Triticus,,,Wheatwine,11.5%,bottle,4.40,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,11/25/10,"12 oz bottle , courtesy of shogokawada.
Pour is a very rich looking, black color but does not have too much viscosity. Thin, creamy film forms on the surface of the beer.
Initial tastes give some nice chocolate malts and a healthy does of booze. These are the main competing/complementing factors. As the beer warms we get more and more liquor and sherry notes and the brew really starts to come into its own. As expected the nose starts to develop with warmth, too; a malt bomb laced with somewhat menacing alcohol.
Although the alcohol based malt is the obvious main factor here, there is a jarring hop bitterness that never leaves. It lingers, and makes itself especially known in the finish. Still, the beer is definitely sweet and nicely balanced considering the massive nature of many of the elements.
This beer remains a brooding, latently aggressive beer but also has style and presence.
A truly great beer when I tasted the original many years ago, and this maintains much of those characteristics. Strong and bold, this is not for the feint of heart."
Pretty Things Beer & Ale Project,Hedgerow Bitter,,,English Pale Ale,5.4%,bottle,3.20,3,3.5,3,4,3,11/25/10,"22 oz bottle, thanks go out to Shogokawada for the chance to try this. Bottled Aug 2010, 1st Batch.
Pour is a pretty light amber color with plenty of orange color. Quite hazed. A little head, a tiny bit of lace but not much retention. It looks a bit muddy.
The nose does not give way to any hop character, rather it gives a simple, malt sweetness and not a great deal more.
The tastes are intensely bitter in several areas. The front end is not too intense, but the middle, back end and finish are really quite shrap. It's not subtle at all. Strange really, becasue the beer is held togeher by a decent, biscuit like, English malt framework, but the beer also deviates fairly dramatically from highly hopped version of an English Ale (which is what one might think this would resemble).
The bitterness is obviously the feature here, and that's all well and good, but to me it sits a little awkwardly against the malt bill that it is coupled with. It's just not especially drinkable for me, and it seems as if there are two separate, competing factors. Not bad, just a bit awkward. For me, it gets caught between an English Pale Ale and West Coast hop bomb. Weird."
Trader Joe's Brewing Company,Trader Joe's 2010 Vintage Ale,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,9.2%,bottle,4.48,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,11/25/10,"A release that I look forward to every year for two reasons; the value associated with this beer is generally exceptional, and Unibroue is simply a brewer that rarely misses when it plays in its own, Canadian inspired, ""Belgian"" ballpark.
Corked & Caged 750 mL in the usual Unibroue style bottle, with a blue ""U"" on top of the cap that is reassuring. Best Before date on the rear of the bottle, 09-10-2013. J221 01 953Q dot-matrixed on the shoulder of the bottle at the side.
A very dark brown body which, in less than strong light appears largely just black. Head is a mocha color, that fades fairly quickly to leave a collar and a thin film on the beer.
Nose has some lightly spiced fruit.
The tastes are based on the same light fruit and spice as the nose. The spice builds with warmth and as the bottle is consumed. White pepper is present, alongside a touch of aniseed. Perhaps a dash of pumpkin or cardamon. Some mace and some more obvious nutmeg. Even some carrot cake. Not much alcohol at all, and a nice, slightly lingering bitterness related to orange peel in the back end and finish. A few of the typical Unibroue yeast notes, but it seems a bit more muted than in many of their other beers. The yeast does get a bit bigger as it warms, as does a dash of wintergreen. 
The mouthfeel is lively and makes the beer feel much lighter than it otherwise might be.
Very satisfying, moreish and tasty as usual. Exceptional value. Great stuff."
De Proefbrouwerij (bvba Andelot),Monstre Rouge,,,Flanders Red Ale,8.5%,bottle,1.95,2,2,2,2.5,1.5,11/23/10,"*SHRUG*
I have literally no idea what is going on here. If the attempt was to make a Flanders Red then this is a complete failure. If they wanted to produce a slightly watered down version of a DIPA, then success!
$14.99 (at least), in some locations even more expensive, for the 750 mL (plastic) corked and caged bottle. Cork is very difficult to remove.
Beer pours an ugly, murky brown that looks like tea. Head is initially good, but fades very quickly to give a thin white film on the top of the beer. Watery lace on the side of the glass. 
Nose has some watery hops, and not much else. The beer delivers a watered down hop taste like a bad DIPA homebrew. There is nothing more to this beer, other than a bit of alcohol in the finish. Water herbal notes make up the aftertaste. A bit of dryish, woody oak there too but it also seems like a mistake.
ZERO Flanders Red character and a bad, bad DIPA on top of that.
Since I heard about this collaboration years ago I was excited for this brew. After it came out and I heard that people were disappointed, I thought I would leave it to see if any Flanders Red character developed - it didn't. 
Total write-off and I am amazed that these two breweries allowed this beer to be inflicted on the public. Awful. Drain-poured a fair amount of it.

Word on the street is that this is essentially the same beer as this; http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/864/46125
but the beer has been ""tweaked"" a little in terms of the recipe, and (obviously) it has been re-branded as part of Red Brick's image overhaul.
The pour gives a nice, mahogany body with some light chill haze. The head is tan and light and bubbly. Retention and lace are below average.
WOW! The nose and tastes are ENORMOUS bubble-gum and fruity banana. ""Strong"" is NOT the word, it's an astonishingly powerful, sweet assault. There are some underlying almond notes, but these almonds a sugar coated! We then get a massive array of esters that follow through in the middle and the back end. Pineapple, pears and other tropical fruits are there too. Some alcohol that warms in the chest on the way down. A little slick in the mouth.
The finish is amazingly short considering the early assault, and the beer does not linger in the aftertaste as one may have though after the initial blast. Something to age? This needs to settle down a bit.
There isn't much subtle about this beer, and I suppose that's OK, but this beer will not please anyone who does not like a very sweet, fruity, Belgian style beer. I DO like this kind of beer, but to be honest this thing is really MUCH too over the top even for my, sweet-loving palate. 
The beer is not really like a BSDA at all, and I would favor the description of a fruity Dubbel, either way this is a pretty crazy beer. MUCH aggression in terms of the fruit, I bet lots of people will hat this. I don't, but it's really a borderline beer in all kinds of ways."

No freshness date that I can see.
Nice golden clarity on the pour and a pretty high head. Head fades to leave a small collar and a little lace. Attractive.
Very strong (surprisingly so) sweet malt aroma builds from the moment it is opened. The sweetness carries into the tastes with some light hay, a bit of wet grassiness about it and a small whiff of organic notes. Appropriate, gentle carbonation. there is quite a lot of grain based sweetness here, but I like it. it lacks significant bitterness that might score it lower if we were really considering style, but it's still a tasty beer.
Clean and easy on the palate, and a nice ABV.
Quaffable and a light touch on the beer makes it a good thirst quencher. Obviously not a session beer, but one that could be consumed in fairly large amounts.
Tasty, simple and a decent introduction to this brewer."

VERY excited to try this as I generally love the Kasteel range. You have to like REALLY sweet beers, and I do, so these beers are pretty much right up my street. This should be no exception.
Pour is a mahogany brown with a nice frothy head. Relatively short lived, but still solid. looks nice, has good clarity and is well appointed. Nice.
The aroma is a mixture of some alcohol soaked raisins and a touch of burned malt.
The beer is not as sweet nor as complex as I was expecting. In those regards it lets me down slightly, however it still tastes superb. A little warming alcohol stills on top (and at the back end of) some gentle marzipan and a fruity blast. A touch drier than I was expecting, but the alcohol seems pretty well hidden to me.
A more gentle and subtle beer than I was expecting since it did NOT deliver a massive, sweet assault on the senses but still a superb example of the style. When drinking, the alcohol is a few notches lower than 11.0 % ABV would suggest and comes together nicely, but later I really felt the full force, almost as if the sweetness were hidden, but still came back to give me a headache!"
Cigar City Brewing,Jai Alai IPA,,,American IPA,7.5%,on-tap,4.55,4,4.5,5,4,4,11/20/10,"===
Original Review 11/10
===
Drunk on numerous occasions on a recent trip to Jacksonville, FL, USA. This review is taken from one of the draft servings.
High head sits a top the amber body and leaves some superb, sticky lace.
The aroma and tastes match one another in as much as the beer gives a high fruit element amongst the hops. This is a fruity tasting IPA indeed, BUT it in no way skimps on the hop profile either. It's pretty unusual in the way in manages to combine the two elements that can be competing factors. Light grapefruit, and then a few more tropical, sweeter, softer edges to the fruit.
It's a beer that is somewhat of a paradox. It DOES have the signature aggression in the hop profile for an American IPA, but at the same time it also gives a gentle, softer sweet fruit note that I really enjoy.
It's a REALLY tasty beer but the ABV creeps up on me a bit and I really can't consume much more than 12 oz at a time. the drinkability is good because of the taste, but it's not a beer that can be consumed in any type of quantity."
New Belgium Brewing,Frambozen Raspberry Brown Ale,,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,6.5%,bottle,3.55,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,11/20/10,"12 oz bottle in the usual New Belgium presentation. 20FEB11 is dot-matrixed on the label.
New Belgium has been in the GA market for sometime, but this beer is a relatively new entry. Single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour is a really attractive, dark copper brown with great clarity and a spectacular abundance of bright read highlights. Really great color. Head is initially large but fades quickly to give a little lace and some thin film across the surface of the beer.
Nose offers some light, fruity acidity and not much else.
The beer is pretty much exactly what is says it is going to be on the label; in some ways that is very encouraging. There is a pretty solid, brown ale base that offers some good malts, and on top of that we get the fruity acidity of the raspberry flavor. Both elements (raspberry and brown ale) compete for ones attention in equal degrees. Both are there, and both make an appearance, but to be honest this is also the weakness of the beer. It gets caught between the two and never really makes it as a brown ale OR as a fruit beer.
Lots of fine, reserved carbonation that makes the beer very creamy.
The color (when held up to the light) is the strongest feature, and although I don't DISLIKE it as such, it never really gets to where it needs to be as a Brown Ale or a Fruit beer.
Strange, a beer that limps to nowhere in particular but in a non-offensive manner."
New England Brewing Co.,Atlantic Amber,,,American Amber / Red Ale,5.0%,can,2.85,3.5,3,2.5,3.5,3,11/20/10,"Retired? OK. Very recent purchase from Grassroots, Jacksonville, FL, USA. 12 oz can.
Pour is a somewhat drab drown with lots of chill haze. head is quite dense and rich and leaves a lot of sticky lace. the aroma is pretty neutral even after warming, but there are a few malt whiffs from the glass.
Caramel and light toffee notes make up the majority of the flavor profile and the beer is rather sweet. A little damp cardboard too.
Not very impressive beer and the retired factor in the BA db has me wondering how old this is. The beer seems a bit musty which is a sign of older product, but with no freshness date on the can that I can see, the review stands."
Tommyknocker Brewery,Legend,,,American Strong Ale,10.0%,bottle,4.00,3,4.5,4,3.5,4,11/20/10,"$9.68 from Euro Street Market in Jacksonville Beach, FL.
The red wax on the bottle is extremely thick and a big pain in the ass to get through. 2009 vintage with the date embossed in the wax as per a seal.
The pour is pretty much un-carbonated and yields a murky, dirty brown body. Not attractive and little or no head.
Nose has an enormous amount of oak and associated liquor notes. Very good aroma. 
Tastes reflect the nose and there are a lot of residual sugars, sherry notes and some warming alcohol. Nothing that surprising, but we do get a somewhat unusual, cocoa, bakers chocolate, dry finish which is not what I was expecting. It's not really in line with the type of beer this is, but it does take the edge off the alcohol and in a strange way makes the beer more drinkable that it otherwise might be. Maple isn't really there at all.
As it warms the oak gets bigger and bigger and bigger, but the alcohol does not build much and the dry finish never lets up. A touch of tannin like bitterness at he very back end.
Body is pretty dead, but to be honest that is somewhat expected. Not full of life!
Interesting as the beer gives massive oak but also has a few elements (dry finish and light alcohol) that I would next expect."
Anchor Brewing Company,Our Special Ale 2010 (Anchor Christmas Ale),,,Winter Warmer,5.5%,bottle,3.98,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,11/19/10,"12 oz single from my annual sixer. Usual presentation 
The usual, dark walnut brown pour with plenty of quite rich looking head. Some good looking lace as usual and the beer looks its usual, rich color.
All of the expected and normal herbal, lightly spiced notes with the emphasis on some more bitterness than in the past. Some really light licorice but a beer that seems to have less influence on the fruity side of things. A little bit of sweet and sour on the back end.
Mouthfeel does not seem quite as rich as it has in the past either, but of course this whole thing is somewhat based upon memory when thinking about comparing years.
Not much to report here. Simply a beer that I enjoy a few bottles of at this time of year and will lay a couple down to continue to build a vertical of sorts."
New England Brewing Co.,Elm City Lager,,,German Pilsener,5.0%,can,3.65,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,11/19/10,"12 oz can from Grassroots in Jacksonville, GA, USA.
The beer has a somewhat disturbingly, pale color and in terms of the hue looks a bit weak. Paradoxically, the head is resplendent - high, fluffy and full of sticky lace, it looks really good. Admittedly it is not really a classic looking Pilsner, nor is the head typical of the style but it looks OK.
Carbonation is quite high too.
This is a very, very sweet beer that I actually like. It does NOT deliver a classic, Noble or Saaz bite (which I would want if I was concerned about style), but it is very drinkable.
Having said all of that it seems like it is closer to a macro, adjunct lager than a classic Pils, but it does have some kind of strange appeal. Perhaps the can helps, I don't know, but I bet this beer will not impress some folk. Although I like it, I would understand why other people didn't fancy it much."
Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,30th Anniversary - Grand Cru,,,American Strong Ale,9.2%,bottle,3.85,5,4,4,3,3.5,11/18/10,"750 mL with a tight cork and cage. BIG pop on opening - take care!
The beer really does look magnificent in the DFH signature glass. There is a deep, garnet color with some super clarity, and a remarkable, high head with good lace. The head is both creamy and rocky and has an of-white color that is truly impressive.
OK, I have to admit that I was hoping that this was going to be a Belgian Dark of some description (given the Grand Cru moniker), but of course there is no reason why that should be the case, nor should I expect something like that from SN but a man can dream, can't he? Actually I got over that ""disappointment"" fairly quickly.
The nose and tastes have a lot of pretty clean, fresh, green, wet hop notes and a decent does of alcohol. To me this beer isn't really an American Strong at all (it doesn't seem to have the malt presence. The hop bitterness build and to be honest I feel as though this beer drinks much more like a west coast DIPA than anything else.
Lots of metallic green hops on the back end and the aftertastes. It's also pretty light in the mouth and doesn't offer much depth of body. That might be considered a good thing, but it's out of sync with the ABV for me.
Not a beer for me, and I think it has style issues (it seems more like a fresh hop ale to me) but there is NO doubt that it carries the SN trademarks. I suppose that can be both good and bad depending on your perspective and angle."
Mikkeller,Til Fra (To From),,,Baltic Porter,8.0%,bottle,4.03,4.5,4,4,4,4,11/14/10,"Opening this today (11/14/10) to commemorate week #300 of NBS. This is a bottle that I received as part of my 2007 Secret Santa package from BA nlmartin over three years ago. Seems like a good moment, occasion and decision to crack this one now. Price tag says it came from ""Dilly Deli"".
750 mL bottle with gold foil on the neck, a plastic ""cork"" and cage. Small pop on opening. Undated as far as I can see, but as I say this was given to me in 2007.
Jet black body with a few reddish-brown highlights at the extremities (especially the top). Nice head that is small, but leaves a thin film on top of the beer and some broken lace. Mocha in color.
Really big, sweet alcohol hits the nose from the aroma.
Tastes are more of the same from the nose, but surprisingly the beer is VERY light and non-aggressive. Tiny notes of licorice and charcoal, but along with the (surprisingly) gentle warming alcohol, the beer is relatively simple and easy. There is very little evidence of any extensive spices here, but again that may have faded over time. Bitterness builds over the bottle and lingers a little. The bitterness comes from a dark chocolate notes.
A few notes of oxidation but the beer is in decent shape. I wouldn't want this to get much older so a pretty good decision to open this now.
I've never had this fresh, and as such I don't really know how this has matured but my guess is that time as calmed this beer quite a lot. It's really extremely mellow and I like it very much."
Cigar City Brewing,Jai Alai Cedar Aged IPA - Humidor Series,,,American IPA,7.5%,bottle,4.00,4,4,4,4,4,11/13/10,"750 mL capped bottle from a recent Jacksonville visit. Bottle label has the large ""H"" on the front as per a (newer) design than in the BA db picture.
Pour is a hazy, clouded light orange with a lovely, thick and creamy head.
The creamy nature of the beer carries forward to the mouthfeel which is quite rich.
This is one interesting beer with a LOT of white pepper and herbal notes. It's really quite medicinal amongst the strong hop base, and the beer comes together quite well. The light aniseed and floral notes are repetitive but on each mouthful there seems to be a slightly different angle which keeps the beer interesting. Perhaps a note of mixed spices as well.

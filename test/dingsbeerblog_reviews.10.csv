BrewDog,Bashah,,,American Black Ale,8.6%,bottle,3.08,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,4/10/11,"12 oz bottle.
Batch 352 which I think says 12/19/10 as the bottled on date, but I bought this way before that so that cannot be correct. My suspicion is that is a best before date. Anyway...
Black pour with some brownish highlights. Not much head, very little lace, but it settles to give a spotty, creamy film on the surface.
Nose offers plenty of hop character, and it is typically aggressive for the style and the two breweries involved. 
That carries forward to the taste where the hops could be described as medicinal. It's not so much a question of bitterness, but there is a distinct flavor of herbal charcoal note.
There is a creamy element to the beer which suggests a hoppy stout rather than something lighter.
Not bad, but not a beer or style that I ever likely to fall in love with."
Mad River Brewing Company,Steelhead Extra Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),5.6%,bottle,2.08,2.5,2,2,2.5,2,4/9/11,"12 oz stubbie bottle. Blue label that is different to the picture in the BA db. As a single form Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour is a tad disappointing as the beer sits somewhat lifeless with a classic macro look - no head, no retention, no lace and a golden body. Color is fine, carbonation is not. Head is particularly disappointing to me.

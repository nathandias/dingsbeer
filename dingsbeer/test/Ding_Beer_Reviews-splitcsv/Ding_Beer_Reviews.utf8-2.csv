I suppose that reflects both the distribution of Sam Adams and the relative power of BBC's advertising reach - they really are a macro, micro!
I actually bought this 22 oz bomber on the road in OH. It's been here in GA for a few months now but I've only seen it here as a 12 pack, then again I've not really been looking for it.
Pour is pretty much as expected with good clarity but the color is really VERY light almost to the point of being watery in appearance. I was surprised at the lack of real color. Wispy, eggshell white, delicate head with some nice lace.
Nose is a little bit corny, a little sweet and slightly vegetal. I might even say ""macro"" like! Not distinctive and somewhat unimpressive. Lacks hop character.
Tastes are fine, but lack a real Saaz BITE in the finish that I'm usually looking for in my Pilsners. There are some competing hop notes with a touch of grapefruit, a touch of metallic coinage and some fresh green notes, BUT it seems a little muddled. When I say muddled, I don't mean in a ""messy"", unpleasant way, rather it seems that the competing hops seem to add up to somewhat less than they should. It doesn't quite come together for me and I think that simplicity would have been better.
I'm not sure that the beer has benefited from the over complication of hops - too clever? Unimpressive to me with a very watery character and some serious lack of depth. Disappointing."

Standard, balck pour with a less than impressive mocha-like head (ABV obviously curtails this a little)) but still surprisingly poor given the fizzy nature of the beer. The carbonation seems really high at first and this leads to an annoyingly, prickly mouthfeel that subsides a bit but seems present throughout the brew for me.
Nose and tastes release a LOT of burned character, and it all gets a bit much charcoal like for me. As kevin said, burned berries are in there.
Not much smooth character at all, and although the beer does lose some carbonation as the time passes, it still seems overly aggressive and bitter. Not much chocalte, malt or coffee to temper the sharp edges.
I generally really like Southampton but this beer seems a bit on the high side of burned for me. Alcohol was obviously opresent but not too aggressive, but the charcoal notes would simply not die for me.
I dunno, this just didn't do it much for me, perhaps a beer that would benefit from some longer term aging?"

Pour is a solid looking, strong orange body with a small amount of head but excellent, sticky lace.
Nose and tastes reveal plenty of fresh, citrus hop character and not much else. Decent sweetness accompanies the hop-fix and malts hold it together nicely.
A good example of how the hops can be amped up without causing a palate meltdown. As balanced as a DIPA can ever hope to beer, the beer drinks fairly easily but palate fatigue could still settle in quite quickly.
For me, strictly a one-off, hp-fix beer, but nevertheless a very nice departure from me usually favored path."

Pour gives a lovely, deep garnet body and some head and lace that were better than I was expecting. It had some real depth in the visuals.
A very surprising beer. I was waiting to be overrun with the Bourbon experience but the rush of alcohol and warming vanilla notes simply did not come. Some age on this beer may have altered it dramatically, and the beer was very mellow.
Oddly it seemed to have some earth notes, and a little grass hay and green feel. I wouldn't go as far as to say ""saison-like"", not did I taste any ""funk"" as such, but there seemed to be a fresh hop note around the beer. It remained sweet (as a I was expecting) but it did NOT deliver on the BIG bourbon note. To be honest, although i was surprised I actually still enjoyed the beer very much.
My guess is that a little age has gone a long way to changing this beer which was interesting.
More drinkable than I thought it might be as well.
A bit of crazy experience with this one and I wouldn't mind betting that my tasting was pretty atypical."

Rich looking dark brown pour with a creamy, tan head. Some nice, creamy lace and a thin film forms on the surface and around the rim.
A few cocoa notes and some Belgian yeast in the nose, along with a bit of hop presence.
The beer doesn't deliver many (if any) typical Dark Belgian character. Outside of the look, it gives a slightly odd cocoa note (that I don't much care for) and is low on the advertised spices. It also doesn't really come through on the big, plummy dark Belgian fruit either. Some residual sweetness BUT a surprising amount of hop presence. The hops come through is a strange aniseed like manner which I find less than appealing. Dry character that I suppose comes from the cocoa input. Lacks rich, creamy alcoholic and deep fruit character.
Not a bad beer, but it does not do the job as a BSDA, nor does it deliver a typical Christmas spice character. I'm afraid it does not come together all that well either."

Very simple, but well constructed brew.
Orange, slightly chill-hazed body underneath the firm, white egg-shell head; average lace and retention. Looks solid.
Very light citrus aroma with a decent malt base that comes through with some English style biscuit flavors in he flavor. Tangy, orange based hop finish, but nothing of any real consequence.
Mouthefeel and drinkability seem fairly standard.
Tasty and simple fare that one could drink a couple of and real mildly satisfied.
Another beer that I would drink over BMC, but in no way am likely to seek out. A nice beer to drink locally, fresh and close to the source I suspect, but away from those circumstances this beer is likely to be lost in the sea of standard APA 
(and such) offerings."

Probably should have taken a closer look at the label here rather than just grabbing it, as I'm not a huge fan of either Dead Guy or barrel aging in general - ho hum.
At first glance I wondered if this was another of those annoying Rogue habits where the beer get re-packaged and re-named. Apparently I'm in the clear.
Beer seems slightly over-carbonated as I open the bottle.
Creamy head sits a top of a light copper body with a large stream of bubble. Some lace, retention OK.
Nose reveals a light, bourbon/whiskey nose with some mellow vanilla. The nose of the liquor is stronger than appears in the taste, but the beer seems to struggle with an awkward sweetness and a bitter finish. It's all a bit strange with apparently strongly competing flavor profiles up against one another. Finish is annoyingly bitter and dry. Metal adds confusion in the lingering, oaky ending. the whiskey element is really a light caramel or toffee which is OK but not my favorite flavor profile. Plenty of malt presence but it never comes together for me.
Mouthfeel is one of the better features and is relatively rich.
This doesn't work much for me which is not surprising as we are starting with a beer I'm not in love with and added the barrel component which I'm not a fan of either. Not for me."

Pour gives a standard black affair with medium head, retention and a little lace.
Nose and tastes are quite restrained with all of the usual roast, light bitter and mild-chocolate notes but it is ALL very restrained and tempered. This is also true of the alcohol which gives a tiny bit of heat to the finish, but to describe it any other way than subtle would be wrong.
If you are looking for an aggressive, hop-forward high alcohol beast for your RIS experience, I think that you will be disappointed. I on the other had, was delighted by the approachability of this beer and the way that it drank - super offering.
Alcohol is very well hidden, and along with the mild roast notes and understated nature of the beer, this is extremely drinkable and does not seems like an aggressive beer at all. The drinkability score reflects some of that.
Tasty and a beer i would definitely try again."

Pour is the standard , lose to black affair with virtually no head other than a thin film of mocha foam. Mouthfeel seems a little slick but comes with the standard coffee and light alcohol notes. The oak-aging seems very light with perhaps an increased vanilla presence and some edges taken off.
I really didn't find this to be much different to the regular version but perhaps it's just smoothed out some; it may be that the same effect could have been achieved by simply letting the original sit.
In the end l enjoyed the beer but is it that different to the original?"

Nicely presented, black waxed 750 mL bottle. Seemed to be doble-dipped on the wax which made it a pain to get into. Capped underneath.
Pour is a very dark brown affair with one of the most interesting head colors that i have ever seen. It was almost a fluorescent yellow/gold/orange color, and was made up of large bubbles at the edge of the beer. Very odd looking.
The nose and tastes are VERY complex with layer after layer of sweet, molasses based sugars that do not let up. It's a very sweet beer with plenty of alcohol and brown sugar based complexity. Some dark fruits as well, but the beer is certainly never ""fruity"" by any stretch of the imagination. Alcohol builds and the obvious lack of carbonation (consider ABV and style), alhough appropriate , does begin to grate a little toward the middle of the vbottle.
I used a couple of glasses to marinate some salmon on the grill, and this was a good decision for two reasons. Firstly it provided a delicious , rich coating to the fish and secondly it allowed me to back away from the WHOLE bottle! It was beginning to creep up on me a bit.
Mouthfeel is excellent and smooth without ever getting overbearing and the beer (obviously) improves with temperature as the bottle is consumed.
A beer than one could really use to replace a nice liquor with, and the sweetness began to take the beer from Old Ale into the English Barleywine designation.
Very interesting and a beer that i'd like to try again in different circumstances."
"Yuengling Brewery ","Yuengling Bock","","","Bock","5.1%","on-tap","3.78","3.5","4","4","3","3.5","2/13/10","On tap Taco Mac, Douglasville, GA, USA.
Pour is an attractive, mid to dark copper colour with thinnish, wispy head. Fades quickly.
Lots of bready malts in the nose. One of the more ""bready"" beers that I have encoutered of late.
Clean delivery of good malt and hop balance. Bitterness with a gentle metallic aftertaste. Slight sweet and sour combo brings the whole thing together. Conversely for the typical malt profile, this bock seems to finish a touch on the dry end of the spectrum. Adding to the experience is the Enlish style biscuit malt profile that pairs well with the slight bitterness.
Carbonation is a little high which provokes a slightly prickly mouthfeel that the beer could do without. Apart from that th remains drinkable and tasty."

Pour is a dark, dark brown essentially black with a fizzy, coffee colored head. Retention and lace not great.
Nice dark estery malts and fruit in the nose.
Tastes reflect some of those traits but some oxidation plus somewhat surprising mild licorice notes that one might find in a Belgian style stout. Sweetness and alcohol both present but really quite reserved. The stout notes are really quite prominent and they build.
Smooth and silky in the mouth, with a slight bitter banana in the finish - the only real obvious sign of the style.
Still drinking well as long as you don't mind a touch of oxidation (I don't) and some maturing of the flavors. I did not have this fresh so I have no idea how it has changed, nevertheless very drinkable and tasty."

Pour is a very attractive, deep, orange gold body with a pretty good, dense well-formed head. Even some lace and pretty nice retention. Surprisingly good looking.
Carbonation is constant and the nose gives some slight sweetness.
The tastes are quite sweet with a nice malt base and light hop finish. More sweetness and some grains come through and the finish is satisfying. The aftertaste lingers with a touch of bitterness. Deeper and more complex that one might expect with some toffee like sweetness.
A little bit of slickness in the mouth, but to be honest it works quite well. Finishes creamier than the first gulps suggest.
This has the character of a beer with a lot more alcohol and reminds me a bit of a better tasting, higher ABV Euro Lager. It drinks better than I expected and is really quite tasty.
This is a very nice beer that drinks well and does a lot for the style and the brewery. Surprising on both counts."

Macro color but carbonation is strong. Head and lace decent too. Surprinsingly impressive pour especially in the bottle. Light hops in the nose with some simple malt/grain. After that all balanced malts.
Smooth & simple. Some low level bittering and dryness. Mouthfeel is quite good and better than the look would suggest.
Pale malts dominate in terms of tastes with a light sprinkling of hops on top.
Tasty if somewhat unspectacular. Thirst quenching. One of the better Abita offerings IMO."

Pour is a very surprising golden hue which s extremely attractive. Much lighter than I was expecting with a very good-looking, white, rocky head and lace. The head and retention are especially pleasing when you consider the ABV. Talking of the alcohol it's nowhere to be seen. Extraordinarily well hidden and I would have NEVER guessed this is as high as it is. Amazing.
Plenty of fruity grapefruit notes hold up the whole beer. There is no doubt that this is a very hoppy DIPA, but the fruit character is something that I was not expecting in such large doses - very welcome.
Drinks easily without any cloying sweetness or dramatic, astringent bitterness.
For me the grapefruit and other estery fruit notes make this beer a winner. One of the few brews that can pull off the hop presence and alcohol in a relatively subtle and restrained way. Excellent beer."
"Rogue Brewery (Brewer's on the Bay)","Chatoe Rogue First Growth Dirtoir Black Lager","","","Schwarzbier","6.0%","bottle","3","4","3","3","2.5","3","2/7/10","Silly name.
22 oz bottle in the usual Rogue presentation from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Jet black pour but without asignificant head or lace.
The hop nose and hop tastes are suprisingly reserved for Rogue, but at the same time too large for the style IMO. This is essentially an ""Americanized"" version of a Schwarzbier which, unsurprisingly, takes the hop profile way too far for me. Lingering bitterness replaces a sweet edge, and the hops also provide a biting note that detracts from the mouthfeel for me as well. In the grand scheme of things not especially astringent, but in the style we're dealing with here it's way off for me.
Roasty malts are present, but again they seem more bitter than we should expect in a classic Schwarz.
Drinkability is OK as long as you are not looking for a classic example.
In summary, although not a beer that is particularly ""hoppy"", it's still *too* hoppy and pretty much exactly as I anticipated from Rogue."

Nose has some light floral notes with a touch of white pepper and a little yeast character.
The tastes reflect some of the nose but refuse to deliver the sweetness or indeed the alcohol blast, that one would expect from a beer in this style. Spices are generally missing.
Finish is dry and the bitterness builds to a degree. More floral character amongst the dry ending.
Tasty and drinkable, but not really typically ""Tripel"" - too dry and laclks much sweetness. Still enjoyable."

Nice clarity and good dark copper color on the pour. Head is small but provides some lace.
Nose faithfully creates some decent if simple, toasty malt. Tastes deliver the expected malt notes but the beer also brings with a surprising level of dry character. Dry notes are repeated in the finish and aftertaste almost to the point of giving some noticeable hop character - not really what I was anticipating. 
Carbonation in the glass seems quite strong without manifesting any kind of prickle. The bitterness seems to build a little too. As the beer drinks the aftertaste seems to give a bit of a dry, bakers chocolate, cocoa flavor as well.
Decent balance but the beer seems dry to me and this is despite the relatively good depth of malt. In that respect a bit of a paradox. Drinkability suffers a touch because of the dry notes."

Pour is a very attractive golden hue with very good sticky lace. Appearance is the best part of the beer for me.
Steady but mild bitterness with a clean edge that showcase the apparently pale malt base and the fresh hop feel. Aroma is clean. 
Well constructed for sure, but to be honest ultimately not a stand-out by any stretch. The bazillionth solid American IPA - yawn. Not sure how thi stuff will carve a niche for itself.
Decent drinkability but not something I'm likely to seek again."

You never quite know what you are going to get with these cheap, 12 oz singles from TJ's but to be honest more often than not I have been really pleased with what I've found. This was no exception.
Really deep, garnet copper body with some lovely light coffee-colored head. Lace and retention are not the best, but the clarity and the depth of color are both very nice.
Lovely sweetness in the taste - I suspect it will be too much fro some, but if you like a sweet, malt based profile this hits the spot immediately. Burned sugars ans LOTS of caramel - I mean, LOTS. The bock/Dopplebock characteristics are not really too prevalent and the yeast character is restrained, but the sugar and sweetness are certainly there. Some dark fruits too, and a decent depth on the mouthfeel.
The alcohol is extremely well hidden.
Very pleased with this one, and perhaps not a classic in the style, nor a beer that is likely to attract many plaudits, but if you love a sweet brew with heavy emphasis on the malts, and you enjoy excellent value I think that you may be delighted."

Nice copper clarity in the body and some decent head and lace form in the pint glass. Looks nice. 
Carbonation is constant if not huge, but at the same time it is adequate.
Nose has a tiny bit of smoke but this is not a large presence. The main component seems to be a solid malt base.
The smoke is slightly more pronounced in the taste but it still remains fairly mild. The depth of smoke does not require food in the way that some other smoked beer do. Malts again come to the fore and the mouthfeel is quite silky. The aftertaste has a pleasing bitterness.
All on all very tasty and pleasing. low key bitterness and low key smoke but it works very well. Impressive."

Pour is is slightly darker than expected color with some nice looking head and lace. The beer lacks much clarity and is a darkish, honey-orange hue. (The final pour from the bottle into the Duvel tulip gets quite soup-like from the bottle conditioned sediment).
Nose has a significant hop aroma, and the tastes also have quite a hop forward presence. In that respect this beer is horribly mis-categorized as a Belgian Strong Pale and at the very least needs to be called a Belgian IPA. I would go as far as to say that the Belgian characteristics of yeast and candy are sufficiently absent to call this an American IPA. There's just not much ""Belgian"" about the taste of this beer at all. In that respect I'm horribly disappointed.
Hops are grassy and ""wet"" and highly aromatic. No too much bitterness and the beer ends with a sweetish flourish. Some mild grapefruit in the finish and the beer ends with a slight dry note and a bitter aftertaste. Mild burn.
Mouthfeel is OK.
Fine I guess, but Belgian Strong Pale? Absolutely not."

The hope here is that they will be coming to GA but this looks like a one-off special release with a larger distribution than normal.
Pour is a disappointing, drab looking brown with a serious lack of carbonation or life.
The nose and tastes give a slightly acidic, sweet and sour like affair which has me wondering if this beer has turned a bit. It's only a few weeks old and I do not see any dating on the bottle, and frankly it should be able to survive a few weeks of correct storage.
Despite the strange flavor profile the beer is actually quite drinkable. Almost a fruit note (which is pretty odd for the style) and some decent spruce like pine hops in the finish and aftertaste. No sign of any oak.
A little less American Brown and a touch more English character which suits my palate well."

Usual SN presentation. Delighted to find a new SN beer that does NOT fit squarely into the ""large hopped IPA"" category! Hooray.
Classic pour with a high, if somewhat poorly retained head and little lace, on top of a great looking, golden body with tremendous clarity. Carbonation is perfect.
Malts hold the hop bitterness together nicely. A beer that perfectly showcases the crisp, sharp, bitter metallic notes of the hops in the style. Bitterness lingers nicely. Almost a slight medicinal aftertaste that fits well with the overall profile. A few grassy, organic notes which add to the feel of ""fresh"" in this beer.
Refreshing, sharp and clean, just about all you could ask from the flavor profile for a beer of this style.
Delightful, sharp and hits a drinkable note that few SN beers do for me - very pleased."

Slightly disconcerting, neon-like, fluorescent yellowish/green appearance. Urine comes to mind with an absolute clarity.
I was expecting a bigger nose and taste of lime but really it was quite muted. Flavors are not really offensive and with baking hot sun and circumstances that did not call for flavor, I suppose it would be possible to drink this, however I think a larger lime element might make it more palatable. As it is it's just a bland, sweetish macro effort with virtually no taste. Despite the lack of lime notes it still get's cloying and sweet very quickly.
Blast of carbonation that comes quickly and then disappears almost immediately. Zero head and zero retention.

Poured into the Tucher Weizen glass the beer gives the requisite cloudiness but a darker-than-usual deep golden/orange butterscotch color. Head is OK, but lacks real density, retention and much lace. Disappointing would be harsh, but not the best looking Hefe by some distance.
Light banana greets the nose.
Carbonation seems about right, but the beer itself lacks a bit of depth. Not thin, but could do with an extra shot of wheat, yeasties in the final swirl. More pretty light banana and a touch of spice in the mix. Again muted.
No a big flavored Hefe by any stretch of the imagination. Not to say that I didn't enjoy it, but it's not a bold or especially fulsome beer."

Pours offers a cloudy, slightly watery looking light orange body and a decent rocky head. Some lacing but not the best I've seen. Appearance no the very best and I suspect that the beer will taste much better than it looks.
Nose has light acidity but seems quite sweet. The tastes reflect this. There's a lot of fruity sweetness that comes with the mild grapefruit. There's a surprising amount of sweetness here. The beer also begins to get slightly cloying which is about the last thing that I expected.
Yeasty and full in the mouth with even more sweetness.
I dunno, given the pedigree of this beer, and the price I was pretty disappointed in the final analysis. Lacked clean edges and ultimately came up short for me. The beer seemed a bit muddy and lacked significant definition."

Just about the best bargain that one could hope for on Deus.
Heavy, heavy foil over the corked & caged bottle. Lots of gun smoke on opening, but not quite the pop or the gush that I was half-expecting. poured into champagne flutes the pour resembles a typical champagne with great cascading bubbles and that typical huge bubbly head that can get a little annoying after a few minutes. Eventually the beer settles down and we get to where we need to be. Some nice lace and very good, persistent carbonation. Color is a golden macro lager type that is darker than your typical sparkling wine.
Nose has some medicinal, sweetness and a strange, difficult to place herbal quality. 
Tastes are not really what I was expecting at all. I was anticipating a dry, champagne like experience and with perhaps some tartness. Perhaps not a Brute-like tartness but at least some semblance of white wine/sparkling dry character; there really was very little of this.
The beer drinks VERY sweetly to me - sweet as in sugary, not sweet as in S-W-E-E-T! There are quite a lot of apple and cider characteristics but they don't come with either the usual tart character or the dry nature of many, high quality beverages of this type. The missing dry notes, and the relatively missing yeast influence is quite surprising to me. 
The second half of the bottle was consumed after it had been sitting in an ice-bucket for some time, and as a result the carbonation seemed even more prickly than the firs half - to me, this was a good thing as it seemed to help the beer become drier and more well-defined. I think that temperature could be VERY important here and I might even look for a frosted glass! As we go down the bottle the sweetness gets a bit much - it never becomes cloying as such, but it is noticeable.
This IS a bottle which is between 7 and 8 years old so I might try a much younger bottle next time. For now, I'm a touch underwhelmed but I can see how this COULD be fantastic. I preferred Brute to this, but IT was really pretty tart. If we could reach a halfway house in between the two we'd have a really interesting beer.
Good, but for now I'm on the fence as to whether I would try this again. Next time ULTRA cold from the beginning and a younger bottle."

Mid-brown pour with some good clarity and plenty of persistent, fine carbonation. A thin film of froth forms on the surface of the beer but not much lace on the glass.
The smell has a very, very light acidic touch and a bit of dry fruit. Pretty reserved though.
Very little acidity in the beer. Not much fruit either, and in the final analysis the beer drinks in a very neutral manner. Tastes a little like a base of sodium hydrogen carbonate solution to which a very small amount of light fruit has been added. The finish gives a touch more slight, tartness but hardly a trace.
The lightest of light Flanders Reds and a good introduction that could be describes as somewhat atypical but at the same time might be accessible for newcomers to the style."

Pretty green, grassy hop aroma is the simple nose. Not massive, but clear and clean in its presence and without pretense. It is what it is.
The grassy nature is forward in the taste. Plenty of ""C"" hop character but it never gets aggressive in the slightest. Very balanced and reserved. It also drinks below the 7.20%. The bitterness and hops do come into play a touch more in the finish and aftertaste but it's still straightforward and non pretentious.

Clean lines define the look of the brew, true to style with nice clarity on the pour and some very good, persistent carbonation. The beer looks good with the golden body and most importantly a well retained head that produces some nice lace.
The one thing that the beer lacks is a serious Saaz like bite in the finish. There are two ways to look at this. On the plus side for the establishment it's probably brewed in that manner to keep it approachable for the non-beer types which make up the majority of GB customers so it makes sense; BUT on the other hand it takes it away from a typical, authentic version of the style and as a result really seriously detracts from the one of my main reasons for drinking a Pils! In short, makes sense for GB but doesn't work too well for me.
Still non-offensive but a little too basic for me."

Sure there is a cloudy yellow body, and sure there are a few clove like notes as well, but the mouthfeel is weak and the beer feels overall quite watery - in my book the cardinal sin for a Hefe.
It's as if the beer has been deliberately taken down a notch or two, perhaps because the majority of the clientele wouldn't appreciate or like the full force Hefe?
I dunno, ultimately disappointing and this is not a beer that i would recommend trying at the GB chain. They make some good, respectable beers but this is not one of them.

I enjoy a smoked porter, especially in the winter months and if smoke s going to work in a beer at all, a porter is a great style to match up with the ashes.
Lovely black body with plenty of brown/red highlights. Mocha head is high early, retention and lace are good. Solid.
Nose and and tastes give some noticeable, lactose like milkiness. Smoke pushes the milk sugar away and the sweetness drops off to give a nice, authentic porter flavor. Smoke lingers a touch in the aftertaste. Lightly roasted notes in the malts. Simple and restrained - not too aggressive.
Mouthfeel is relatively thin and does not deliver a punch. Disappointing might be a little harsh, but it certainly comes up a bit short in terms of complexity and richness in the mouth.
Tasty and solid. I liked Left Hand's Smokejumper better in recent months, but this is still solid, enjoyable and a decent example. Just needs a touch more noisy, depth."

Pretty impressive presentation. $15.99 from Arbor Place Beverage, Douglasville, GA, USA. Cap has an extra plastic appendage on the underside and it comes off with some force.
Pour is a very attractive, orange copper color with some excellent creamy head, with persistent, spotty coverage on the surface of the beer and some nice lace. Head characteristics (in terms of retention) are especially pleasing.
Somewhat musty, light sherry notes appear early in the nose. A touch of alcohol too.
Tastes have a lots of caramel based notes but the large sweetness that usually follows such a start in the style, does not materialize. Rather we get a sudden bitter, dry taste plus some very distinct herbal notes. The earthy bitterness lingers and holds off the blast of sweetness that I am expecting all the way through to the finish - it just never comes! Light, warming alcohol in the finish as well and a little more herbal character.
Enjoyable but definitely NOT a typical, Belgian Strong Dark. There is an absence of dark fruits, a definite serious lack of sugary sweetness, some missing alcohol and some herbal hop-based bitterness that one would not expect. Having said all of that, I WAS expecting something different given the origin - these Italian beers are a law onto themselves and they reflect some interesting taste profiles.
Perhaps more Dubbel like in the final analysis.
Well, interesting but I really prefer a classic BDSA. Has some interesting herbal qualities which I general i like, but it doesn't quite come together for me. Like many of these Italian offerings, whilst I have enjoyed some of them, I have also found them to be poor value for money."

Nice orange colored pour with some excellent head, lace and retention. Head is a noticeable white with high pillowing and quite fluffy. A touch of hazy in the body.
Nose and tastes are muted in terms of hops which pretty much matches the style, but the malt profile seems a little on the low side to me. A grassy, hay-like linger taste finishes the beer.
Very non-offensive which may be a euphemism for ""bland"", but to be honest that would be unfair - it's a better bee than that would suggest.

Nice malty nose with a hint of hops.
Quite dry in the finish despite the obvious malts up front. There is something distinct about Abita beers and I'm not sure if it's a particular yeast strain or hop profile but it seems to cut across a number of their beers.
Plenty of light nut notes followed by a controlled hop bitterness that adds the dry finish. Bitterness lingers somewhat with some metallic character. There is almost a fresh, organic, grassy, wet hop note in there too.
As usual, nothing earth shattering here but a decent example of the style and quite drinkable. This really is not a ""Christmas"" ale by many measures but still drinkable and enjoyable."

Magic Hat certainly makes some ""Odd"" beer and this one certainly fits into the series - literally!
Pour produces a pretty nice, pillow like head that sits on top of a not particularly attractive, murky, dirty brown body. Not much retention but at least some sticky lace.
Nose gives away a sort of sweet and sour whiff.
The aroma is actually how I would describe the taste of this beer too - definitely a sweet and sour affair. Some fruitiness as well and then an extra dash of low-level tart in the finish. The beer is clearly NOT anything like many (or even any) other American Wild Ales as it gives a strange sweetness among the slight tart flavor, and there certainly isn't a normal, wild, brett function anywhere. Some expression of green apples but certainly not ""sour"" or ""funky"" in the classic sense.
A ""Wild Ale"" for the masses perhaps? As such it's not really a Wild Ale at all!
I thought it was OK to drink 12 oz of, but I wouldn't visit it again nor would I compare this to just about anything else in the category. 
More strange stuff from magic Hat, but that's what I've come to expect. Weird."

750 mL corked & caged affair, $7.99 from Tower on Piedmont, Atlanta, GA, USA. 
I must admit, when I saw the description that included the honey and the citrus peel I was expecting a beer that fell more into the Belgian Strong Pale category, so to see a Belgian Dark flow from the elaborate bottle was a slight shock. I love the green and gold color scheme.
Pour is a rich looking, thick, tight-headed beer with a reddish Dubbel appaerance. Head has a delicious looking mocha/cappucino color and appearance. Lace is nice, as is the spotty film that forms on surface as the brew sits and warms. Head retention is good.
A touch of sweet orange based liquor in the nose.
Upfront we have typical (and tasty) Beglian yeast and candy notes. NOT overpoweringly sweet, and somewhat surprisingly the beer finishes with some Champagne, dry like character. Light dark fruits as opposed to the more typical heavy figs and raisins.
Drinks much lighter than many in the style and I suppose that you can look at this as both a positive and a negative. To me is *slightly* detracts, but very little. Definitely a ""lighter"" more approachable version of the style.
This may not be the best BSDA out there, but it is one of the very best American efforts at the style. It's also as good as some of the Belgian brewed BSDA's, AND at $7.99 for the 750 mL it's definitely one of the best (if not THE best) value examples on the market.
Along with Local 1, an instant classic in my book. I'll be buying more of both."

Pour is a good looking black with a few brownish highlights. Head is initially nice and creamy but the retention and lace are both very poor even when considering the ABV. Marked down for that.
A nice rich nose with some light roastiness, some chocolate and a touch of alcohol. Considering the word ""Belgian"" is used in the name of the beer and the label, the beer lacks much of a Belgian yeast element.
The tastes reflect the lack of Belgian character for me. On the plus side it is fairly light and drinkable despite the fact that the alcohol is definitely present. It drinks nicely with more than a touch of warming alcohol and some smooth, easy drinking chocolate notes. More warming alcohol in the finish too. A lack of Belgian character and a strange, lingering bitterness in the finish subtract from the experience somewhat.
One of the better Side Projects for me, but still nothing to write home about for me. Seems to me like the beer is trying too hard."

Interesting beer. Firstly there is an appearance that is reminiscent of one of the classic, English Pale Ales with superb sticky, white lace and a dark, honey orange body. The head and lace are very good. Could be classic, cask Pale Ale from the look. The sticky nature of the lace reminds me a little of a West Coast DIPA but it is really quite, white.
Nose has some very sweet, light malt notes with a very subtle, light undertone of alcohol. All of the nose characteristics are carried forward to the taste and there is a really light, subtle touch to this beer. There is a hint of hoppy bitterness in the final wave which although NOT strong, still gives away a serious departure from a classic English Barleywine.
Finishes with a malty blast and a caramel smoothness. Alcohol is very well hidden, although the aftertaste gives me a little more than I wanted.
This beer is NOT typical of an English Barleywine in as much as it is not really sweet and it does not give many sherry-like notes. Interesting, since it seems to combine several characteristics from a number of styles but ultimately not something I am likely to want to go back to."

The label says that this is an American take on an English Old Ale - should be interesting.
Pour is a very nice, chestnut body with some good clarity. Head, lace and retention are minimal, but largely as expected with the 8.00% ABV tag.
Nose and tastes give the same, slightly odd mixture. The beer starts with plenty of malts, and a really quite distinct nutty character but as it drinks the hop character comes more to the fore leading to a fairly dry finish. The finish also gives some more alcohol and a few dry sherry notes. Aftertaste is surprisingly bitter with some degree of metal. There's a hint of brown ale base as well. Light vanilla.
Ultimately I'm really not sure about this. I winds up sort of in nomansland with a nice malty start and then a far-too-hoppy-for-the-old-ale-style ending. It never gets to American Strong territory either, and to me the beer is a touch unsatisfying in the way it's not really being one thing or another.
I dunno, this just ends up in between too many flavor profiles to sit well with me. Too much of mish-mash."

As is sometimes the case, an interesting turn of events lead me to pick this beer up for the first time; I grab one in a mixed sixer at Mac's and then head downtown to meet Wes at Cypress for a quick lunchtime pint. Low and behold, ABC's Chris is at the bar and he pulls a couple for me - thanks Chris, you're very kind.



The story behind the new beer is that it was born out of a combo/blend that some guys have been doing at the brewery called a ""dirty blond(e)"", where they have been mixing the brown and the blonde for sometime. The Vortex guys thought this was a good concept to re-launch the Laughing Skull beer under, and so the completely new beer was born under the old name. From what Chris was telling me, essentially we get the brown malt base and then the beer is created from that point.



Pour is a mid-orange body with excellent clarity. Head is not huge but it does leave some lace and some spotty retention on the surface of the brew.



Nose is a very, very distinct soapy affair with the hops being a little medicinal. The soap aspect was quite strong for me. 



Tastes are sweet from the initial malt base but are backed up quickly with a very clean, crisp almost ""lager-like"" finish. In that respect, it's somewhat unusual for an amber ale in as much as the beer feels dry in the second half in a way that a typical amber ale may not. The aftertastes have some biscuity, English malts and the beer is without question pretty clean. It feels ""sessionable"" in terms of its drinkability, but without knowing the precise ABV it's obviously impossible to specifically categorize it that way.



It's tasty and I enjoyed it, but obviously this is NOT ground-breaking in any way, however it does show that ABC is really beginning to think about what they are doing and is making a really conscience effort to step up and make stuff happen. In that respect I applaud their efforts."

Nice clarity on the reddish-brown pour with a flimsy white head that breaks up quickly. Some watery lace and some legs when we swirl it.
Nose is strong with alcoholic vanilla coming to the fore.
Tastes are all vanilla bourbon dominated, but the power is restrained and not overwhelming. Bourbon-aged beers are really not my thing, but this one is somewhat controlled and drinks very nicely. Light to medium body which is true to the brown ale base. Light burn of alcohol and bourbon up front, but then a dry element kicks in, which, CONVERSELY does NOT reflect the usual malty, sweetish aspects of a typical brown ale. The finish reiterates the bourbon, vanilla and alcohol and it lingers slightly.
Tasty beer and this type of beer isn't usually really my thing, so I would say this is a pretty good example. Drinkability is good with some warming character but everything is in check. I like the restraint - it makes for a better drinking experience than many bourbon influenced brews."

Darkish, golden pour with excellent head, lace and retention. packaged in the Allagash flute/tulip, the beer holds its own nicely in the glass.
Nose and tastes give a light smoke with plenty of peat in the background. it threatens to get quite strong but somehow is held together with some sweeter malts. the malt base seems surprisingly strong for a bee of this kind but it comes together nicely.
Plenty to be happy about here, but as with many smoked beers if you are going to consume any kind of quantity it really needs to be paired with food. Even after my relatively small glass, I wasn't exactly ""tiring"" of the taste, but I had enjoyed plenty. Drinkability is not superb, even though the beer is very good.

The tastes are AMAZING when you consider the nature of the beer. There is a lot of tangerine, orange and sweetened grapefruit, a VERY clean finish and a lingering hop bitterness that HONESTLY reminds me of some of the better, casked, highly-hopped English Pale Ales.
Mouthfeel is where things go south, but if you can imagine a super, crisp, English Pale with a decent amount of thirst-quenching qualities, then you can get a handle on this beer.

This brew is all about a complicated array of malts with some hop presence in the finish. There are a lot of competing sweet malts jostling for attention, and in the end I feel it gets a bit muddled. Too complicated in the malt department.
The other dominating feature is the earthy, almost peat like taste. It's NOT smoked, but the organic, soil like character seems to cloud the clarity of the beer. Very prominent and it's not a funk based thing at all - muddy!
It drinks OK, and I am not saying that I did not like the beer, but it's a little too crowded in terms of tastes and experiences for me. The beer does not drink very cleanly at all, and for me that's a bit of a problem."

Pour is a miserable looking, pale, insipid off-yellow cloudy (almost beige) affair that looks worryingly weak in terms of body, head, retention and lace.
The nose and tastes reflect the look, and frankly remind me of old dishwater. Both aspects of the beer are horribly washed out, almost as if one (or more) ingredients had been left out! The citrus and yeast elements seem as if they have been (literally) watered down. At first I suspected that this would all change once I swirled the yeast from the bottom of the bottle, and if act I ended up inverting the 2/3 full bottle several times to attempt to improve things. The change was minimal and beer beer remained washed-out in all aspects.
Watery and lacking any depth, the mouthfeel fails to redeem the disappointing tastes. 
This was so poor that I was beginning to wonder if the beer had a perhaps gone through a problem in production where insufficient attention had been given to the bottle-conditioning. Without a batch number or date on the bottle, that's obviously impossible to follow-up on.

The beer pours with a bright orange, honey colored, murky body. Head is absent and as a result, as is lace and retention. 
Carbonation is the problem here. The beer is flat and this (I guess) is another Lost Abbey issue. Zero carbonation and therefore almost zero mouthfeel.
Nose and tastes give plenty of wheat and the yeast gives a German character for me. These are the dominating features, but there is an absence of spice, coriander, orange or much else. Very disappointing.
In the final analysis the carbonation problem screws the whole beer and maybe with a correction this would be better, but for now the beer is on hold for me.

Pour is an impressive, garnet one with nice clarity and a better head than one would expect from the style and the ABV. Even some retention and lace.
Initially the nose gives away little other than the standard hop-forward alcohol that one would anticipate for the style...but....
...as it warms it gets more interesting. I got this incredible, tannin, tea-like aroma and taste that I could NOT shake. It got stronger as the beer went on and even manifested itself in the finish with a puckeringly dry note that one would get from well-stewed tea. Obviously there are the American style hops, the alcohol and all the usual stuff going on in the tastes, but the tea element was very strong for me.
Anyway, because of the tea (and the look) I enjoyed this beer more than I thought I would. Worth a shot for the novelty."

Nose is medicinal, clean and semi-sweet.
Not a great deal of rye in the taste, which for me is a good thing. Plenty of baker's chocolate/cocoa with some mild rye in the finish. Aftertaste gives more chocolate. Mouthfeel gives some lively carbonation and a mild prickle which more me adds to the experience.

Dry, cocoa notes and bakers chocolate with a dose of greenish hops that seem a bit out of place in the Brown category for me. Finishes with more dry notes. The chocolate comes back in the aftertaste.
A bit ""green"" for me, this beer gives a bit of a fresh hop presence when it really ought to be rounded out with a sweeter note IMO. A bit edgy and slightly too bitter for the style.

Errr....Belgian Pale (as per current BA db designation), NO. Much more like a Brune.
Head and lace a quite poor and the body is a chestnut, deep brown.
Nose has a lot if peppery yeast.
Lots of pear and pineapple in the taste (along with a few other esters) which give the impression that the beer is going to be very fruity, however the character changes right at the end and in the finish and aftertaste. There is very surprising level of bitterness which kicks in. A hoppy, dry bitterness which seems very out of place. On the plus side the bitterness does not linger and the final flourish is an ethereal, fruity, slighly bubble-gum inspired blast.

Nose is deinitely the strongest aspect of this beer wih a great, truly rich chocolate aroma coming from the glass even without much agitation. Very strong - very nice.
Frankly, after that, things go downhill quite a lot. The beer is a little acidic and lacks any kind of mouth presence. Very thin and I might even say watery. I am NOT confusing this a being a bigger stout either, even by the standards of ""normal"", lower ABV stouts the beer seems somewhat insipid.
Tastes produce the choclate malt character that one expects but it is nowhere near the intensity promised in the nose and frankly they are disappointing. Not much of anything present in the tase in the way of alcohol or hops either.

Dry in the nose with some very light white pepper, but to be honest the nose is not this beers' strength.
Tastes are those of light citrus marmalade and then some increased (compared to the nose) white pepper.

Aggressive, Saaz based, alcoholic nose.
The tastes give the same aggressive hops. The tastes are bitter with a metallic edge and a lingering finish. The malt backbone is VERY substantial and to be honest it reminds me a little of DFH 120. The hop aroma is quite strong and reminiscent of a DIPA.

A very light drinking stout. Influence from the oysters? Maybe, but if there is an character at all it manifest in the light nature of the beer.
Mouthfeel is approaching thin, but it doesn't seem to detract from the experience at all. Perhaps a mild salty, brine element amongst the water, but to be honest this may be just a function of the mind playing tricks on the palate knowing that the oysters are in there. A very light touch on the roasted malts and the hop character is extremely reserved.
Reminded me a LOT of a typical, low ABV English Stout in the way that it drank.

Pour is an oily looking, fairly light brown liquid which gives astonishing ""legs"" in the glass. That, and the searing alcoholic nose, give the game away in terms of the ABV. A touch viscous in the mouth, but what the hell were you expecting??
The nose is simple to place for me. It reminds me of a Harvey's Bristol Cream Sherry. In fact, that, and the tastes which are almost identical, make this basically a sherry to me. It does have more alcohol presence than a normal fortified wine, but it is sweeter. There is a mild caramel note and some extra brown sugar on top but not much else. A drier finish than one might expect from the initial sweetness.
Delicious, moreish, mellow, sweet and alcohol laden, but to me not especially complex. Nor is this ""beer"" by any stretch of the imagination. Yes, I know the process and the ""formal"" categorization puts it there, but this simply isn't a beer when it comes to the drinking experience.
I REALLY, REALLY enjoyed it, but to call it anything other than a fortified wine of some description is largely meaningless - that's the experience you will get when you drink it regardless of the official designation.
$150-$200 a bottle? I dunno, that's really pushing it for me, especially when I can get largely the same warming alcohol experience from a number of other Sherry, Port and Madeira beverages. Still ""exceptional"" in many ways and a very, very enjoyable and tasty tipple, but to me we've moved out of beer and into an entirely different realm."

Heard various descriptions of this, including ""Black Pale Ale"" (which I cannot abide) so I was interested (and anxious) to see what this looked like before anything else.
The beer pours with a deep, granet, reddish hue with great clarity. Nice head and lace considering the ABV, it looks good in the glass. 
Semi-sweet nose with some sinus clearing, tea-like hops.
Tastes are obviously hop-forward and quite dry, but there is a degree of balanced sweetness which helps level it out a bit. Don't get me wrong, this is still a mightyly UNbalanced beer, but the malts are at least present to help it along a bit. The finish seems VERY, VERY green and raw. The green nature of the flavor is the linger feature.
As far as the mouthfeel goes, the beer is relatively thin and lacks much viscosity.
A poor man's Arrogant Bastard? Not as sweet or as smooth, but reminds me of it a little, especially the apperance.

In a nutshell, a poor man's Duvel with similar appearance but a lot less depth. Perhaps a touch harsh on the beer as it is not trying to emulate Duvel as far as I can tell (with the lower ABV and the regular Pale rather than Strong Pale categorizaton), but one can't help but make comparisons.

The nose was an unusual bready combination which seemed a bit out of place. It almost seemed O'fest in its character.
Tastes have some more odd, lager characteristics. Some highish yeasty notes and a little too hop-forward for my liking too. Mouthfeel is nowhere near where it needs to be for the style - weak.

This is a VERY smooth, restrained and rounded version of the style. Usually I'm not a huge fan of the hop-based American versions of BW's, nor am I much of a fan of any kind of oak, but this combo really melds VERY well. It's my suspicion that over the last few months this may have evened-out some. There is a really large and continuing sugary note which makes the huge ABV and any oak notes that would be otherwise be potentially harsh, round out nicely.

BA pghlee at The Brick Store gave me a sneak taste of this a couple of weeks ago, now I get a chance to have a proper crack at it.
Pour is almost black with about 3/4 of an inch of frothy, light head. Mocha colored. On the pour at least the beer seems quite carbonated and fizzy. Things settle down to give some nice lace and a classic, spotty, creamy surface on the beer.
Nose gives the lightly, tart fruit that one would expect from the cherries and a very light touch of funk.
The tastes give a light, blue cheese funk up front and some more light acidity. A bit like balsamic vinegar but not at all that harsh. The back-end and finish is where the cherries kick in. REAL, non-sweetened cherries with a gentle, tart note. More blue cheese in the aftertaste.
Very tasty but you have to be in the mood for a slightly funky Belgian Dark. This is not a classic, dark fruity, rich, sweet Belgian since the cherries add a touch of funk and the blue cheese note. Pretty interesting and not an everyday Belgian for me (since I prefer a more classic Belgian Dark), but catch me in the right mood and I'll enjoy it."

The addition of vanilla beans in the fermentation of our Porter makes this dark but smooth treat that much more dynamic in your mouth.

Pour is a close to colorless/pale lemon until the last pour which yielded some sediment that thickened the appearance and the body considerably.
A lot of things in-line with the style here from the spritzy and lively carbonation, through to the apple-like tartness and the easy of drinking. Delighted to able able to drink a serious, American craft beer in a style that demands an ABV below 5%. That in itself was a great change of pace.
Some green apple skins and an obiovus light acidity make the beer complete. Not quite as tart as I was expecting, and for that alone this beer was extremely drinkable. It is a small departure in terms of the style, and in some respects I think it is best left to the original brewers in the original place to get the full-effect of a beer like this. There is definitely something lost by not being at the source. Having said that, this still drank nicely and I think, whilst although slightly off-base in terms of FULL authenticity (how could it possibly be otherwise?), it did a pretty decent job.
ABV a BONUS! With so little, high quality LOW ABV craft beer produced in America, I have to take what I can get."

About 14 months old by now.
Nose seems stronger than ever (in a good way). The carbonation is still quite prickly, and I think this is probably the weakest part of the beer, but paradoxically it lends a pretty lively element to the beer, and I would rather be it that way than the other, Still fruity and rich, the value here is indisputable. Yeasty elements seems a little higher than originally.
Super beer.

Trader Joe's have been in Atlanta for about three years, but this is the first time I've seen the Vintage &#8206;Ale in the stores here. They told me that they've had it once before but I've never been able to find it. &#8206;It comes in pretty small amounts and disappears very quickly. I love Unibroue so this is a real treat.&#8206;
&#8206;$4.99 for the 750 mL bottle, INCREDIBLE value.&#8206;
Dark, dark brown (essentially black) body with a fizzy head that fades quickly to leave a lovely mocha &#8206;film and spotty lace on the surface of the beer. Looks great.&#8206;
Nose is very rich with plenty of plum and dark fruits but also a sense of some medicinal aniseed.&#8206;
As expected the tastes reflect the nose with a combination of all of the rich, dark fruits that one would &#8206;expect and a decent dose of the Belgian candy, yeast and fruity sugar one would expect. In addition &#8206;we get some medicinal notes of juniper and aniseed which add to the experience. Alcohol present but &#8206;not oppressive.&#8206;
Perhaps a touch prickly in the mouth but it's trivial.&#8206;
Very rich, moreish and basically a fantastic beer. MUCH less ""Dubbel"" (as originally in the BA database, but subsequently changed) &#8206;and more Belgian Strong Dark.&#8206;
Super beer, massively drinkable and fantastic value as usual for Unibroue. Delighted by it.&#8206;"

Pour is a deeper orange color than I was expecting. Considering the ABV and the style, the head and lace are good and in that respect this looks better than I was expecting.
The nose is VERY, VERY alcoholic and banana liquer-like. Bubble-gum too.
The whole feel is like a cross between an Imperial Pilsner, a large Weizenbock and a fairly hot wheat beer of some description. Slick in the mouth but NOT as oily as the ABV would suggest. More huge bananas and alcoholic wheat based bubble-gum.
The drinkability is very good, but the alcohol restricts consumption in the final analysis.

Pour is a very, very dark chestnut brown approaching black. Initially the head is very high but this fades to a thin, mocha, spotty impressive film. Not much lace but that's OK considering the ABV. This is a good looking beer. To be honest the carbonation seemed a touch high for the style and there was a light prickle in the mouthfeel that although not troublesome, again seemed a touch out of line with the traditional aspects of the style.
Some fruity bread in the nose.
There's a surprising amount of licorice and burned character here. Some charcoal and a fair dose of alcohol as well, but also some fruity acidity. It's a bit of a crazy mix. There is indeed some Belgian dark character, but there is also some Belgian based stout notes as well. I guess the Belgian stout flavor is the cocoa nibs coming through. I don't get much nutty flavor from the pecans though. Some sweet and sour in the finish as well. Even a touch of lactose milk stout. Interesting mix!
Interesting, and a really nice beer that you should try if you get the chance, BUT it does push ""Belgian Dark"" a little too far for me. It's there (or thereabouts), but it's at the extremes of the style for me and in that respect, although I really liked it there are quite a few in the style that I would choose before it."

I *think* that this is currently being included in the Sam Adams Winter 12 pack - GOD knows why - it doesn't belong there and it's a bloody liberty by BBC to put his beer in that mixer - out of order, STOP it! Marketing RULES in the USA!
Pour gives a decent, hazed, honey colored body with a high white head and some really good lace in the Southampton Weizen glass. Good looker.
Nose is largely neutral and really only gives a touch of sweetness and certainly minimal citrus from any kind of lemon.
Wheat based tastes that surprisingly lack any depth of lemon. Sure, there is a crispness about the beer, and sure it seems refreshing (if somewhat unseasonal), but the citrus notes remain largely a mystery to me. There is some sweet, very light caramel of perhaps a little butterscotch, but the lemon is lost on me.
Rounded nicely in the mouth and quite satisfying,

So far I've been pretty unimpressed with the recent Heavy Seas/Clipper City bomber offerings, with the DIPA being especially poor and the Pumpkin and Marzen not really setting the house on fire either, so I approach this with a bit of trepidation. I feel a little more optimistic about Yule Tide, since I love a good Tripel and this is the kind of beer that should sit well at the elevated 10% ABV level - we'll see.
Pour is a golden orange which is a touch darker than I usually like for the style. Even though I'm not expecting huge things with this ABV, the head and lacing are a touch disappointing to me.
Nose is pure candied sugar with a touch of alcohol.
The alcohol is pretty well hidden with plenty of bubble-gum and other estery fruits. It's a little ill-defined for me with lots of obvious, syrupy fruit and alcohol but it seems a bit muddled. Lacks definition and any kind of serious edge for a classic style.
Once again this misses for me. With the seemingly ever increasing frequency of these 22 oz releases, the feeling I get is that Clipper City is rushing these beers out to somehow capitalize on the relative popularity of craft beer. I just feel as though they are off target which is surprising and disappointing given how much I like Below Decks and Hang Ten. I'm a bit disillusioned to be honest."

Nose and tastes reveal what I would call a brown ale with spice. As usual the spices are difficult to pinpoint exactly, but certainly some all-spice and a touch of citrus peel/orange. Despite the obvious spice, the beer actually holds its own as a brown ale quite strongly. Malt backbone holds up nicely and the spices come in gentle waves rather than a massive assault - in that respet it is a relatively subtle beer.

I've passed on this a few times at the store, finally took the plunge when the stock seemed to go down to the last bottle. Van Steenberge is solid, so thought I should go ahead.
Pour is very impressive. Firstly the beer pops with a healthy blast and the gunsmoke is good. The color is a deep orange with just the right amount of cloudiness. Even more impressive is the head. Bone white and fantastically sticky and persistent, especially on the surafce of the beer. Greaty spotty surface foam.
Nose is the weakest part for me, which gives some of that musty, old beer nose. Luckily this is not carried over to the taste in any significant way. Quite creamy in the mouth (perhaps not as profound as some in the style), but holds its own. Light alcohol, light sugar and spice too. Finishes strong by bringing all of those elements together. Mild prickle in the back end.
Classic Tripel? Perhaps not, a bit softer than many in the style but still drinks well.
Tasty and a nice beer to replace wine and could act as an aperitif."

Pour is a dark, chestnut body with some frothy lace sitting on the surface. Little lace, but as expected for the ABV.
Surprisingly smooth drinking given the alcoholic content. The beer is very sweet (obviously as a function of the syrup), but also maintains a decent balance of flavors without losing the plot. Alcohol is very well hidden until the back end when it kicks in slightly. Hop profile is lowish
Definitely a light, woody note and some well worn leather in there too. The beer is actually more rounded than I expected and comes together in quite a gentle way considering the complicated array of ingredients. A little medicinal and organic, and a pronounced leafy or earthy tone in there as well. Hay?
I was surprised at how accessible this was as I was expecting an assault on the senses that would be too aggressive. Having said that I don't know that the price, ABV or type of beer that this is will lend itself to anything other than the very occasional tipple.

The pour is a classic, American DIPA orange body with good clarity and plenty of thick, high, white, fluffy head. Lacing is extremely good considering the ABV.
Nose and tastes give that oily, sinus clearing, hop-resin note that are reminiscent of something from the other coast. Sweetness is there, but under control and hops run riot as one would expect them too. A touch of oil in the character and plenty of tangy perfume notes.
A really nice beer if you are looking for your hop fix, but it's not a craving that I get very often so I will probably not drink this much in the future. If you are a hop-head that needs this kind of thing on a regular basis then be prepared to put this into your regular rotation.

It appears as though people are paying a LOT more for this beer around the country. It had LITERALLY been just entered into the Green's system, so perhaps it will be adjusted upward in time. I certainly wouldn't want to pay more than I did, though.
Poured into the Southampton Weizen glass, the beer gives a nice head initially but to be honest it fades rather quickly and delivers very little lace. Requisite clouded butterscotch color in the body. 
The nose yields mainly what one would expect considering the beer that this is supposed to be. Slight solvent alcohol with those tell-tale, non-descript spices.
The beer ""dies"" in the glass really quickly with the initial, short lived, vibrant feel lost to a syrupy, hot alcohol unbalanced feel much too soon. It gets edgy, a touch rough (as in, ""malt liquor/homeless rough"") and generally gets a little classless at an alarming rate. Wits really don't need to be amped up, and at the best of times American craft brewers tend to butcher subtle styles with excess alcohol and big notes, so when left to one of the big boys things go downhill much faster.
Solvent alcohol increases quickly and the spices are lost in the mix. The banana and clove notes become barely relevant as the beer starts to resemble a cross between Steel Reserve and rubbing alcohol.
I dunno, things started well, and I don't dislike Blue Moon, but getting American brewers involved with subtle styles can be a big mistake and coupling the BMC angle the whole thing drops off rapidly. Shame.

Mild gusher. Honey colored poured with a spotty head and a medium amount of head and retention.
Nose and tastes give some simple yeast, a light note of citrus fruit and then some sweeter honey and pineapple notes. Rounded and smooth and the finish even offers the very slightest hint of acidity/funk.
Very slight dying note in the aftertaste and a touch of metal finish the beer.

This was described to me as a Winter Ale, is in the BA db as I type as a Schwarzbier, and frankly looks and drank like neither!
In essence there are some fairly significant chocolate malts which fade to give a malt dominated, mild beer with a tiny, tiny hop kick in the finish. Basically it sits somewhere between an American and an English Brown Ale without any frills.

Quite a large dose of lemony funk in the nose with a touch of soap too.
Tastes are milder than the nose might suggest. Sweeter notes combine with the soapy citrus flavors to even things out a bit. Finish accentuates the soap character. Aftertaste also has a very bitter parts to it as well. A little more pine sol character too.

What I've also said about the GB Marzen when drunk on the premises, is that is has a great, sweet, HIGH yeast feel to it which adds hugely to it's drinkability. This bottled version seems to lack a number of those attrivbutes, and for me REALLY strongly highlights the difference between bottled beer and a (perhaps) fresher kegged version.
The usual bright, clear, sharp look seems to be missing from this version, although the color is similar. The lively yeast also seems a little missing, and the carbonation is less satisfying. Drinks OK, but I can't help wishing that I was drinking a kegged version at the brewpub. It just doesn't quite work as well for me."

The beer drinks decidedly flat as well which is a bit of problem for me. Tasted a bit like one might expect a ""rough round the edges"" homebrew in the style would come out.
Looking for a bright, vibrant angle in this style and to be honest this failed to deliver. Authentic tastes, and perhaps the potential to be better than this experience, but to be honest I was ultimately disappointed. The beer seemed drab, and lacking an edge."

Been holding on to this for a few months, tonight was the night to crack it open. Into the Terrapin snifter in a number of pours.
Simple stuff on the pour; black as night, mocha head, medium in size. Simple and as expected.
Nose at first gives a bready like aroma but this soon gives way to a quite aggressive, medicinal hop base against a background of a touch of solvent alcohol.
This beer drinks very harshly despite the few months of age on it. Light alcohol solvent, mild burn on the way down and a very strong, medicinal, hop-resin type taste that sits poorly with me. Ultimately this is an extrememely bitter beer which surprised me a bit. Smuttynose often brews better, more rounded beer. This was just astringent and lacked any degree of subtlety.
A touch hot (which I can handle), but to be honest the greenish, raw hop profile really turned me off. American Double Stout in my book, MUCH more so than a sweeter, more rounded RIS. For that reason, although the beer is certainly not *bad* as such, it was disappointing. Quite a lot of citrus grapefruit bitterness which I thought may have subsided a bit since bottling. Quite harsh.
If you are looking for a RIS in the classic, sweeter, English origin mold, then this is NOT it."

Pour is a surprisingly ORANGE color which the requisite hazed body. Color definitely forms a distinct orange (rather than yellow color that is often the case in Wits). Head is surprisingly disappointing and poorly retained for the style. As a result lace is minimal. Normally one can expect a really decent, rocky, white cap on Wit's but this one does not deliver very well in that department.
Fruity and lightly acidic nose and tastes rather than spice based. The tangerine notes come through quite strong and the fruit builds as the beer warms slightly. The relative lack of spice is surprisingly, and is largely replaced by serious fruits. I like it, but it seems a touch atypical for the style.
Very drinkable and light in the mouth.
I enjoyed this very much, found it refreshing and sharp/tart, but it seemed low on spice which may disappoint so when they consider the style. All in all it didn't matter to me, so I still rate this beer as a decent Wit, IF a little at the edges of the style."

Pour is a surprisingly light, golden orange body with creamy spotty head. Better head than I had expected considering the ABV and the style. Very lively, bright and impressive appearance for a beer of the style and with some age on it.
Nose has a large sweet element amongst the very rounded, soft bourbon element.
Tastes are an interesting amalgam of English and American Barleywine style. English seems to dominate for me at first with plenty of sweetness upfront. Strong brown sugar character and lots of sweet, mild bourbon tastes. After that, and in the back end, there is a more pronounced American element with some dry tobacco, greater alcohol, some mild burn and then some distinct hop bitterness. Oak is pretty subtle, or at least as subtle as any such beer is ever likely to get. Smooth. Honey builds and comes with a touch of champagne dryness.
Despite this, overall the beer really does seem mild, sweet and somewhat atypical for an American version of a barrel-aged beer of ANY description.
Overall I was surprised at the gentle touch this beer had. Normally I'm not a fan of either American Barleywines or oak-aged beer, but this pulls it off nicely with a with a subtlety that is unusual.

Nose is maasive (again) hugely malty and sweet, followed by a tiny, medicinal, herbal hop finish.
Much the same is experienced in the tastes. This largely feels like an English, relatively sweet stout until the very back end of the taste where the herbal hop notes come crashing in. Alcohol is well hidden. The herbal and medicinal notes build over the course of the beer and get a touch annoying at the end, but to be honest this is the American character coming through.

Alcohol is fairly well hidden and I might have said that it was more in the 7-8% range rather than 10%. Simple roasted flavors, touches of alcohol and a fairly large dose of licorice make up the body of the beer. Smooth in the mouth and rather drinakble.
A creamy beer that I enjoyed very much, and even more as the bottle warmed. Oddly, the next day I noticed that I had left about 3 oz in the bottom of the bottle and I drank it with about 24 hours exposure to the elements on it. It showed no signs of noticeable oxidation (obviously some MUST have taken place), and it still had a decent amount of carbonation! Sign of a well made beer?

Last time I drank this it was directly from the tank, at the brewery, on a trip to Asheville, NC back in April of this year. Obviously nothing could be fresher than THAT, but I'm curious to see how this is now.
Color is very much like the label with yellow (rather than gold) being the order of the day. Definitely different to a typical macro lager that would give that golden color. Some chill haze is apparent. Head is small and not particularly well-retained, but still manages to leave some thin, watery lace.
Whaet notes in the nose; quite strong.
Tastes are fairly neutral but gives some simple acidity, a touch of bitterness from the rye but ultimately adds up to a very clean, refreshing, simple drink. Massively quaffable and still hits the spot here in Georgia since the temperatures have been in the 70's on these last few November days!

Nose and tastes reveal some pretty strong west-coast style, grapefruit astringency with an additional fair amount of residual sugar and bitterness. Resinous feel about the beer as one would expect. Alcohol is there too.
As usual for the style, the hop profile fatigues the palate extremely quickly and even at the end of the pint I've had enough, no chance of drinking any more of these.
What can I say that hasn't already been said about hundreds of similar, good quality DIPA's? - Another solid version of the style by a solid brewer, but ultimately this is just a little run-of-the-mill and not a beer that stands out in the myriad of similar brews out there. Well done, but how about something else in a style less well covered by brewer's like Avery?

I didn't bother to read the label in detail before I bought this so I just assumed it would be another, spiced Christmas Ale. That's OK, since I really enjoy that type of beer, so imagine my surprise when I started to drink the beer and then read the reviews on BA.
Appearance is a lovely, tawny, clear brew with a decent head that has some lace and retention. The nose and tastes reveal what I thought were initially a cherry-like essence but when I started to read the reviews the peach dd start to make more sense.
The interesting thing about the beer is that it build to a malty, lightly bitter finish and it has some fairly serious biscuit like malts in the finish. The ending is almost, almost, English ESB-like. Tasty.

Mid brown body with a viscous murkiness about it. The mouthfeel is very smooth. To be fair, it is a smoothness that is born out of a little, cloying sweetness, but at the same time it does go down easily. Sugary 
It's certainly very sweet with the alcohol fairly well hidden, and in that respect this is nothing like an American BW and much more like an English version of the style.

The next odd thing is that there really is hardly any smoke here at all. Not in the nose or the tastes. It ""sort of"" appears a touch, but this could be because of the roasted malts as much as anything else. Not smoky by virtally any standard.
Very rich in the mouth wil plenty odf silky smoothness. I anm curious as to the ABV since this drink in a manner that suggests it's really quite high, but the tastes don't burn or create much evidence to suggest it is really big.

Nose is a strong point with lots of rich, biscuit based malts. Some stinky hops!
Tastes are classic, if a little dry. Finish even gives a touch of puckering bitterness in a classic, English hop-based manner but drier than many. It's all subtle, simple and passive aggressive which will be way beyond the comprehension of many American palates. Lots of pale malts are upfront that hold their own.
This beers falls slap bang into the usual categories that one finds with bottled English Bitters that are imported to the USA, namely;
 + Would be infinitely better on cask, close to the source
 + Simple, subtle hop profile will be under-appreciated in the USA
 + Low ABV, malt base will be under-appreciated in the USA
Light , easy drinking for the warmer weather I would say. Outside of that not much to report, I really like it*, many Americans won't.

Pours with a bright, bright golden body, a decent head and amazingly clarity. Normally I'm a huge fan of such clarity but to be honest I expect my Tripel's to lack some that and have a least a degree of chill-haze about them. Surprised at the clear nature of the beer.
Nose reveals some typical bubblegum notes.
The tastes are essentially ALL, massive, sweet, sugar! There isn't really the slightly spiced, Belgian yeast notes that one would normally associate with the style. All Tripel's need that high level of sweetness, but this seems extraordinarily so; this is coming from me who likes sweetness, and even considering that the style demands a good degree of it. As I drink it I'm thinking that this could give me a TERRIBLE headache and hangover! As the beer settles and warms there is a touch more of the other attributes that one might expect for the style, but ultimately they can't really compete with the cloying sweetness. I think it just goes slightly beyond where it needs to be.
Not bad, but a tad unbalanced for me. Not 100% sure about the body clarity or the level of sugar that we get here,; it seems at the VERY edges of what is acceptable. I might visit this again but I suspect that it would be in small doses."

Boxed bottle from Hop City, Atlants, GA, USA.
Pour is a murky brown, Dubbel-like body that lacks much head or lace, but does leave some spotty cream on the surface of the beer.
Plenty of very sweet malts in the nose but not much else.
The tastes are certainly malty but they lack much cherry character, at least any specific cherry character. There IS a fruit note in the finish but as for it being cherry, well, I dunno it does not seem distinctive to me at all. The oaking also seems largely lacking which I feel is a good thing but there is a modicum of dry character in the finish which could be as a result of the oak. More sweet malts continue to build which I like, and it is somewhat appropriate for the style, but the alcohol doesn't really make it to the level it should fro a Doppelbock and the distinct nature of the style also doesn't seem to make it through to the palate. It's a little weak in terms of its presence.
I'm not sure, but it seems like a poor Doppelbock, not very fruit based and hardly oaked; Not good signs for a ""Cherry, Oaked Doppelbock!"
"New Belgium Brewing","La Folie","","","Flanders Red Ale","6.0%","bottle","4.1","4","4","4","4","4.5","11/1/09","Part of the new wave of Lips of Faith releases, this one in the silk-screened, Lips of Faith series as a 22 oz bottle rather than the corked and caged affairs of years past. I bet the purists are saying, ""it's just not the same"". Having not tasted this until now, I can't possibly comment on that so this review is just based on what's in the glass now. A good thing I feel.
For me, the temperature of this style is absolutely fundamental and crucial. Warming, as it does naturally in the glass, produces rounded notes that help the initially shocking start to the beer, even out.
Beer initially produces a lot of fizz, but the carbonation ultimately produces zero head and lace. Pretty much as expected for the style, the beer settles to have the carbonation qualities (at least in terms of appearance) of a flat, ""fizzy"" drink. The mouthfeel carbonation is a little more lively but not much. Color is a brownish, gravy-like hue. Not attractive at all, but pretty much as expected for the style.
Nose gives that typical, mild sinus clearing vinegar element that passes through the senses quite quickly. Obviously some cider notes as well. A touch of caramel.
Tastes are pretty much spot on for the style. Light vinegar in that builds and reaches a crescendo in the finish. Aftertaste lingers for a moment. Although it sounds a bit damning, there isn't much else to report. Actually that is meant as a compliment. As it warms it mellows (as predicted) and becomes increasingly drinkable.
To me, as good as many (but not all) Belgian originals, this really is an excellent example of the style. Requisite vinegar but well within parameters."

Always look forward to the annual offering, and given the GA alcohol limit we are getting close to the end of things we will see locally!
22 oz bottle that came from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour is dark brown body with some red highlights. The head is initially good with a mocha colored hue, and considering the ABV has decent retention and lace. Not the greatest, but the ABV always hits this aspect quite hard.
Nose has more than a touch of solvent alcohol and some burned malts.
The carbonation and mouthfeel both have a presence (highish and thinnish) that don't really match with the Imperial Stout designation. For that reason I might consider this in the American Strong Ale category instead. Alcohol is certainly there and burns a touch on the way down. Although this is STILL a hugely malted beer, it has more hop presence (in terms of bitterness) than we have been used to from Shmaltz.
Tastes reveal some really large licorice. Definitely the largest element of the the competing tastes. More alcohol and light charcoal in the back end. Coats the mouth and teeth quite substantially.
A VERY robust beer and definitely an interesting candidate for some age IMO. This feels REALLY young at the moment. Glad to see the brewery pushing some boundaries both in general terms AND in terms of getting out of their OWN comfort zone. Good stuff, but to be honest a little raw right now. Stick some in the cellar."

Nose is surprisingly muted and lacks much of any discernable coffee notes.
Tastes are essentially very bitter, and not really in a good way. One might expect this to reflect some bitter coffee-grinds but that's not the bitterness I am really getting. It's a much more cigar, tobacco, leathery bitterness, not that pleasant. In addition the coffee is basically non-existant.
I would love to try this fresh just to see if the coffee is really part of the profile which has now faded, or if it was never there in the first place. Given the name, it was disappointing that it was not there. Either this beer is not a very good coffee based stout, or it simply doesn't age well."

Very strong, even ""artificially"" so; plenty of bubblegum aromas and a lot of sticky sweetness. BIG estery fruits and plenty of alcohol too. Now, of course, all of this is completely in order for the style, including (to an extent) the slick mouthfeel, but to be honest it seems a little floral and overpowering. The combination seems a bit unbalanced, slightly awkward and rather clumsy.
This is another of the newer, GD, 22 oz packaged beers that is really odd. I've been a great fan of GD in the past but this relatively new crop (the Dunkelweisse, Saison, Double Wit) has been very hit and miss with some crude tastes that have highlighted huge sweetness and alcohol.

Pour is as expected, meaning that we get a clear gold colored liquid with a white head that disappears almost immediately. Virtually no lace. Some nasty looking sediment.
Nose and tastes give a curious lemony, sweetish, soapy sensation that lingers. Watery in terms of the mouthfeel and a plastic like sweetness comes into the picture.

Nose gives a lot of apple acidity that is quite noticeable. It also has a fairly large whiff of manure/wet horse-blanket. 
Interestingly enough, most of the funk goes away in the taste. There is a touch of cider in the back end, but the beer is not a funky one at all. Some yeast also comes into the picture along with some more typical large malt presence that one would expect from a beer in the style of a Biere de Mars/Garde. There is also some spice notes with a touch of white pepper but also some extra dry metallic notes.
I must admit I'm a bit confused as o what New Belgium is trying to do here. I think an American Wild Ale is a huge stretch, and perhaps better would be a Biere de Garde. At the same time it has some cider like notes. Strange beast and not really especially drinkable either. Finishes a little to dry and the whole thing doesn't sit all that well.

Nose and tastes give a LOT of sweetness and some bitterness that is characterized by some chicory. Definitely reminds me of the old Camp Coffee! 
The sweetness is noticeable as it rings up some lactose sweetness as well. Perhaps even feels a touch infected, as if the sweetness is just about to go sour. these competing notes are held together with some dryish chocolate as well. 
Alcohol is extremely well hidden. A bit of fruit, but the overwhelming feeling was that of a slightly rancid, milk sugar sweetness. Interesting.
Very drinkable and the alcohol seems almost absent when considering the numbers that are on the label.
Not really a classic RIS, more of an Imperial Milk Stout for me. You've really got to enjoy the sweeter side of things to enjoy this beer and luckily I do."

Nice, mocha colored head on top of the usual dark brown, garnet body. Head is maintained nicely &#8206;and the lace is nicely broken on the glass and firm on the surface. 
&#8206; 
The nose is surprisingly muted for the OSA. Normally one gets plenty of herbal spices but after a &#8206;year this seems muted somewhat. 
&#8206; 
Tastes are also less spicy than some have been in the past. A decent amount of licorice bitterness &#8206;that includes a touch of winter spice, but the whole package seems less aggressive than in years &#8206;gone by, even taking into account the year of age that's already on this. 
&#8206; 
Finishes with a touch more sweetness and perhaps a whiff of orange peel. Spice finally comes in &#8206;with the aftertaste. 
&#8206; 
Creamy in the mouth (as usual), the 2008 vintage is less spiced than many others and the age &#8206;seems to have driven that fact home even further.

I ordered the beer at The Porter in Little Five, Atlanta, GA, &#8206;USA. A few minutes later I was joined by a friend of mine who knows very little about beer and &#8206;started engaging the barman about what to order and drink. As part of this conversation the &#8206;barman started offering advice about brown ales but he did NOT mention the Starfish in that &#8206;category. I was curious since it was a CLASSIC brown ale, and it was sitting in front of me, and &#8206;he had poured it for me about 2 minutes earlier. When I asked him what he thought the beer was &#8206;he said ""a strong chocolate ale""! Mmmm...I guess that's the last advice I'd be seeking from him. &#8206;Especially disappointing since he said that he had worked at The Porter since its opening. Oh &#8206;well, it's what I've become accustomed to. 
&#8206; 
Back to the beer. A classic, English style brown ale in most respects. Good depth on the color &#8206;with a nice head and good lace. The body was about right for the style and some classic, lightly &#8206;toasted malts, some digestive biscuit crumbs and sweetness. Very easy drinking and the beauty &#8206;of a beer like this is its simplicity.

I'm not an enormous fan of smoked beers in general, BUT it could be argued that if you are &#8206;going to smoke anything, the Imperial Porter would be a great candidate.

Pour is impresive. Black with a few reddish highlights and a SOLID head. The head looks like a &#8206;piece of bread, and is well sustained and produces some beautiful lace. 
&#8206; 
Sweet, light smoke makes up the nose. 
&#8206; 
The tastes obviously reflect the smoke, and we get the typical Imperial Porter, sweet roast notes, &#8206;but in addition there is some sharp, hop based bitterness as well. In the back end (not quite the &#8206;finish) there is also a fairly strong dose of chocolate - THAT, I was not expecting. The alcohol is &#8206;really quite strong and cumulative. Warming on the way down. 
&#8206; 
VERY easy drinking and a really tasty brew. I wasn't looking for quite so much bitterness (I am &#8206;creamy, sweet, smooth Porter kind of guy), but to be truthful it seemed in place and melded &#8206;beautifully. 
&#8206; 
I think the beers' context is quite important; it's autumn in GA, and although it NEVER gets &#8206;really cold here, there is a coolness in the air that makes this a PERFECT beer to help me grill &#8206;gourmet burgers on the deck. Absolutely hits the spot. Impressive beer on many levels."

Pour gives a crystal clear, orange body with some wispy lace and head which ultimately settles to &#8206;give a thin white film on top of the beer. Looks nice, a bit like lucozade. Similar to the orginal.

Nose has a touch of liquor about it but many a clean edge of alcohol.

The tastes are malty and alcohol laden. Drinks very cleanly with a solvent-like finish that again is &#8206;well defined. Not much depth here, the beer drinks a little like a liquer. Warming alcohol on the &#8206;second and third gulp. Some estery fruits as well, but the beer still maintains a level of solvent &#8206;above and beyond the fruit character. 

&#8206; 

I dunno, not much point to this methinks as the beer stands quite well on its own. This version &#8206;seemed a lot less hoppy (in terms of much less grapefruit) but it did maintain some pretty good &#8206;definition and clean lines. I'm happy with the original origin though."

Some extra yeast (as expected) as the style demands it IMO. &#8206;Here's the deal, I am delighted that the rye essentially does NOT show up - that's GOOD for me - &#8206;but it seems as though its effect is to diminish the sweet malt character of the beer a little. It's not &#8206;a HUGE problem since we still get plenty of Marzen like notes, but it is not quite as sweet, clear &#8206;and as well defined as most. Why the rye?? 
&#8206; 
The truth here is that the rye doesn't detract too much from the Marzen, but WHY have it AT all? &#8206;I don't get it. The rye only serves to makes this a slightly less good Marzen than it otherwise &#8206;would be - confusing.

750 mL bottle from Mac's, Atlanta, GA, USA. 
Pour gives a slightly burned orange color with plenty of floaties and some murky character. Nose reveals a little funk which is magnified in the taste. Head, lace and retention all poor. No gusher here as others have reported, perhaps earlier carbonation issues have been sorted or just difference in batches.
The tastes remind me a little of Orval. One would think that was a good thing, and it may be, but I am not a huge fan of Orval so it doesn't do much for me. That light funk is in there with some sweetness. In fact it goes a bit sweet and sour on my palate. Carbonation seems a touch high when held against the background of a ""thinnish"" body. Prickly.
To me this is at the edges of what a Saison should be. It lacks the classic notes of spice, and instead delivers more of a Wild Ale/Sour WITH added hops; I bet that many will enjoy and like this, but to me takes something away from the beer. A little too far away from the classic style for me.
Decent, and a solid beer, but not really what I'm looking for in a Saison and as a result a beer that I doubt I will go back much, if at all."

Having read some of the previous reviews I decided to open this over the sink and use the 500 mL Tucher Weizen glass as a precaution since I was half expecting a huge gusher and beer everywhere. As it happened, that was not necessary, however it did produce a large amount of annoying foam in the glass. ""Well carbonated"" I would say, but in some ways appropriate.
Hazed, yellow body with great head but not fantastic retention or lace considering the carbonation.
Lemongrass and mild citrus dominate the nose and the tastes and there is a touch of coriander etc. but for me it is VERY muted. Bubbly carbonation continues to produce nice burps and plenty of light, gassy mouthfeel. Almost to the point of feeling champagne like in terms of the body, the beer settles to give a very lemony Wit experience. More lemony that most in the style, and although I did enjoy it the beer is fairly one dimensional.
Delighted to have a sensible ABV in a 750, and in that respect I really enjoyed the beer. Perhaps a strange time of year to be releasing this beer into a new market, especially alongside Autumn Maple, but nevertheless enjoyable and tasty.
Happy to have another beer in one of my preferred styles and happy to have a sensible amount of alcohol in a 750. All in all very heavy on the lemon, lacked a lot of spice notes but I still enjoyed it with ease. Good crossover potential here for newbies."

Nice malty nose with little nut character but nevertheless sweet and in line with the style.
Simple, tasty, well-crafted a no-nonsense, no frills beer and that's a GOOD thing. In the USA, FAR too often these days it is difficult to track down quality examples of simple, low ABV malt based styles. In that respect this is a God-send. Simple finish with a very moreish character. A touch earthy. Coats the mouth nicely, and has a good taste presence.
A touch thin in the mouth, but perhaps this is a reflection upon the organic angle.

Pour is a pretty bright, darkish bronze color but at the same time not quite as dark as I was expecting. Head is good and fades to give a lovely, creamy, spotty film on the surface of the brew. Classic look.
Nose and tastes give plenty of layered Belgian candy, winter spices and alcohol. The spice is very prominent with a cinnamon pumpkin feel being right up there at the front. If the coriander, orange and cardamon come together I guess that they could produce that....right...?
A little prickle in the mouthfeel from the carbonation and some warming alcohol in the finish. A little Madeira and Bristol Cream sherry add to the depth and the warmth. Nutmeg and mace notes increase in their intensity.
Although the alcohol is pretty well hidden, it still makes its presence felt, and the beer feels full, present and significant.
Increasing sweetness with a touch of burned sugar in the character as well.

I was NOT looking forward to this because I am not a fan of rye at all. HOWEVER, there is absolutely ZERO rye character present - I mean NONE! I guess that may disappoint some people, but for me it was the exact opposite - delighted!
It's quite difficult to describe this beer as a whole. The best I could some up with was a sweet and sour medicinal experience. Not sure if that makes much sense, but it's the best I could muster. Very light cherry note with a light herbal quality too. The beer is clean and sharp with a mild tartness, but NOT in the form of funk - much more in an light acidic manner. At the same time it imparts a fruity sweetness. Definite light cherry esters. Moreish, sweet and smooth as can be.

In general, Pennichuck's entry to the Atlanta market has been really quite underwhelming. I'm a huge fan of simple beers, but simple is NOT an excuse for a lucklustre quality.
WOW - this is an EXTRAORDINARY color and pour. A dark, dark, dark brown that is approaching black and reminds me of an English mild. Head is high and tight with a tan color and good lace. Dense.
Nose and tastes give a less impressive (but stil solid) experience with malts taking the lead. The beer seems to lack the classic dry character of an Irish Red and plenty of sweet malts keep coming through including in the sftertaste. Smooth finish and decent beer that could (just) be a sessionable candidate.
The preponderance of malt gives this a much greater brown ale presence than perhaps anyone intended, but if I were doing a blind taste I would say this is closer to a malty brown ale than anything ""red"". Not especially dry and the sweet malts do tend to come through.
Best Pennichuck effort that I've had so far. Not saying a great deal, but nevertheless true. Much work to be done by this brewery in my eyes, but at least a little faith has been restored."

Ho hum, on to this one. label suggests a five year window for cellaring which is all well and good, but unfortunately there is no date stamp to be found on the bottle.
750 mL, slender neck on the 750 mL bottle (looks a litte like the old Jolly Pumpkin bottles) capped. Purchased from Mac's, Atlanta, GA, USA for approx $9 (I didn't actually look at the price).
Seems like the perfect beer for an Autumnal afternoon (or at least as Autumnal as it ever gets in GA), so I have high expectations for this one.
Pour gives a pretty, bronze body with some chill-haze. Head is bubbly and has a nice, tan colored hue. It has a medium density but doesn't leave much lace. Some thin film on the surface.
Nose yields spice but it's all rather non-descript. Nothing obvious in terms of identification for me.
Tastes have plenty of sweetness and a little diacetyl. I suppose that the sweetness is the maple syrup but again it's not especially easy to identify. Some nice, appropriate, mild burn on the way down. Although the label specifically SHUNS pumpkin, the combo does seem to give a pumpkin note!
Finish is where the alcohol comes through, but it still is well below the advertied 10.5%. For that reason I would describe it as well-hidden.
Overall this beer is fine, but not something I can imagne drinking much of. Not a great deal of Belgian character here and Winter Warmers and (unfortunately Buery peeps) pumpkin comes to mind more than anything."

Description precisely as follows;



80% Altanta Brewing Co. 2007 Winter Ale + 20% Atlanta Brewing Co. Brown Ale, then aged in Jack Daniels barrels since 2007. Described by the brewer/brewery as a ""Sour"" and appears on the Brick Store menu as such, BUT only because it seems difficult to classify, and as it has been fermenting away for a couple of years.



Classified in terms of the closest style available on BA, but fairly inaccurate.



Very dark, still, almost black appearance with no head to speak of. Small film of lace on the surface of the beer. Strong, strong bourbon influenced aroma and same in the taste. About as subtle as a beer of this nature can be, with warming but not overpowering alcohol. Initial sweetness fades to give even more warmth and alcohol in the finish.



No sour notes, just simple a bourbon aged, dark ale with a touch of wild nature about it.



Pretty thin in the mouth.



Not bad, but not really my thing. Fine for what is is and at least it was approachable and drinkale without being obnoxious. Drinkability was good considering everything, but not real easy. A little goes a LONG way here."

Beer pours as expected with a dark brown body, very little head and no lace. The color is a bit of a dirty brown dubbel which, as usual I don't find especially attractive. Not surprising, just not especially attractive.
Alcohol hits the nose with plenty of brown sugar notes as well.
The alcohol does not manifest in the taste quite as strongly as the nose would suggest. Yes, it's there, but it's not hot rather it's laid back with a gentle warming sensation and a light sherry, Madeira note. Classicly formed for the style. The alcohol also seems lower than the ABV would suggest. Only slightly warming on the way down without the burn.
Of course, as suspected the beer increases complexity, depth and enjoyment as it warms. It moves into the digestif category.
To be honest, the mouthfeel is slightly prickly, especially for the style and even after it warms a little. It has a bit too much presnt for my liking but it's not a deal breaker.
All in all, with the possible exception of the mouthfeel and the carbonation, the beer fits nicely into the style and does a pretty nice job."

Pour yields a really quite yellow, slightly chill-hazed body with some nice white head. Wispy, light lace. Color changes to a darker he when the final yeast sediment is added from the last pour of the bottle.
The nose gives some fairly typical but rather restrained notes. Yes there is some subtle, peppery, alcohol infused character. Some yeastiness with light esters.
Tastes are pretty authentic for the style too. Alcohol prominent BUT at the same time it still drinks well below the 9.0% ABV on the bottle. Very dry, champagne yeast like finish. A little spice but the usual sharp esters and large pepper notes are muted. Yeast repeats its presence over and over again. Quite smooth, it lacks the prickly nature that the alcohol and carbonation can sometimes impart to the style. 
It's actually quite a reserved beer for the style, but the thing that really shines through for me is the dry character. Some vinous notes too. Pretty interesting and I wasn't sure that Nogne could pull this off but they did."

Nose and tastes are really quite sweet. Bubble-gum, yes, but as others have said, I get a lot of pears too. The beer is very mild and sweet and lacks much of an alcohol edge or anything very distinguishable in the Belgian candy or yeast department.

Aroma is essentially of nothing. Again the circumstances don't help much (served FROZEN), but even on warming we get next to nothing in terms of smell. Perhaps a really, really weak ""wheatish"" whiff?
The taste is best described as neutral. There IS a tiny, feint spice note in the finish but one really has to really struggle to recognize it as such. In a blind taste I'm not sure that I would be able to pick it up.

Pumpkin beers are a strange beast as far as I am concerned, and this is no exception.
Essentially pumpkin products are virtually unknown in England, and when one considers that amount of pumpkin related stuff that is shoved down your throat in the USA, the contrast is really quite stark. Also, given the disappointment that I had with Prosit and the horrible expeience of the Big DIPA (that was almost undrinkable), I'm a touch wary to say the least. I also had Terrapin's Pumpkinfest a couple of nights ago and it sat very poorly with me too.
Pour here yields a very nice, bright orange body with good clarity. Color is great with good depth. Head fades but leaves a little wispy lace.
Nose has the requisite sice elements but also introduces the classic, band-aid phenol as well.
Tastes are not quite as aggressive as the nose may suggest. Light spices but coupled with a dryish, alcohol based finish. Aftertaste is a touch on the solvent side of things with a lingering turn on the extremeties of the tongue. Burns slightly.
A decent pumpkin but these things are just never going to be my favorite. I don't really get them."

In an O'fest I'm looking for a few key characteristics and this beer fell down on several of them.
Firstly I want a really, bright orange hue with outsanding clarity and an observable carbonation. For me this provided none of those and in fact I would decscribe the beer as being ""muddy"" in its appearance. Decent head and lace though which made up the disappointing color and clarity somewhat.
Secondly in terms of taste, I'm seeking that sweet, malt based sharpness with a clean edge. Again there was a muddy character to the taste with too much going on and a much greater dose of hoppy bitterness than I care for in the style.
For me, the beer lacked definition, and that's a big problem in my O'fest's. I'm looking for sharp, clean lines in appearance and taste and this delivered neither of those very well.

Nice depth of color on the pour, but the carbonation seems a little too lively for the style which in turn produces a scant, over-bubbly head and no lace. A shame because the color looked promising. It quickly dies in the glass.
The nose is pretty amazing. It has a deep, sweet malt presence that almost immediately turns into an old, slightly musty sherry note.
The tase reflect that, and have me reaching for the bottle to see if there is a date on it. There isn't, and this hasn't been in the Atlanta market very long so my suspicion is that this is reasonably fresh. Odd beause these are definitely the kind of tastes that one associates with oxidation and older beer. It's not too much of a problem for me since I generally enjoy those sherry-like notes, but I'm not at all sure that it's supposed to be present here in this beer.

Pop on opening is encouraging with a good amount of gunsmoke. Proper carbonation in these beers is vital to their success.
Pour gives a fairly standard (but good looking) appearance with some white, frothy head and some decent lace. Body is a clouded, orange marmalade hue with a little chill haze.
Light pepper, low funk and some Belgian yeast in the nose.
The beer is very dry indeed. Not much funk at all, and the white pepper really provides quite a profound bitterness. It all comes together nicely, but this beer lacks much horseblanket or much grassy or earthy character. In that respect I would not call this a classic Saison by any stretch of the imagination although it is a tasty beer. Some lemon notes in the finish but it still seems more bitter than tart to me.
You're going to have to look past the lack of funk, and to enjoy the beer as more of a Belgian Pale or even a beer that's a little like a Belgian IPA, than a classic of the eponymous style. As it warms there is a greater degree of sweetness but the beer never delivers the traditional funk, nor does it leave that dry note completely behind. The finish still has the bitter bite.
Tasty, but not really a classic in the genre but in a way that really doesn't matter."

The beer is a touch bitter but that fits with the style and links the color to the nose to the taste.
Mouthfeel seems a touch prickly on the carbonation.
Plenty of malts in the taste withe ginger talkng a leading role, but the alcohol seems higher than one might expect when reading the label and the combination of malt and spice starts to overwhelm the palate a bit.

This beer has been described to me in many ways, the most frequent being an ""Imperial Wet Hopped Amber/Red"". Whilst the beer does have the hue of an Amber, AND it does have a nice, wet-hopped presence, when it comes down to it there is little malt/amber presence and the beer falls into a freshly hopped mid-range brew.
I say ""mid-range"", since that for an American hopped beer this is really restrained. There is a degree of similarity between it and an English IPA (with the exception of the ABV).
Dark orange pour that yields a somewhat disappointing head and lace. The nose yields quite gentle hop nose with the emphasis on organic freshness and an edgy grassy nature.
The tastes are really very good. VERY mild in terms of the combination of hops (gentle but assertive) and plenty of sweetness. The sweetness has a real grassy feel to it rather than an Amber malt presence and it is extremely obvious. 
There seems to be a very low level of carbonation but it works very well. Smooth and NON-aggressive, and very drinkable beer. CLEAN and light with a touch of orange.
I was surprised by the gentle touch this beer gave and as such I enjoyed it much more than I thought I would. As a result, I'm going to be one of the BA's that gives this beer one of the higher scores since this beer is subtle and restrained. Not something that is appreciated much around here.
Of course an unnecessarily high ABV. Also, a MORONIC name ultimate reflects the silly, unsophisticated angle that Sweetwater wants to persue, which for me is a great shame."

Pour is a highly carbonated one with a peach colored body. The head is light and slightly fizzy with a very slight (but noticeable pinkish hue). Some head and lace, but the noisy carbonation is the most obvious part of the pour.
Some very light fruit and funk in the nose.
The tastes are quite strongly acidic and the fruit is very reserved. There is a touch of funk but again it is very light. The whole thing seems more like acidic fruit than much else. The carbonation lingers. This is not really a Lambic, nor does in feel like a Saison, nor does it feel like a Wild Ale - it's really a pretty interesting combo of all of the above.
It's pretty easy on the palate and in terms of its drinkability. A nice beer and one that you could perhaps present as an example of something outside of the norm to non-BA's. The funk and the acidity drop off a touch as the beer warms and as the palate gets used to the combo.

This is a VERY odd beer that frankly I don't much care for. I seemed to remember hearing that this was built on an ""original"" or old style recipe for a Porter and if it was I am glad that the style has syubsequently evolved.
The pour yielded a beer that was essentially porter-like, but with the emphasis on brown rathern than black. Head was poor.
Nose was a little non-descript and offered nothing more than a touch of maly sweetness and some typical, roasty notes.
The mouthfeel and tastes are where things started going south for me. Firstly this is basically a very thin Porter. If you want to call it watery then go right ahead, I think that would be appropriate. In terms of the taste there ARE some of the usual Porter characteristics (roasted notes, caramel type malts etc.) BUT the overwhelming experience for me was NUTS! It tasted like someone had taken a whole bunch of crushed hazelnuts and liquidized them. Literally, nuts on top of nuts. I did not like this at all, and thought it was off-putting and basically nasty. It also seemed oddly carbonated for the style.
As I say, IF this is based upon some very old recipes, I am delighted that we have got where we are today with the Porter style as opposed to where were once were.

Pour is a surprisingly red body with a nice high, white rocky head that produces some really nice lace in the glass. Apart from the fact that the body has a rather odd color for an IPA (which may bother some), it looks pretty good.
Nose gives a pretty large dose of resinous, west coast hops with sinus clearing properties. The nose seems really ""green"" and fresh, like a wet-hopped beer.
Tastes reflect the nose but the hops seem a little more citrusy than the nose suggested. Some aggressive grapefruit that doesn't let up much. It's really quite dry and the finish is really quite puckeringly bitter. Lingering coinage metal on the tongue after swallowing. The beer does NOT let up in terms of dry bitterness, and although I didn't feel it up front, by the end of the 24 oz it really begins to feel a touch unbalanced.
Here's the deal with this beer;
I think that the ""estate"" idea a REALLY interesting one and in theory I'm in support of it, BUT there are two significant problems;
(i) This beer that ends up in the glass here is simply NOT that different from umpteen other SN offerings. Take the Anniversary beers, the IPA, the SNPA, Celebration, ESB, Torpedo, the Hop Harvest, Southern Hemi etc. etc., we have LOADS of pretty good (with the exception of the ESB), hop based, IPA style clones that simply DON'T make sufficient distinctions between themselves to make any of them stand out. Ultimately this is just ANOTHER hop-based, SN beer that is not *bad* as such but seems SO run-of-the-mill. In that respect, at least on the first bottling, this experiment/project is a failure. NOW, IF this leads to bigger, better and greater things in the future then I may change my mind but for now the effort (and the extra cost) was simply not worth it! Having said all of that, I would REALLY love the estate idea to take off.
(ii) When you consider my comments in (i) above, AND you realize that this beer costs the equivalent of over $30 per sixer, it makes the whole situation INSANE! I'm NOT debating that the costs involved in producing this beer are higher, but rather I am saying that those extra costs (ultimately passed on to the consumer) are simply TOTALLY unjustified when you consider the product that ends up in the glass. There are countless other beers that will give you the same (or better) experience (some of them by SN themselves!), for less than one-third of the cost. It just doesn't add up - not even close. Maybe one day, but not now.
If I were scoring this in relation to the extra effort relating to what's in the glass, OR the value for money, then it's a CLEAR, F!
In summary I WANT the estate concept to work but if it is going to it will have to produce beers that are much more distinct than this one is. This is not a bad beer, but at an equivalent of $30 a sixer it is a total failure. We'll see..."

Poured into the Tucher Weizen glass, the color is alarmingly light for the style. The pour is largely a macro yellow color and lacks the kind of extra added orange, amber depth that one would expect to find in a Marzen. Strike one.
There is some nice carbonation with plenty of streaming bubbles and some decent head, but the lace and retention are only average.
Tastes are a little corny and little too sweet, malt liquor like for my liking. It lacks much depth or character and there is a distinct absence of those high quality sweet malts that one would normally expect from the style.

Pretty dry with a satisfying finish and aftertaste. a bit more bitterness and dry character than one might expect, but nevertheless very acceptable. Not a beer that packs a huge punch but nor should it be. Nice.
Good, simple stuff with lots of crossover potential."

Deliberately avoided this at Brewgrass as I wanted to try it for the first time, properly. Gold foil on the neck.
No surprise on the pour, a pure black with tan espresso like head. Some lace.
There's actually EXTREMELY little to report here - this is in NO way a complex beer. That doesn't make it *bad*, it just means it is what it is. 
The nose and tastes are basically those chocolate covered espresso beans. A strong, slightly smoked, bitter chocolate based espresso combo and very little else. The coffee is VERY strong, but at the same time it is not oppressive. It really tastes like a very high quality, sweetened espresso. There is very little lactose or milk stout character here for me, rather this is simply liquid chocolate espresso beans.
EXTREMELY light in the mouth too, not remotely viscous and one might even say *thin* when one considers the type of beer this is. In fact it's really only the carbonation (with a touch of warming alcohol) that distinguishes this from BEING coffee. Perhaps that is a bit harsh, after all is is NOT supposed to be an Imperial Stout, but the coffee combo can trick the mind into expecting a much larger beer overall. I think that I may have fallen victim of the American obsession with large eveything!
This is one of the few beers that one can truly consider to be a ""coffee"" beer and not much else. This is SUCH a good ""coffee"" replicator that it might even impress people that DON'T like coffee. Quite a feat to make beer actually BE coffee! Very drinkable, try it with a doughnut or a bagel!"

12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA. Pour is a decent, somewhat frothy, typical for the Helles style yellow. Head was average with some retention and lace.
Nose gives away very little except a touch of smoke and some malty sweetness. The tastes reflect this fairly faithfully but with the smoke playing a larger part. An interesting combination of tastes that frankly struggles a bit to settle on the palate but it's not unpleasant. Definitely would benefit from some snacks alongside this one.
As with smoked beers of ANY description, these are generally complimented with food, the heartier the better.
Overall enjoyable, and although this is obviously not a beer like a smoked porter or even a classic German rauch, it does have a certain autumnal, winter, grilling, BBQ type appeal that might even start a few conversations,. Not bad at all."

2009 Highland Cup Winner, look out for this in the GABF Pro-Am competition.
Poured into the Brewgrass sampler glass in small doses. Solid if unspectacular mahogany body with some nice lace left behind by the mocha head.
Nose has some solid, caramel sugary notes but a lack of much that one would call smoky. Sweetness comes through the more you sniff it.
Tastes are really quite significantly bitter but not in a really unpleasant way. If you were looking for extensive smoke content (which obviously one WOULD be given the presentation), I think that you may be a bit disappointed. The slightly charcoal bitterness was the main feature rather than much smoke. Plenty of roasty malts, but these come through in a stout bitterness kind of manner rather than the smoke angle. Definitely some bitter, bitter chocolate.
Putting aside the lack of real smoke content, this drank very nicely and had a slightly hoppy note which created a distinct bitterness. On a blind taste taste this would resister with my palate as a stout, and the creamy, soft note that I am looking for in my Porters was missing a little. In that respect there are American stamps all over it.
Think edgy, less sweet, less rich Tasgall.
Despite that, the drinkability was good and I enjoyed the beer, just don't expect big ""Rauch"" content and you'll probably enjoy it."

Let me say right off the top that I love sweeter beers and beers that are malt based, BUT....this is a disaster in terms of sweetness and taste.
The look is strong. A really nice clarity to the orange amber body and surprisingly good head, retention and lace considering the style. Rather well carbonated as well and a decent mouthfeel.
The nose reveals a solvent like, paint-stripper, alcoholic assault which does not bode well. Sinus clearing and NOT in a good, hop-ridden resionous way, more of a rubbing alcohol way. Nasty.
Given the nose, I was expecting a horrible alcoholic rip of the senses. Actually that did not materialize but a malt soaked, totally sugar drenched, completely unbalanced detergent like flavor DID. Uuuggghhh....even my well developed sweeter liking palate could not cope with this. Awful. As well as the crushing sweetness we get a weird, soap-like astringent bitterness which is probably the hop content trying desperately to get out of the bottle and escape death by sugar!
I found this close to impossible to drink and 3/4 of the bottle went down the drain. It's giving me a headache just thinking about it. Terrible in terms of the tastes, nose and drinkability (the most important factors). Wow, and not in a good way. Reminiscent of a badly brewed barleywine."

I've been holding on to it for a little while waiting for the moment that I felt like drinking a bomber full of a Quad - last night was that time.
Beer poured with a lovely, reddish hue with some real deep brown highlights. The head was decent on the aggressive pour and the foam left behind was creamy and made of fine bubbles giving a really smooth experience. Nose revealed virtually no alcohol but there were plenty of dark fruits. The raisin and rich, rum notes made up the majority of the initial tastes with a slight (very slight) acidity in the background. LOTS of rich, dark fruits all over the place.
The smells and tastes were similar to one another with heaps of brown sugar, sherry and Madeira notes. Sherry and mild alcohol manifest themselves nicely in the finish too.
This is a complex beer which is right up there amongst some of the better Belgians in the style. I'm NOT saying that this is a Westy 12 or a Rochefort 10, but it's in that territory and to be honest I doubt that it would look out of place amongst those beers in a tasting.
EXTREMELY drinkable consider the ABV and the style, and I got through this a little quicker than I wanted to. A super beer that exceeded my expectations by quite some distance. A very, very good brew."

The nose and tastes are obviously very malty (as per the style and in line with Einbecker beers in general) and there is plenty of sweetness too. Hop balance is at a minimum of course.
Definite organic, musty, earthy notes as well. This MAY be connected to the age of the beer, but without further information it is difficult to tell.
Delighted with the lower ABV and the drinkability despite the suspect age of the bottle.
All in all, definitely NOT as ""black"" as I was expecting, and definitely drank more like an English brown ale rather than anything else. Despite these attributes I still enjoyed it very much."

Summarized thus;
 + A blackish pour, but lacked any significant viscosity or motor oil color
 + Body felt fairly light and especially light for the style
 + Alcohol seemed well below the 8.2% advertised; unusual for a RIS
 + Nose and tastes had some of the roasty character that one would expect, but ultimately the characteristic, style bitterness was not there
All in all the beer was completely non-offensive but actually tasted like a slightly watered down version of the style.
I wouldn't say that I didn't enjoy it, I actually thought it was pretty drinkable, approachable, light and sensible in many ways, but American lovers of the RIS style would be very disappointed I suspect. Englishmen will probably tolerate this a little more, but even for me there is no doubt that this is a lightweight version of a style that really needs more presence."

Pour is quite an orangey golden one with a distinct lack of head, retention or lace. Makes the beer feel flat (although there is a little carbonation in the mouth) but overall lackluster.
Has a bit of an adjunct, macro feel about it and quite where any elements of Belgian candy or yeasts are I don't know. The beer is basically a run-of-the-mill, uninspiring paleish ale with little to distinguish it from the pack. Simple malts make up the majority of the tastes and hops are conspicuous by their absence. Very light in the flavor department - never a good thing!
Perhaps an older bottle, but without freshness dates I always feel justified in reviewing - how do the brewers expect us to know otherwise.

Well, I dunno; Kolsch? I suppose that we can argue over the extendability of the style guidelines but to me this takes things a bit too far.
The pour gives a color which I feel is too dark. It's really quite oraange. Secondly the malt dominance is just too great for me. The problem here is that when this happens the beer goes into ""less crisp mode"", and the refreshing, Saaz like bites that I am seeking in the style seem to go away.
The carbonation seemed about right for the stated style and as a result the mouthfeel was good, but overall I cam away with the impression of a beer well out of style.
Having said that I thought it was a decent drink even if it left me scratching my style head slightly.
I'm looking for a much cleaner, crisper angle on a beer that is categorized as a Kolsch and this didn't provide it. For that I'm going to mark the drinkability down, and I would also take style points away. That said, I could enjoy a few of these IF I could forget it was being present as a beer inspired for Cologne!"

The lack of Saaz crispness and the lack of cleanliness are big problems when it comes to a PIls beer, and to be honest this was seriously lacking n both departments.
The pour and appearance were promising enough with a decent, if not huge head sitting on top of a golden yellow body. Good carbonation.

Nose has some light orange and some mild hops.
The beer is very light and has a touch of light hops. It's so light it feels perhaps a touch watery. Finish has a little bitterness but to be honest it's very muted and unimpressive.

Nose and tastes are a largish, fragrant hop based assault with decent malts but ultimately even out to be just a bit ""blah"". Frankly we've seen it all before with these over-hopped, off balance DIPA's and this is just another that's gonna get lost in the mix for me. Lots of pine and really not much else, it's strange how beers like this seem to have captured the American palate. It must be the effect of prohibition and the bland macro water that dominates the scene.

First time that I've drunk a VE on the actual day!
Pour has a jet black body with a lovely, high head with fine bubbles. The bubbles are extremely fine in the way that creates that almost perfect, horizontal line between the body and the head that one finds in many nitro pour beers, or more commonly in Guinness. The head is not amazingly well retained, but it does leave some superb lace and a nice, spotty mocha film on the surface of the beer, with extra density in the middle of the beer. Looks very good.
Nose has some nice, chocolately notes with a very light touch of bitter hops.
The initial tastes go WAY beyond a Belgian Strong Dark and easily slips into a Belgian Stout (or even just into regular stout) areas. The beer really doesn't seem especially ""spicy"" to me at all, rather it really gets to be quite bitter both in the middle & the finish, and in the aftertaste. I might even go as far as to say that there is a touch of charcoal in there. I'd heard rumors of oranges, porters, spices and Belgian IPA's when others have been describing this beer and its tastes, but to be honest I get NONE of these. In fact, I don't really get any Belgian yeast notes either, and quite frankly although the beer is not bad, it seems a little disappointing to me. It's just not very complex beer at all; it's a nice stout with plenty of roasty bitterness, and it's a nice version of that kind of beer, but as far as all the other claims it seems to fall short.
As it warms and the bottle is consumed the beer becomes slightly less stout-like and the beer thins out in the mouth to feel slightly more BSDA like, but it STILL feels ""stoutish"" more than anything else.
I dunno, not especially complex and in that respect a little disappointing and definitely not Belgian in the way that it drinks.
It's a nice, roasty, light drinking stout to me and that's about it."

Pour is interesting simply because it produces exactly the kind of beer in the glass that I am looking for. It's a very noisy, rich pour with a creamy carbonation that leads to a reddish, mocha like foam on top of the body. The color of the body is a touch muddy, and lacks the absolute, crystal clear, garnet colored body that I would like, but it's not bad. Head is better looking than the body.
Outside of that the beer performs quite well within the style guidelines. Nice and malty with some quite serious hop overtones, the beer comes together well and provides a good balance of biter sweet notes. Trademark, traditional dryish ending adds to the experience.
Aftertaste is again a little ill-defined, but all in all a solid beer within the style."

Let's start with the price. This was $9.99 for the 12 oz bottle from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA. I spoke with Kraig at length about this and he assured me that this was correct. Seems bizarre.
The pour is a bit odd as well. Rather than getting a lovely, crystal clear, golden body we get a cloudy, butterscotch colored pour with a high bubbly head. To be honest, it looks more like a Hefe that anything else. Odd and not Pils like by any stretch of the imagination.
The nose gives away a little smoke(?) which is then massively exaggerated in the taste. I really don't understand it. By the end of this beer I feel as though I am almost drinking a smoked beer. Very odd. There are a few pepper highlights as well and a acrid, bitter, smoke filled finish. I'm confused.
The smokiness in the taste for this beer is a bit beyond my comprehension. I did not drink it in a smoky environment, nor did I drink it following a smoked beer, not did I drink it with smoked food. The whole thing is crazy. Either way I didn't like it much and the beer had a very poor drinkability for me. Coupled with the price, value = 0.

Pour is odd. Lots of large bubbles in the carbonation, but this leads to virtually no head, no retention and obviously no lace. It looks a bit dead in the glass. Disappointing from the carbonation angle. Color is a beautiful, deep orange color but even considering the ABV it seems lifeless.
The mouth feel confirms the lack of carbonation, and while I wouldn't call the beer ""flat"" I feel it need some more ""uuuummphh"".
Nose has some sweet Belgian notes with yeast. A lot of orangey alcohol too.
Tastes are that of some warming alcohol and some white pepper notes. Some yeast in the back end and a touch of Belgian candy. Some extra bubblegum comes through too. Triple like but seems to drink a little under the ABV. In that respect easy to put away.
The lack of sustained carbonation is a big problem here and it lets the beer down quite badly.

The nose on this beer is AMAZING. It takes me back to my childhood where the aroma of Hartley's raspberry jam come FLOODING back. Strong, sweet raspberries fill the nostrils, truly extraordinary.
There's very little subtlety in the taste and that's OK. This is a raspberry cocktail, even an alcopop and if you are looking for a lambic in the traditional, sour context forget it. Up front it as it leasts as sweet as a Lindeman's and although the back end of the beer does show a little more restraint, basically this is a sugar bomb and I rather like it! Slightly musty in the final analysis but that may be something to do with the age of the beer. No date on this bottle, but I know it's not young.

The tastes are strangely solvent like (despite the low ABV) and it lingers to give a touch of plastic amongst the pineapple.
I love pineapple but to be honest this is pretty nasty. It has a strong solvent like alcohol presence which is certainly odd and it taste of some kind of estery, chemical lab concoction. It is true that the age of the bottle is suspect, but without dates I feel justified in reviewing it.

What I like about Lagunitas is their simple adherence to style and the great value that one usual gets, especially in the bomber size.
Pour is a bright, golden, clear body with a high, bubbly head. The head leaves some superb, sticky lace which is exactly what I am looking for in a big 'ol American DIPA. For me the sticky nature of the lace is a VERY important feature of an American DIPA.
Nose gives plenty of sinus clearing, sweetened grapefuit, resinous hop notes. Tastes are very much in the same vein but the bitterness is absent in huge quantities, rather we get a sweet hoppy beer with just about as balanced a beer as one can hope for in this style (OF COURSE, it's NOT balanced at ALL, but that's the nature of the style!)
Surprisingly smooth, creamy mouthfeel and some nice, simple aftertastes that shy away from palate abuse!
In summary very drinkable and a beer that is just about as abalanced as one can expect given the style. As I say it isn't balanced per se, but it is a beer with significant malts to back up the hop profile. A subtle as the style will ever get!"

Nose and tastes are very much like cream soda. Not much fruit to speak of but plenty of sweet, wheat notes. I was half expecting red colortion to the beer and some strong fruit notes but neither were there. Cream sod flavoring is really quite strong and gets repeated.
Tasty and refreshing, and nice, ""no-too-fruity"" option for the summer but at the same time a beer that offers little else.

Having read a few reviews and considered the beer myself, I got a touch nervous about the combination of chocolate and oak. Frankly, these elements have the potential to be fighting one another in the tastes and this could be a difficult marriage.
Poured into the 22 oz, Terrapin snifter in several, small pours, the beer forms the expected look. Black body with a few dark brown highlights at the edges. Nice head initially, but this fades to a spotty, fine film on the surface of the beer with little or no lace.
Nose gives some alcohol, a touch of woody vanilla and a hint of chocolate.
The tastes do pretty much the same. The oaky, vanilla complements the minimal chocolate well, but then it kicks in some extra dry character and an ending which is also dry. This is a really close call, and although the oak doesn't really HELP the beer IMO, it also manages not to hinder it - I thought it may have done that. Aftertaste lingers and little and there is a mild, chest burn in the finish.
Alcohol is an element, but feels quite well hidden for me. Chocolate is muted but at the same time it's part of the beer. Frankly I would much prefer this without the woody oak AND with more chocolate, BUT even with this slight shortcoming it was not bad as I was concerned it might be.
Not perfect, and in my mind it could be better, however still a drinkable beer (better than expected) that I enjoyed sipping over the course of a couple of hours."

Nose gives little away apart from simple malts, a touch of grain and a non-descript fruit character that one would not necessarily grasp as being cherry based.
Tastes give a very muted cherry experience, and again not one that would stand out as being a potent cherry. It does have an authentic feel though, and the beer gives a dry, slightly tart fruit experience which is subtle, tasty and controlled.
A beer that is interesting and manages to be fruity by still very ""beer based"" with the fruit taking a backseat. Unlike some fruit beers this not especially ""fruity"" but it does bring the character of the cherry skins and dry, tart notes to the table."

Hazed, darkish orange pour with a small head that fades pretty quickly; minimal lace. Some chill haze.
Nose has a touch of alcohol, some peppery spice, a little estery fruit as well.
The tastes are an odd composite of lots of differnt strong flavors. Firstly we get some serious bubblegum and fruit. Mixed in there is some peppery, bitter alcohol and then some apparently bitterish hop bite in the finish! Really odd. This beer feels like a beer that is a cross between a Tripel, a Belgian IPA and a dryish hop based Pale Ale. It misses on most of these notes, and although the beer is drinkable I'm confused and a bit frustrated by it.
The finish is dry and there are more bubblegum tastes that are really quite strong.

This is absolutely an AMERICAN porter. It has far too harsh a hop profile for me and its roasty, bitter notes take me to a place that I do not want to go with a Porter. I'm looking for a much creameier, soft angle in my Porters and this fails to make the grade for me. Some chocolate notes in the finish but again more bitterness drives across the palate.

Back to the contents...
....decent gunsmoke on releasing the cap and good hiss. Beer is well carbonated that leads to a head that is small but well formed. Retention of the head is not great and very little lace.
Body is a very light copper color with some good clarity.
Nose has some quite strong, fruity esters and a decent amount of alcohol.
Quite sweet, but definitely with a good dose of Belgian yeast. To me this is not especially ""Blueberry"" in its make-up but it definitely has a strong , ester based, sweet, alcoholic edge. Light acidity too. Plenty of trademark Belgian candy notes that perhaps have a source in the natural sugars in the fruit??
Very tasty (in a non-blueberry way), very smooth and a lovely alcoholic warmth in the end and aftertaste.
VERY drinkable and a beer that is reminiscent of a Tripel with a touch of pepper in there too. A little solvent like alcohol but in a good way. I really thought that this was delicious and seemed to drink with a punch. Goes down real easy and lacks any cloying nature that I was a bit concerned about.
Better beer than the nonsense on the bottle and the name would suggest."

Pour gives a mid-orange body with some white head and a little lace. 
Nose reveals a fairly potent, acidic and lemon based smell. The aroma seems ""tart"" (if that's possible)!
The tastes are all acid with slightly, under-ripe, green apples coming to mind. ANOTHER funky, Fantome Saison that is basically almost exactly like a dry, Devonshire/Somerset scrumpy. The similarity is unmistakable and unavoidable.
Light carbonation that invigorates the tongue, and together with the acidity the beer really livens up the palate. As the bottle is consumed, the beer becomes less tart and the funk evens out a little. The finish is sharp and abrupt and does not linger. Some hay, classic barnyard funk & manure and grassy acidity. No alcohol present in the taste.
If you are not into the acidity of a typical, traditional English cider then you need to leave this beer alone. IF on the other hand you are a fan of rustic, organic-like beverages that have an edgy, unrefined touch then this is going to work well for you; either way it's tasty."

I've had this a couple of times before, now time for a formal review.
Pour gives a rich, dark brown body with a mocha, coffee colored head that is fairly dense at first look. The head disappears fairly quickly (unsurprisingly considering the ABV) but does leave a nice collar and some spotty, creamy film on the surface of the body.
The aroma and the taste do have some of the sherry, Madeira and fig/raisin notes that one is looking for in a Quad, BUT the spice is quite strong and it starts to subtract from the richness of the beer/style. There's more acidity than I want in the style, and it takes the beer down a touch in my estimation. Some licorice bitterness that I don't need and more acidity in the aftertaste. Mmmm...lacks the smoothness I want in a Quad. Sorry.
Some creaminess in the body, but again the spice seems to add to the thinner nature of the beer and it is quite harsh. Alcohol is present but at the same time as well hidden as one can expect for 10.00% and for the style. Burns a little but that's not a huge problem for me.
For me this beer lacks the depth and quality of many Quads. I want a REALLY strong sherry note, some intense cream and a lack of edgy acidity. I don't dislike the beer but there are very many Quads that I would choose over it if I was looking to stay within the style. This is acidic, especially for the style and the introduction of some spicy pepper notes takes me away from where I need to be in the style."

Pretty good value I thought, but I decided to pass the first couple of time that I see it. Anyway, fast forward a couple of days and Taco Mac on the East West Connector, Austell, GA, USA has it on tap. I order one and ultimately find out it is $9.50 for the small pour! TERRIBLE value. Anyway, back to the beer....
...pour is slightly clouded and is on the orange side of things rather than the paler yellow or golden. Thinnish head but it does linger and leave some wispy lace.
Some funk, a little sweetnesa and a slightly grapefruit based finis make up the beer, and it comes together quite well and nicely for the style. However, it's definitely nothing special and the price for the draft version of this was absolutely, daylight robbery. The bottle at $7.99 would be pretty good value.
In short, drink this at home (or at least not somewhere that's charging $9.50 for a small pour) and you'll get a decent example of style that is refreshing and tasty. If you pay $9.50 for approx. 12 oz then you'll most likely feel ripped-off."

Light brown, cold coffee color with small head and ring of collar left on and around the surface of the beer.
Vapors that gather in the nose are quite surprisingly alcoholic with a touch of malt.
Tastes are quite sweet with some lovely, light coffee notes and general understatement all around. Light warmth is left on the tongue as the alcohol spreads and leaves its mark. Some touches of light, roasted beans in the finish too. Sugary aftertaste.
VERY thin in the mouth, especially considering the style. Definitely the weakest point for the beer.
Actually avery tasty beer that is quite drinkable and the light coffee notes are enjoyable. Mouthfeel is rather light so if you are looking for a ""big"" coffee beer this will not cut it, however I still enjoyed it."

I usually approach Rogue with some trepidation since I often find their beers over-hopped but this blew me away. (I was worried with the bottle design having hops strewn about Mr. Maier!!)
A significant hiss on opening and a lively pour with a good dose of carbonation. BEAUTIFUL clarity on the golden orange pour with great streaming carbonation - fantastic to look at. Nice white head and some very nice lace.
Plenty of bready malts on the nose with a little organic hay-like alcohol and hoppiness.
Mouthfeel is beautiful too with a touch of prickly carbontion that settles on the tongue to liven the senses. Fine-bubbled, fizzing carbonation gives a great sense of well-being!
Delicious cascading malts and light bitterness come together with a sweet, semi-dry finish that gives great satisfaction and mellow, butterscotch note in the aftertaste. Slightly drier and VERY slightly more hoppy than your average O'fest/Marzen which normally would not sit well with me, but this was fantastic. Mellow aftertaste and moreish character.
DEFINITELY my new favorite Rogue and a really interesting beer. EXTREMELY tasty! Best beer that I have had the pleasure to drink in some time. Delicious."

Pour is a suprisingly bright, garnet red color which encourages me. Head is short lived and even knowing about the bottle conditioning, the beer seems rather fizzy by many standards. This detracted from the mouthfeel for me. It was a bit prickly for me.
Plenty of classic maltiness but coupled with vanilla and oak notes. The oak is rather pleasingly sweet as opposed to dry, and in that respect the beer avoids some of the usual pitfalls associated with similar beer. Nice sweetness sits against a mellowed bitterness to form a very rounded picture. I agree with others in terms of a fig presence (slightly surprising) but of course the caramel, biscuit sweetness is just what I would expect for a beer with this malt base - no surprise there.
I enjoyed this a bit more than I thought I would, but at the price point I cannot see myself buying this very often, if ever, again. Good beer but not good value."

The beer starts off with a great looking black pour that appears totally opaque with little or no colored highlights when held up to the light. Head is small but the film across the top of beer is surprisingly complete. Looks good. Would have been better if I just looked at it rather than tasted it!
The beer exudes a smell that is similar to a double IPA, with a strong hoppy note but with some astringent citrus and roasty licorice aromas. Not my cup of tea but not bad.
The tastes have some citrus (lemon) like notes and some VERY aggressive hops that are unrestrained. There is also a nasty, burned plastic character that to be honest is the adibing memory of this beer. VERY aggressive and dry in the finish. I'm not sure where the pilsner angle comes in, nor am I sure of the point of a ""black"" pilsner, in fact the whole thing is completely lost on me. What starts off as a touch of grapefruit in the taste very quickly becomes a combination of cough syrup, old lemon rind and light pepper. Plastic, plastic, plastic! Hot, messy, over the top alcohol as well.
To me, a beer that is perhaps simply trying to be big for the sake of it, and is just ""showing-off"". This matches what I expect from Brewdog and their take on things, but I was hoping that Stone would resist the temptation to get caught up in this nonsense.
Aftertaste is very dry, astringent and frankly unpleasant. Nasty drainpour, put simply a misguided collaboration/emperor's new clothes type beer, that someone managed to convince themselves was great, and then inlficted upon the general public."

Some simple banana notes with decent alcohol warmth and some spice notes. The beer is not over-stated despite the alcoholic content and it drinks and sits less agressively than one originally may have thought.

Slightly chill-hazed pour with a traditional, light, bubbly head that although not dense, still provides some very nice, sticky lace. Has a cask appearance in terms of the head. Served WAY too cold for my liking, even without the traditional, American frozen glassware! Let it warm a little.
Body is a brownish hue which is not epecially attractive but I guess I'm being a bit hard here. Lacks the classic, deep garnet color that I would really love for the style, but I can live with that.
Nose gives of some of the classic, soft biscuit malt notes and some light caramel. The same things occur in the taste which are in line with the style. So far, so good but the finish is just a little too dry and hoppy for me IF we are talking about an ESB in the classic, English sense. Don't get me wrong, this is NOT a ""hoppy"" beer as such but it does have the American hop influence in the finish which is sort of par for the course in the USA. Despite this it still drinks nicely and with the ""lowish"" ABV I am delighted that the beer is around for me to drink on a regular basis.
Nice job (as usual) by 5SW, but Crawford just needs to let me come and tweak the hops down a notch and the malt up a notch! ;-))"

I think that the basic idea of ""imperializing"" an Oktoberfest beer is essentially a bad idea since it's simply not a style that needs that kind of treatment, but let's take a closer look.
Pour lacks much life, but that may be a function of the ABV. Golden orange body with a lack of much sustainable head, minimum carbonation and no lace at all. Nice color but overall a touch ordinary to look at.
The nose is not really definitive and offers not much more than alcoholic malt.
The tastes are mainly a metallic, copper coinage bitterness and some alcoholic malts. The sweetness also starts to come through with a lot of sugary elements which then cascade into the finish. More alcohol. This seems ill-defined. Cloying as the bottle is consumed. Lots of sulfur notes.
Essentially a bad idea to start with and it drank in that manner as well. I suggest a crisp, lower ABV, more traditional version of the style and the drinkability will likely be infinitely better and give you a more quintessential version of the style."

Pour is a turbid brown with very good head, lace and retention. The head was really thick and pleasing almost like the ""scum"" that one gets on top of a fermentation tank. The color is less appealing, but that's just a function of the beer and my persoanl dislike of that muddy brown, Dubbel-like appearance.
Nose and tastes are very bready at first with a yeasty, spice, citrusy note that sits very oddly when you are looking at the beer. It's a case where the tastes tend not to match the appearance - mind games ensue (see Freaktoberfest for somethign similar). Lots more bready notes in the finish and a really chewy beer for me.
It's a fine line when trying to pull off a beer that is a bit odd like this one, and Crawford managed it in as much as I enjoyed it. However, I don't think I'm going to visit this much in the future because it's just a little too ""out ther"" for me."

750 mL capped bottle, yellow dot-matrix indicates a 04/14/06 bottling. 3.5 years old, DFH, THIS should be interesting!
Uncapping leads to a hint of gunsmoke and a brief ""pssst"".
Amber, hazed body with a nicely formed tight, white head and some cream like lace. Very solid looking in the glass.
Nose gives off some honey, pineapple and lighter tropical fruits along with a dash of Madeira and some rum-like aromas. There is also a touch of that musty, cellar-like ""old"" smell which often comes with beers of this age. A definite ""earthy"" funky note too, but again this is age related. Alcohol is still present in all its original glory.
Many of the aromas are replicated in the taste, but the strong malt layers of bock presence make themselves very apparent as does a touch of warming alcohol in the finish. More light rum and sherry touches are intermingled with the musty notes.
Surprisingly smooth, and goodness knows why but it reminds me a bit of a nitro-pour! Very smooth, almost like a Boddington's or John Smith's cream flow! GULP!
Anyway, in summary this beer has managed to maintain a fairly large degree of integrity over the three and half years since bottling both in the taste & appearance department and in terms of the style. Of course, without tasting it fresh (which I would have loved to have done) there's no way of knowing how the beer has matured and changed, but it still stands up pretty well which is a testament to the skill of the DFH name."

Excellent color on the pour, perhaps a little darker than some in the style, the depth of the mahoghany is quite striking. Head is somewhat disappointing though, fades quickly and not much lace.
Nose reveals some typical malt character with sweetness, but there is a hint of hops too.
Similar situation in the taste with the majority of the body made up from the typical, sweetish, caramel, sugary notes but again there is a bit of a hop bite hanging around and in the finish.
Frankly I could do without the large hop presence in the beer since I feel it is a slight bastardization of the style. The bitterness gathers pace as the bottle is consumed and ends up being a bit of an annoyance.
I've been pretty unimpressed with Pennichuck so far and this really doesn't do much to change that situation for me. One and done here, especially with so many other, better exmples of the style out there at this time of year."

Pour is a standard color of deep amber, but lacks much head or retention. In that respect a touch disappointing.
Nose is also quite mute, with some malts coming through but overall the beer seems rather low-key.
A mouthfeel which is below average for me. It feels on the thin side and definitely lacks much presence or lively carbonation. Feels a bit flat.
Tastes have the standard malt backbone and some degree of light nuttiness but again it seems to lack punch.
For me this is an interesting beer because in the American versions of these beers we usually get much more hop presence. I am basically against that idea in a Brown Ale, in as much as I want them to be at the sweeter end of the spectrum with reserved hops and bigger malts. The problem here is that although the hops are muted (good), the malt and the mouthfeel fail to deliver the necessary body for me. It falls between two stools, and I would think that this would be a bit disappointing to both lovers of the American version of the style, and those that prefer the more traditional Brown Ale.
In the end, disappointing."

A lovely, golden body with perfect clarity and some excellent wispy, fine lace. Bone-white colored head. Carbonation is medium. Good color, and the fact that the name includes the word ""Golden"" seems appropriate.
Nose and tastes reveal a very subtle, but potent hop profile. This is VERY reminiscent of a wet-hopped beer. I don't know if it is ACTUALLY wet-hopped but it certainly smells and drinks that way. Decent malt backbone holds it all together and although the hop profile is strong, it is also light and delicate at the same time.
Not my favorite type of beer, but New Belgium seems to have crafted a nice beer here. Should appeal to the hop loving crowd, but the delicate nature also finds a place on my palate too. Nice beer to dovetail with the upcoming, cooler season. Crisp and dry in the finish it works well. Tailgating anyone?
Impressive and simple, this beer is one that I was surprised by and enjoyed very much. I'm a touch confused by the American Blonde categorization but that's trivial, it's still a good beer."

Nose reveals something fruity, although frankly it is difficult for me to distinguish much in terms of watermelon.
The tastes add more fruit, and although it is stronger than the nose it still seems more like pineapple or pear to me than watermelon. Definite ""estery"" angle no matter which way you look at it. Smooth in the mouth. the beer is quite sweet, and I would imagine that many will find it too much so. I on the other hand, enjoyed it very much since I have a sweet tooth.
I was interested to try this beer since, as we know, real watermelon does not have a very strong ""taste"" at all, however the traditional, Jolly Rancher, artificial watermelon taste that has become the popular and accepted taste was missing here - I'm glad it was. This beer was a long way from that artificial concoction.
It does a decent job as a wheat based refresher in summer months, but for me that's about its limit. Use it as a Hefe replacement and you'll probably be quite happy."

Nose is a combo of some resinous hops with some sinus clearing, sweet alcohol.
Like the regular 90 min, this is a pretty sweet beer. To be honest it treads a very fine line between that cloying sweetness, hot alcohol and palate stripping hop presence. From one mouthful to the next, the beer works and then doesn't work in almost equal measure. When one makes a beer like this that is an occupational hazard and although understandable and an almost inevitable consequence of a beer of this nature, it does not help the long term drinkability. I enjoyed this - JUST! You HAVE to be in the mood for it. I get the feeling that if I were to visit this on 10 different occasions, half of the time I would not care for it much.

Tastes are quintessential for the style. VERY, very light smoke, plenty of malts and a sweet undertone. The beer is very dry especially in the finish. Surprisingly so. It actually leaves a small coating on the teeth.

Pour is a lovely, black body with some brownish highlights. The head is rocky, mocha in color and high. It looks great, but to be honest it fades a bit quickly and loses depth leaving not much lace.
This is a really interesting beer to me for a number of reasons. Firstly I really enjoy SKA. Secondly the head fading so quickly is a bit of a disappointment.
Normally, beers of this style, with this ABV tend to be pretty boozy and substantial in the mouth (take Smuttynose Baltic Porter as an example), so I am really quite surprised that this beers lacks a really big alcohol presence and the beer is really relatively thin. It's true that the alcohol seems to build toward the end of the bottle, but at the same time t seems really manageable and fairly simple.
Not especially complex, but that's both good and bad. It adds to the drinkability somewhat, but it is a little unusual for the style. In that respect a very light drinking beer if you consider the style.

Added as a new entry to the BA db but surprised that it is not in already. I know there can be confusion with locations, brewpubs etc., but this is labeled as being brewed by Fordham in Dover, DE so I have added it there.



Pour is a cloudy yellow as one would expect, but the necessary, high, rocky, well retained head that should produce great lace is missing - a shame.



Nose revelas the standard clove, spice and a touch of artificial, mashed banana.



The tastes skirt around the place they need to be without ever really diving fully in to the mix. A little insipid which is not helped by the thin mouthfeel and the somewhat dulled tones.



Seems like a slightly below average Hefe to me, and perhaps a beer that was brewed to appeal to the masses rather than hit the style on the head. I dunno, rather disappointing to say the least."

Tastes are importantly crisp, dry and refreshing. As it should be, i.e. simple and straightforward.
No off-flavors and although the beer lacks a huge Saaz like bite in the finish that I often look for in my Pils, it still satisfies, goes down easy and s very drinkable.

Lots of banana notes more than anything else. In fact, this almost seems like a banana, alcoholic cocktail! It certainly skates around the Tripel style, but to me it really feels quite thin. Alcohol is resent, but that's OK becuase the style demands it, and to be honest given the 9.00% it seems quite manageable. There are some serious yeast notes in there as it should be, but this beer is really weak for me.

Nose and tastes immediately raise the caramel stakes. Lots of light, sugary notes but these give way to the ethanol fairly quickly.

Many Italian beers have been a crap shot for me, and the combination of varying quality and somewhat expensive prices have led me to be a touch wary. From time to time I'll break down and get one, and this is one of those times.
Pour is initially extremely carbonated but this fades fast. A thin ring around the beer and some surface froth leaves very little lace. The body is a simple golden color with some cloudiness and quite a lot of gray sediment.
Nose and tastes are very herbal (as expected). Many of these Italian beers have a distinct herbal nature, and I am wondering if this is a feature of the yeast strains. The herbs are quite nice and they build across the whole bottle to give an almost, mild burning chili feel toward the end of the beer. There is some light paper in there as well.
Not a traditional farmhouse or saison by any stretch of the imagination, but a beer that is intriguing. Not especially complex either, but tasty nonetheless. The one place this brew falls down a little is the mouthfeel. It really feels a touch thin to me, and that's one of the abiding memories (unfortunately). Lowish ABV (relatively speaking) is a plus for me.

Standard look, with good lace and retention.
The strongest part of the beer was the nose which was POTENT! One of the stronest clove notes I have witnessed in some time. Rounded out with a touch more spice and some light banana.
Very true to style, I could see how many German's would be impressed by this beer. Arguably the best of the bunch on my visit and a beer that Mike is truly (and rightly) proud of.

Style 103/103 reviewed on BA.
Pour yields a highly carbonated body and some decent head. Unfortunately the head is gone within 90 seconds as the large bubbles disappear and there is virtually no lace. Carbonation seems very high. Body is a typical macro, yellow piss color, no better or worse than scores of other macro's.
Nose is a little strong. VERY strong vegetal notes, smells like dirty water.
The taste is an artifically, plastic-like affair with a surprising lack of bitterness. Many non-alcoholic beers I have had in the past have had a strong bitterness - this doesn't. If it were not for the smell that one gets when the glass goes up to the mouth, one would think that this were simply carbonated water. The mouthfeel is woefully thin and the taste is that of water that has been siting in a plastic bottle, in a warm car for a couple of days. Aftertaste is slightly malty.
Let's face it, you can't make worthy beer with little or zero alcohol."

Pour is a slightly ruddy, black pour with some brownish red highlights at the extremities. The head is frothy and dense but is surprisingly short lived. Some light lace, but not as good as I was hoping.
Nose gives plenty of sweet chocolate malts. Quite chocolate-like and in that respect rather unusual.
Slight acidity in the taste. Perhaps not as creamy as I was expecting, but also perhaps not quite as hoppy as I was expecting for and American version of this old, English style. Interesting and a little surprising.
Finish comes with a slight smoke element and an additional metallic charcoal note - it's subtle, but it's there.
Drinkability is good, and to be honest not as aggressive as many American Porters and in that respect I prefer it. I generally prefer a creamy, less aggressive, malty rather than hoppy Porter and this fits the bill."

I've been drinking Ruddles County (and Ruddles Best with the blue logo) for about 25 years, but not so much in the last ten since I've been marooned in the USA. My past experience has largely been on draft and in cans, but this is one of the clear glass, imported bottles.
Pour is resplendent. It gives a beautiful, light copper body and a fantastic, frothy, large bubbled, sustained head and great sticky lace.
HUGE, light biscuity malts and delicate hops fill the nostrils even before the pour. Cracking the cap gives a whiff and then the pour releases the full force.
Tastes are a gentle assault. Wave after wave of light biscuit malts, simple hop bitterness and smooth sweet ending. The aftertaste lingers forever! 
There's a whole bunch of things that I want to say about this beer. It reminds me of some of my earliest drinking days as a teenager between the ages of about 15 and 19 (and beyond). At the time, the beer seemed impossibly hoppy, and to be honest, in the context of English Beers of this ilk it really is quite dry and bitter, but of course in the light of contemporary American brewing it seems somewhat tame. Of course, that tame nature is really classy and subtle in a manner that the higher hopped and higher ABV American beers could NEVER begin to understand, but that's a different story.
There's also a degree of nostalgia attached to this beer (in fact a HUGE amount), but even considering that I am conscious of this, it's still a STUNNING beer to me. it reminds me of my Dad. 
Finally many will argue that Greene King has corrupted this beer over time, and to be honest I think that there is some truth to that, but even 25 years after I first drank it the beer brings a tear to my eye for more than one reason.
God Bless this beer."

First off I made an assumption about this beer that is often correct but in this case was a little off. The production of a beer like this in a brewpub is usually done mainly to satisfy the hoards of BMC drinkers that can only stomach a light beer of some description. When I asked Mike about this he told me that yes, there was *some* truth in that, BUT he would only be content brewing a beer that additionally stood on its own, and secondly would also appeal (in style) to BA's like me. Well, he did it! In retrospect, of the five beers that i tasted on my visit, this wasarguably my favorite - never something that I would have predicted in advance of my visit.



Pour gave a light colored body but the hue was darker than a typical light beer. Slightly more viscous in the mouth, the Cream Ale elements came through very strongly in the nose and across the palate.



Easy drinking with a richness that ne does not normally associate with the style or such a relatively delicate beer. Finish was rounded nicely and gave way to a touch of sweetness.



A super beer, and a delight to behold. It's great to hear the philosophy behind the beer too, and Mike has done a really nice job with this one. Tasty."

Looks good and as it should. High, rocky, white head and a light, lemon colored body with the appropriate clouded appearance. Unusually though, very little yeasty sediment came out in the last 20% swirl.
Nose lays on the banana side of things rather than the clove. Spices are low-key for the style.
Light banana is replicated in the tastes with a touch more spice being evident compared to what was suggested by the nose. Simple, but true to style.
Mouthefeel is where this beer seems to fade some. It feels a little too watery for me and frankly I end end being a bit disappointed. Lacks depth. Lowish ABV helps me to like this more.
Nice looker, nice nose and some tastes that work, but this beer ultimately fails to deliver in terms of mouthfeel and satisfaction."

Nose gives off an artificial sweetness, detectable as ""fruity"" but not especially banana based. The taste reflects this mystery fruit, although it is more banana-like than the nose. Musty, cardboard enters the equation as well.
Cloyingly sweet and not much else. Odd that since the beer is so nastily sweet, it still manages to feel thin?! It's also cloying, which seems to be an oxymoron when coupled with thin. I dunno, either way it's horribly disappointing and difficult to drink.

A nice combo on the nose of some fruit and well balanced sweet malts and hops.
Malty and biscuity, the hops are subtle in this beer and for intents and purposes this is an English IPA. It lacks the harsh, upfront aggression that the American version of the style often has, and in that respect some will probably be disappointed. A fruity note balances some hop bitterness very well. Take it down a couple of ABV points and we have really nice English version. Aftertaste is moreish and has some more sweetness.

Pour is a bright, golden-orange body that sits underneath a rocky head with great retention.
Nose gives quite a lot of syrupy, sugar alcohol and a touch of the hops.
Tastes are quite a subtle combination of Saaz like bitterness and alcohol which has a slight warming effect. The aftertaste emphasizes both quite well. 
Smooth in the mouth with no hint of the cloying nature that I was anticipating given the style and the alcohol. Ice cold this beer is feverishly easy to drink but as it warms it comes into an area that I think it is supposed to sit in. It does have a high alcohol presence and quite a noticeable degree of hop bitterness, especially in the finish. For those reasons I would say that at least in terms of the way it drinks (and ignoring formal style descriptions), this beer is basically an Imperial Pils. In fact, I was trying to place where I thought I had tasted this combo before and it was easy to remember - Rogue Imperial Pils and Sam Adams Imperial Pils.
In summary, it's an Imperial Pilsner and in that respect I am very curious as to how this compares to Krampus."

Pour is a hazy, orange/yellow that seems closer to a Wit rather than a Saison.
Nose has light clove and bananas, again, replicating a Wit rather than the Saison style.
Tastes are a sweet and sour combo with some lemon notes and some ""bitterish"" orange peel. As others have noted, there is a bitterness about the beer that one might associate with the rye. It has a dry, slightly hoppy note that I would not normal associate with the style, and it's almost as if the beer has half a toe in the Belgian IPA style. There's a very light touch of funkiness there too but it's very light for the style, and even a mild alcohol burn in the chest afterwards.
I'd call this pretty complex, and I would not call it necessarily a typical Saison, in fact for me it's closer to a cross between a Wit and a Belgian IPA. Very interesting. Complicated beer that walks a fine line between bad and good. Tricky beer this one, and by far the most interesting and complicated in the SP series so far.
Not my favorite beer, but definitely a brew that is worth taking a long hard look at. Even though I'm not in love with it, I would certainly recommend trying it."

At the time I knew that they had been around for quite a while, so I expect that these a quite old, BUT with no freshness dating of any description on the beer it simply isn't possible to know. If brewers don't put dates then I think it's entirely legitimate to review their beers.
12 oz mini-champagne, capped and corked. The cork is tight but it does not leave the bottle with much pop.
Body has a really obvious, plum colored, purple hue. Really attractive color, but the head is largely non-existent. A few bubbles but it's not really dense and it seems forced as if a person has blown bubbles into the beer with a straw.
Nose has a pungent cherry, candy notes. The beer is pretty sweet but it's not too much for me. Others may take another position. In the back end there is a touch of musty, old character. Is this an old bottle? We'll never know. Light acidity in the back too, but obviously no funk.
OK, it is what it is. This is a sweetened lambic NOT a sour/funk, but I like it. I would like to have this very fresh as I suspect I would score it even higher.

Pour is a rich garnet body which looks good, but the head and lace are just woefully disappointing considering the style. I want a rich, dense head and (at least in part) because of the ABV and the way the alcohol is constructed in this beer I am disappointed. Lower the ABV and get a better beer is what I say.
Anyway, nose has alcohol and quite a bit of sherry amongst the malt base. As expected and nice.
Tastes reflect the nose and lay o the sweet side of things which sits well with me. A touch of alcohol burn in the finish that I can do without. Mouthfeel lacks density and is a little light for the style and for what I am looking for. The alcohol presence seems to cause the mouthfeel to thin out even more. Lots of sugars present
I dunno, for one of my favorite styles, and a brewer that I like, the alcohol here seems to intrude upon the brew in a way that's not good. There's a certain lack of balance that seems to manifest itself in more than one area and spoils the beer a little for me."

Pour is a deep red with slightly off-white head that leaves some nice, sticky lace. The lace is an important feature of this style for me. Good clarity on the pour.
Nose and tastes show plenty of malty sweetness, but being faithful to the American version of this style there is also plenty of hop character to balance it out. It finishes dry (which is what I want the style to do), and it leaves me with some nice, hoppy burps. Caramel and toffee notes against the malt background, some (light if that's possible) molasses as well.
To be honest this drinks much bigger than either the style or the ABV would suggest, and in some ways it reminds me a little of a much bigger (in all respects), American Strong Ale.
Drinkable and punches a touch above its weight. Solid beer from a solid brewer."

Didn't think I would ever see this again, but thanks to a recent trader, I got this bottle. Best Before October 2006 - err....almost three years late; never mind.
Pour is a bright, tangerine body with a healthy head and some sediment. Head fades to a thin film on the surface of the beer. It looks as though it has held up quite well over the years. 
Nose and tastes have some yeasty, Saison like breadiness. The tastes reflect that and then in the end you get the hint of ginger. It lingers a bit in the aftertaste and it's a nice change. Tasty brew even after all of this time. Some honey smooths out the finish as well.

Fantome is usually pretty interesting and I don't suppose that Chocolat is likely to be any less! 
Bizarre color on the pour, it looks like liquid Butterscotch, with a murky thin body (that's why I gave it a ""5"", not because it was particularly ""good"", but because it was ""exceptional""). The initially vigorous head does fade but leaves a thin film of foam on the surface of the beer and some collar and a little lace.
Nose gives away the usual farmhouse, Fantome funk with perhaps an extra note of acidity (or is that simply a powdery, bakers chocolate that I get?)
Quite gassy without being highly carbonated, there is some prickle in the body.
With eyes open, the chocolate element is obvious (color), but with eyes closed it seems rather like just another Fantome with one tiny exception; a little, tiny heat in the finish and aftertaste from the chilli. Drinakbility increases down the bottle for me with greater and greater organic elements seemingly coming through. Still not much chocolate though, and that's just fine - I wasn't expecting a ""chocolate"" beer from the Soy crowd!
Interesting and as drinkable as many Fantome's, but ultimately a bit of a novelty for me."

Pour is a darkish amber (copper) which slightly contradicts the ""Pale Ale"" moniker on the label. Head forms quickly, but disappers quickly too. Minimal lace.
Nose and tastes are surprisingly sweet, and with the color of the beer I begin to wonder what kind of grain bill we have in this beer. Bready sugar too. This doesn't do well as an Irish Red, and it's not really got much Pale Ale character at all. My bet is that the words ""Pale Ale"" have been slapped on the package purely for marketing purposes. Falls between a number of stlyes and misses several of them by a wide margin.
Very middle of the road for me. Not bad, not good but my suspicion is that more effort went into the marketing of this beer than the making of it. Shame, but it's likely to be one and done for me. Non-offensive is the best I can come up with."

Much like its brother, this beer owes more to the marketers than it does the brewers. I liked this about the same as the ""Pale"" Ale, but again it seemed very mediocre and a beer that is searching for a style home.
Pour gives a balck body with some dull, red highlights. Head is short-live, lace is minimal.
Nose gives away some sweet malts and a touch of roastiness but to be honest it's pretty light. Bidy seems a touch on the light side too. A touch of bitterness in the finish but it all seems a little half-arsed to me. Hastily put together by the MBA's raher than the brewmaster.

Nose delivers unmistakable sweet malts and a hint of alcohol.
Tastes are pretty much in line with the style although it is not quite as sweet as I was anticipating and the alcohol is certainly well hidden. A dryish finish (for the style) and a hint of smoke perhaps? Obviously very malt based as it should be. The finish also imparts a touch of licorice amongst the dry character.

Nose has dry, baking chocolate (or cocoa/Cadbury's drinking chocolate) with some light fruit infused. The fruit seems like a cross between cherry and raspberry, but to be honest it is more on the raspberry side of things to my nose.
Tastes are light but at the same time have some decent presence. There are plenty of slightly bitter chocolate notes with a gentle fruity acidity alongside it. The aftertaste and finish linger very gently with touch more bitterness and some subtle, light cherry juice.
The body is light as well which helps add to the drinkability and puts it into the ""high"" category. ABV nowhere to be seen.

The nose is essentially neutral which is not necessarily a bad thing, but at the same time is probably the weakest part of the brew.

The appearance is unusual for a Quad. It is very orange. Clouded body and a decent amount of head, lace and retention considering the ABV. A little light for a Quad.
Nose and tastes are extremly fruity. Alcohol is conspicuous by it's relative absence in both the nose and tastes considering the whopping 11.3. The fruit is not easy to place, but it's definitely a bubble-gum based thing. The alcohol comes through a touch in the finish, but to be honest it's not at all overpowering. Sweetness begins to grind a touch after half of the first glass. 
Very powerful beer in terms of the ABV and of course this is really a double-edged sword.
Not really my cup of tea and at 11.3 it simply becomes a beer that requires just too much planning and effort for me, without the pay-off of being a great brew."

Winter Warmer??? I thought it was more like an American IPA.

Tastes are bitter rather than spiced. Very American IPA like in terms of aggressive hops. This is tempered by some malt but the whole combo is not very good. It has a dry finish. Lacks a typical combo of spices and sweetness and the beer is a bit of a peppery, bitter mess.

Some of these Scratch brews seem to be stylistically challenged which may be a function of the BA database or perhaps a function of the beer. Either way it could lead to some confusion and disappointment.
This appears to be a coffee infused stout as opposed to an oatmeal version.
Pour is the requisite black with brown highlights. Fair enough. Head is average, but lace is disappointing.
Nose is roasted malt and some alcohol.
Tastes are HUGELY coffee based and the oatmeal stout distinction is nowhere to be seen. The oatmeal would normally expected to lend a hand in the creation of some creamy notes in the mouthfeel but they are distinct in their absence. If you are looking for an oatmeal stout you are going to be disappointed.
Thin in the mouth with that acidic, bitter, astrigent coffee aftertaste that one gets with poor quality coffee grinds.
Overall very poor with a drying finish and a pretty poor drinkability.

I think it's worth saying right off the top that this beer is fairly atypical of Fantome. It lacks some of the excessive funk that one often finds and whilst certainely ""spiced"", it's in a herbal manner which is somewhat out of the ordinary for them.
Pour is a turbid, murky brown Dubbel like body (not very attractive) with a better than expected head. Nice foam and surface film that persists.
A touch of alcohol and some herbal spice in the nose. Some fruit that rounds out the nose.
Tastes are more herbal notes. Somewhat reminiscent of a Cinzano Bianco (see my review of Lost Abbey 10 Commandments for the full story on that), but less fruity and MUCH more aggressive in the bitterness department. In fact, a little Angostura in there and a quite brutal finish. The harsh bitterness is surprising at the back end, but to be honest it's both manageable and fitting with the herbal nature of the beer.
As I say, lacks some of the usual Fantome character, but for me it's better for it. Certainly one of my favorite from Soy, and perhaps even my current, personal #1. Great stuff."

Light orange pour with a soapy, thinnish head that fades quickly. Despite this the head imparts some decent, sticky lace - better than I was expecting.
Nose is a fairly strong, summer fruit aroma. It has elements of apricot but also some serious peach tones as well. A bit strong and sickly.
The nose runs right into the taste and we find similar attributes there. It tastes a little like one of those highly flavored, fruit chewing gums! Artificial and quite strong. Not much else going on here.
A summer refresher for sure, but after 12 oz I'm done. The tastes (fruit) start to grind a little and it gets a touch tiring for the palate.

OK, essentially this is a Quad. Right from the appearance, the ABV, through to the nose, the taste and the way it drinks.
Much darker that a standard tripel, the beer pours out a really dark orange. There is a very large amount of yeasty sediment in the viscous body. Head is small, but very sticky - both functions of the ABV.
Nose releases a slight sherry note which is reproduced to a greater extent in the taste. The body looks quite viscous. That's not a surprise given the ABV, but at the same time it seems too much for the style. LOTS of sherry and alcohol in the taste. Light burn in the finish. Nose is great, but the tastes seems a little weak. It's not a very good Tripel in my book, but at the same time it's a pretty nice beer.
Lacks white pepper and spice notes almost completely and in that respect is not in style at all. ABV is a touch high for a Tripel too and the appearance is darker than one would expect. In a blind taste I would obviously see this a Belgian, but no way would peg it as a Tripel. You can make up your own mind if you think that is a good or bad thing, but either way I quite enjoyed the beer."

Nose and tastes have a mild sweetness. A balanced beer by any standards but if you put it in the context of Rogue's, often over-hopped brews this is especially surprising. Reminds me a lot of an English Pale with the biscuity sweetness and the sensible ABV.
Very drinkable.
The beer also has a very creamy mouthfeel. Perhaps this comes from the Soba(?), but it adds to the drinkability.

Poured into the Brasseries l'Abbaye des Rocs chalice the beer sits fairly still in the glass with a hazed, orange pour and some spotty lace and a decent white collar. No lace.
Mild acidity and moderate funk in the nose. Nothing out of the ordinary, but solid.
Dry and extremely potent grapefruit meet the tongue. Yes it's acidic, but for me it never gets to the ethanoic acid, vinegar situation. Unsurprisingly the grapefruit lingers and the funk (horse) manifests itself again in the aftertaste. Too me this is one of the more drinkable Cantillon beers. It does NOT lack acidity, on the contrary, but it seems to balance things nicely and the citrus notes temper the potentially harsh notes.
Definitely a citric note, and the lemon and grapefruit peel and pith seem to temper the vinegar potential.
Tasty, and this might be a good beer to show people what a REAL lambic is without scaring the living crap out of them!"

Based upon reviews, I went for the Tucher Weizen glass - it seems appropriate, and that particular glass shows off virtually any beer very nicely. The body is a slighly hazed, rich golden one with a white head that fades quickly. I guess the lack of head can be at least partly attributed to the ABV. Nice stream of carbonation comes from the bottom of the glass in a persistent fashion.
Nose gives alcohol, cloves, lemongrass. Strong on the lemon notes.
Tastes are initialy reminiscent of a lager shandy from England. This means a cheap macro lager with English lemonade (7-UP/Sprite like carbonated lemony beverage) added. It quickly moves away from this to give a more sophisticated note. There is a slightly viscous mouthfeel and the alcohol begins to become a little more apparent. More herbal qualities start to come through which must be a combo of the juniper and the chai tea. The finish adds a welcome and tasty (but minimal) bitterness. 
In summary, very tasty, very drinkable and a nice combo of alcohol and tastes. As usual, a nice re-working of a well established style with a typical DFH twist."

Weak in the taste department. Very yeasty and bready but not in a good Belgian way. Again zero orange character which is a shame.

Out of the the capped and corked bottle (with no freshness date), it sits in the Brasserie l'Abbaye des Rocs chalice with a fairly ordinary presence with a brown body and some nice head. The head fades to give a collar and some film with minimal lace. Not really making itself known.
The nose offers some pretty strong fruit, with plums being the most obvious. Densely fruity with a touch of acidity.
The nose continues into the tastes quite faithfully. There is some big fruit upfront but fairly quickly we get a strongly acidic, slightly vinegary finish. It's not really offensive, but it is noticeably ethanoic acid in its nature! It also has a certain musty tasty which is reminiscent of old beer. Of course, with no freashness date of any description I have no idea how old this is. 
Creamy moutheffel completes the package.

Mild, simple hop profile in the nose which carries through to the taste. A malt profile that is quite large as well, which will probably upset some lovers of American IPA's. The balance is there, it's simple and it's, well...balanced! Imagine that! In that respect it is rather like its, superior, English origin. some noticeable fruit, notably peach and lemongrass.

Pour is a requisite blackish/brownish brown pour with those strage green highlights that a good stout sometimes produces (in my eyes at least!). A few ruby red highlights on standing. Head is small, poorly retained and doesn't create much lace - a bit of a let down considering the pretty nature of the body.
Nose has a simple, sweet balance that one would expect, with very mild hops competing with the dark malts for your attention.
A similar scenario plays out in the taste. A very light licorice, bitter finish completes the package. The malts are subtlely dark and roasted like a simple breakfast blend and without the harsh bitterness of a bolder brew. Some very fine, sand-like grains of yeast accompany the last pour from the bottle and settle at the bottom of the 16 oz glass. Quite creamy but paradoxically, also quite light in the mouth.
Tasty and one of the better beers from the RJR stable. Nice example. I'd like to try it fresher and on draft near the source. Would probably be be even better."

ST is a bit hit and miss to say the least with me, so it's always an interesting experience to open up a beer of theirs that I've no had before.
Pour yields a clear golden body with a frothy head. The whole thing seems a touch over-carbonated to me and the mouthfeel (prickly) confirms this.
The nose reveals some sweet hops, and to be honest it seems like the hops a re manifesting themselves a little too much.
The hop presence (too great IMO) is carried through to the taste. Whilst they certainly ARE plenty of Tripel elements (the sweetness, the slight peppery note, the alcohol, and the yeast), overall the package comes together in a way that is not typical of the style for me. There's too great a hop presence for my liking. That's NOT to say that this beer is ""hoppy"" as such, it isn't, but it seems to hop it's way a little out of style.
A little too much bitterness where sweetness should be, and a little too many hops where malts should be for me. Not a ""bad"" beer by any stretch of the imagination, but for me a touch ""off-style"" and for that I don't rate it highly.
Drinkable? Yes, but again not really a typical Tripel experience. Perhaps an example of the (fictious) ""American Tripel""! ;-)"

The pour is just the way I like it; it has that noisy, richness with a dark, caramel color. The head is high, rich, dense and produces some lovely ice-cream like lace.
The nose and tastes have light alcohol and some delicate touches of spice. After the caramel notes subside, there is a mild hop bitterness that comes across the tongue. Nothing too spectacular, but enough to keep me alert. It defines the finish and the aftertaste. It's an interesting mix of solid malts with a bittering finish. Tasty.
Fits very neatly into the Winter Warmer category from all angles. The alcohol kicks in at the end and the hops seem cumulative - pleasing, satisfying and a beer that basically delivers. This beer is six months old and the hops are pretty much where they should be for MY taste. IF there has been a significant drop in hop character since this was fresh then I am DELIGHTED that I waited on this one. A bigger hop character is NOT what I would want in this style or from this beer - I'm a genius! ;-)"

I'd be happy for a point or point and a half to be shaved off the ABV, but it still remains drinkable and has some sessionable quality in terms of its taste.

This should be interesting - a style that I am not crazy about, with the additional element of wood aging that I generally don't enjoy, from a brewery that I have enjoyed in the past, but lately has put out a couple of beers that I have been less than impressed with! We'll see.
Pour is mid-amber, perfectly clear body with an amazingly high head. The retention and lace are both excellent. Looks very good. The second pour is cleaner and beautiful.
Nose is very alcoholic with plenty of vanilla from the oak. It is surprisingly sweet and malty for a beer that sits in the DIPA category.
The sweet vanilla, the malty character and the oak are continued straight into the taste. The hops don't even manifest themselves in the finish - they kick-in in the aftertaste and then linger somewhat. The hops are strong, dry, bitter and soapy. Dry aftertaste lingers on a backdrop of even more oak. Alcohol warms and even burns a tad, too.
A unique beer that REALLY showcases the oak in a much better and more positive way than I recall from almost any other attempt. It honestly begins to provoke thoughts of similarly produced wines - not in the taste as such, but in the marriage of the beverage with the wood aging.
Having said all of the positive things above, it's by no means an easy beer to drink. The strong presence of all of the elements, coupled with the ABV makes it start to wear a little on the palate after about half of the bottle. I'm not surprised by that of course."

12 oz bottle shipped directly from Scotland by James. Many thanks.
Much the same as below. Still very good clarity and a decent amount of fruit amongst the (relatively) highly hopped tastes (at least for an English IPA). The lace is better than I have seen in the past.
Still drinks nicely, and although this is NOT my idea of a typical, English version of the style, I style think it's a decent beer.

22.4 oz bottle purchased from Showcase Beverage in Carrollton, GA, USA for the bargain price of $5.49 ($6.49 with a dollar off!). This is worth noting, since most other stores in GA are charging between $10.99 and $12.99 for this. At the higher price point, this beer is very poor value but at the discounted price it sits MUCH more comfortably with me.
Batch 003, best before 07/07/09. That typically, thick paper label and the usual nonsense from BrewDog as part of the spiel.
Poured into the Charleston Beer Exchange pint glass, the beer produces peach colored, hazed body with a small, poorly retained head and some minimal lace.
The nose is surprisingly sweet with some fruity malts and some light, floral hops.
The tastes are obviously much more hoppy than a traditional, English IPA but it DOES come with a lot of malt balance and support. The bitterness lingers a touch with some coinage in the finish, but at the end there are some fruits present too.
Having had two BrewDog offerings in the past (the Paradox and the Hardcore) and not really liking either, I was rather reserved about this. SURPRISINGLY I liked this one the best as it was somewhat reserved and much more ""British"" than the others. This is actually relatively subtle, and although the ABV is higher than one would expect (or that I would like), the beer is pretty tempered and has some sweet malty notes, some simple biscuity malts and some subtle hops that one might expect to find in an English Pale or ESB.
Tasty, enjoyable and the best of the stable so far."

Some light, estery fruits and perhaps a touch of a grassy organic nature, but if you were expecting a typical Saison (American OR Belgian), forget it!

The beer is actually rather sweet all around. Very malty and drinkable. There's something else in the beer which adds even more sweetness to the aftertaste but I'm having difficulty placing exactly what it is.
I think that you have to enjoy a sweeter beer to appreciate this and whether it fits classically into the APA category is a matter for some debate, but with the low ABV and my liking for malt based brews it means that this hit the spot for me.

The pop on opening was not big, and I wonder if this has lost a little carbonation over the years. The pour also lacks much life. The body is a orange/amber hazed affair with very little head to speak of. The lace is also not really part of the equation.
Nose and tastes have some sweet, oxidized sherry notes alongside the Belgian yeast and candy. The body lacks much depth and the alcohol shines through at the end. There are some really eathy tones that come through as well - a touch of soil, which is always a sign of an older beer. A little plum as well. It has some Old Ale character which would be fine if it were and Old Ale but for this beer it seems a little off. Some over-ripe bananas too.
Although I generally don't mind the oxidation, in this case it's not doing it for me. I'm absolutely positive that this beer is past its best which is a huge shame. I wish that I could have got to the beer either fresh or at least a lot earlier than I did. If you've got 'em, drink 'em and QUICKLY!"

Nose has a massive pear ester character. Absolutely HUGE! We still get the esters in the taste, but it is less pear based and more of a general alcoholic solvent. Some light, white pepper and spice, but not as large as some of the other reviews suggested.
If you like your BSPA's fruity then this is going to blow you away. If you prefer a more restrained fruit note with more pepper and spices with a drier character, then this is not going to work very well for you. This is a sweeter BSPA than most, and in that respect it certainly makes its own way.

An extraordinary beer in many ways. Firstly the color is essentially that of a Pale Ale or perhaps even an IPA. It has a mid-amber hue which would be fine if it were a beer that SHOULD look like that, but if you had asked me to categorize this, any type of ""wheat"" beer would have been my last guess. This is are recurring theme at HHB though, so God knows what they are doing with their malts and grains. Perhaps they are just using one thing for all of their beers. The next problem was the way it was presented - ABSOLUTELY flat with zero life. Zero head (and therefore zero retention and lace) was the way it arrived. It looked ilike dirty wash water.



Ironically the taste was the best part of the beer. It has a fairly strong blueberry element and was quite sweet. Malty presence was high and the beer drank relatively cleanly with no unpleasant aftertaste either. Not exactly my favorite style or my favorite fruit, but I thought it was palatable. Having said that, if I had been looking for wheat presence I would have been horribly disappointed.

OK, it's now a year old, but the total write-off that 14th is, inspired me to re-visit 13th. $6.49 from Highland Beverage, Hiram, GA, USA for the 22 oz bottle.
Stone suggest NOT to cellar this, but...
...not quite the clarity from a year ago, but still a great head and super retention. Really frothy and dense. Nice.
As expected the malts have come to the fore but it is still a beer that delivers a decent amount of bitterness, especially in the back end. Still a little burn in the chest on the way down. 13th retains balance though, and although it's not the same beer as it was a year ago, I still really like the brew.
Scores unchanged from the original review.

$6.49 for the 22 oz bomber from Charleston Beer Exchange, Charleston, GA, USA. The usual Stone presentation with the screen printed bottle and spiel.
Pour is a resplendent red with high head, excellent retention and spectacular lace. It looks superb.
The nose reveals massive West Coast hops but they are supported by malts and a body that can handle the assault.
Tastes are quintessential ""Imperial Red"". The American Amber/American Strong Ale category is one that can support this kind of barrage, and Stone is at the peak of its powers when it produces beers like this. As much as I enjoy Stone's Belgian takes, experimental beers and other beers, this is where their nascent genius really comes to the fore.
A bitter ATTACK on the tongue followed by a soft, gentle caress; a massive hop assault followed by a balance that is unique; a stormy cascade followed by a backbone of strength. This is the beauty of Stone. It reminds me of those initial moments with Double Bastard where my breath was momentarily taken away. 
The bitterness lingers and the alcohol and hops sting, but the combination is a bitter sweet, pleasure/pain experience.
Imperious. A truly great beer and my praise is not given lightly. Congratulations Stone."

Black , stout like body with a nice mocha head, decent retention and some lace. Ruby red highlights at the extremities.
Nose reveals an alcoholic chocolate and not much else.
The tastes lie heavily on the chocolate side of things with the coffee lending a certain bitterness but not much flavor. The coffee manifests itself in a licorice manner against the backdrop of the sweet, malty chocolate. 
Pretty smooth, but considering everything also pretty light. I was expecting something really dense and viscous and instead I got a beer that was significantly easier to drink than many others of the same, intense style and ABV. Talking of the ABV it was certainly present but in no way did it overwhelm the beer. Actually, I might even go as far as to say it was quite well hidden. Finishes with a blast of alcohol and a touch more bitterness. Not an ""easy"" beer to drink, but a lot easiER than you may anticipate.
Not a beer to have with any food other than desert, and probably a chocolate one at that! Outside of that it has to be consumed on its own, and the 22 oz bottle would be best shared with a friend.

Good, mild nutty nose and tastes with plenty of semi-sweet caramel notes. I would not call the flavors or nose particularly ""roasty"", but it obviously sits on the side of darker malts rather than any hop character. Smooth.

Pour is a mid-orange body (slight haze) with a high, frothy, cream soda/float like head. Lace is random. Decent retention.
The nose suggests (like the color) a dry-hopped IPA with some floral bitterness and a touch of brett. Drinkability is slow for me at first, but improves slightly as the bottle is consumed.
The tastes replicate the nose. To me, this is a very dry beer with essentially the feel and taste experience of a simple, American IPA. It's labeled as a ""Belgian Wild Ale"" and categorized on BA as a BSPA (which it ISN'T), but to me it drinks more like a Belgian IPA, and to be honest you'd be better off swapping ""American"" for ""Belgian"". The brett IS there, but to honest is feels like an afterthought. Finish is a little harsh and repeats the dry-hopped, bitter nature of the beer.
Think ""American IPA"" and I think you will be less surprised than I was in terms of what's in the bottle. To be honest, not really my cup of tea and I felt a little let down."

Very interested to try this, as I have a few of the Twelve Saison left. The Saison re-birth in the Anniversary series should prove interesting and the side-by-side tasting should prove enlightening.
Pour is a hazy, light lemon affair with initially a high head but it disappears quickly to a spotty film and little or no lace. 
Nose is floral (I guess from the Jasmine) and there is a little acidic tartness in there too. Definite, dirty funk with light, sweet manure as well. 
The tastes are all quite highly carbonated and the honey and light, summer fruits come to the fore. More floral notes in the taste (Peaches are a floral contributor to my palate) and more honey. Dry finish and the whole thing is brought together with some alcohol. Some phenolic tastes and other fruit esters as well.
The mouthfeel is smooth which is surprising given the high level of carbonation. Not prickly at all. 
Incredibly drinkable and a beer that is perfect for summer boozing and has crossover potential. Only downside for those two, potential uses is the ABV which at just under 8% kinda screws both thing up a bit.

OK, not really sure what's going on here, but I guess I will try to unravel it.
The pour offers a reddish, hazed body with little or no head except for a small collar. The head has poor retention (probably due in large part to the ABV) and the collar leaves a little lace. Carbonation seems low to me, but in line with a beer with this kind of alcohol.
What we have here is the proverbial ""kitchen sink"" beer. It comes across as a kind of American Double IPA/English Barleywine clone to me, with more sweetness than ANY American Barleywine has ever had. If you are judging this beer on its ability to replicate that particular style, then you have a failure. It also lacks the true, forward, aggressive hops that one would expect from an American DIPA as well, with plenty of caramel notes coming through and a tremendous (as in large rather than good), malt presence. Of course, it also lacks the subtle, sherry-like notes and nuances of an English Barleywine and therein lies the problem. This beer is neither one thing or another and tops of the whole package with a silly ABV. It's what I imagine a bad Stone beer to be!
Same problem as the original DP from 2007 in terms of the style being all over the place.
Two into the cellar, one more glass on draft and I'll be done. Much less impressive than Ron Burgandy and another American brewer's attempt to ""show off"" with massive ABV and just too much of everything but ultimately yielding next to nothing. Disappointing."

Light spice notes in the nose.
Taste are more dense than some Saison's with some citrus, marmalade tastes and a delicate notes of mace (or something similar). The Belgian yeasts and sugars are very dominant but also totally appropriate.
The finish is a touch tart and has the Saaz bitterness that I normally associate with a Pils. Clean and satisfying, this beer is *slightly* outside of the normal realm of Saison's in my opinions (it's got some phenol character that one might associate with a tripel), but it does fit at the edge of the style and it is a nice beer."

OK, let me give the summary right off the top. This beer is a VERY atypical American IPA. If you are looking for a representative beer in that style/category you are going to be disappointed, I on the other hand, am absolutely DELIGHTED with this beer.
Firstly it's great to have the added flexibility of craft beer in cans. Makes me wish that I found myself in situations where I really needed cans more often. This beer makes me think that I might deliberately find a few situations.
Light copper body with some significant haze. The head is magnificent and the lace is tremendous. Some of the best head and lace that I've seen in some time. Looks great.
The nose and tastes reflect a delicate, light hop touch and a balanced, sweet malt biscuit subtlety. It's a very nicely balanced beer with a kiss of hops in the finish and the aftertaste mellow and creamy.
This beer reminds me INTENSELY of an English Bitter. To be an exact replica we would need an ABV that was about 3 points lower, BUT the beauty of the beer is that it drinks very much like a beer that IS 3 points lower! Very smooth with a silky mouthfeel and drinkability is off the charts for me.

Interesting as I found this beer more substantial than the Weyerbacher Blanche that I drank alongside it - I was expecting the opposite to be true.
Mendocino has a habit of producing so fairly average (if solid) beers, followed by the occasional really good one. For me, the White Ale was one of the better efforts.
Pour was a murky, slightly orange affair with a solid head with good retention and lace. The beer looked solid in the Southampton Weizen glass.
Nose gives hints of what is to come in the taste with some significant orange notes and the usual spices. The beer drinks a touch bigger than one might think. Even a bit of viscosity in the body to back up the citrus based taste. Definitely more body and more depth of taste than many in the style, it drank nicely.
Very enjoyable, and a bit of a bigger brew than I was anticipating all around. Solid effort."

Light on taste, in fact rather sweet. Almost no rye taste when compared to some other beers that contain the grain. Simple malty, bread like notes.

Mild, sweet fruit in the nose. Seems balanced.
Strawberry juice is present in the tastes but it is fairly muted. Definitely the most reserved in terms of fruit of the three Smith's fruit beers (Cherry and Raspberry being the others). Sweet and sour which finishes quite dry. Malts dominate. Extremely drinkable in the Atlanta summer heat, but for me this is largely a novelty, very ocassional beer. Light, natural and not cloying, all important in a fruit based beer.

Very simple, mild citrus and a touch of spice (coriander ?) but not much else. Light tart finish. Very easy, light drinking but little to report here. Mouthfell is in line with the style and the carbonation is fine.
The Atlanta summer lends itself well to this kind of beer, but this is not a stand-out in any way, so it will probably just fit nicely into the normal rotation without much fuss.

Pour produces a very high, light head with very good retention and decent lace. The body is golden with a very slight haze. Light carbonation.
Nose is a fruity, funky, light alcohol that is pretty astringent. It smells a little like an overripe banana. It's a little strong.
Alcohol is very prominent in the taste, even to the point of being a touch solvent like. It drinks a lot easier than that but he taste is quite alcoholic. There's some light coriander notes, a touch of white pepper and the usual spices, but the overwhelming feeling that I get is that of the ""Imperialized"" version of the style. More squishy bananas round out the beer. It has a slightly slick mouthfeel but not as bad as it initially promised it could be.
I'm not sure about this one. It reminds me a little of the GD Saison which, because of the alcohol in that one, was a big miss with me. This was better, but it still sits a touch oddly with me. I think it comes down to the question, ""should this style be amped up?"" I suppose it CAN, but it is a VERY, VERY fine line between success and relative failure.

Beautiful, honey hazed, orange pour with a tight, white head. Lace is superb - dense with complex patterns. Some of the best I've seen in the Gouden Carolus chalice.
Nose has creamy fruits and white pepper.
Tastes are very mellow. Light touches of white pepper, some spices, gentle, ripe summer fruits like sweet peaches, pineapples and a floral backdrop. Extremely gentle grapefruit mingles with those flavors and the combination is exceptional. Some sweet and sour notes in the finish and this is where the spice manifests itself again. Light bitterness lingers for a few seconds after that mouthful.
It's extremely light and silky in the mouth. Satisfying, moreish and delightful. Full and blossoming.
Drinkability is helped by the light touch and the sensible, if slightly elevated ABV. Subtle is a word that comes to mind, which in itself is unusual for an American beer but this brew even goes beyond that. 
Quite possibly the best Lost Abbey offering I've had. Amazing."

Nose and tastes reveal a typical Fantome, funk and fruit, but this one lays more heavily on the fruit side of things for me. Very grape orientated with vinous note of chardonnay grapes coming through quite strongly. Without the funk it would remind me of Allagash Victor/Victoria.
Carbonation seems a touch on the low side, but it drinks simply and nicely with a very fruity finish. Definitely one of the fruitier Fantome's in the stable an din that respect a little atypical."

Pour gives a large, rocky head with is persistent and leaves tremendous lace. The body is a touch darker than I would like for the style, exuding a hazy, cloudy orange rather than the golden yellow I was looking for. Still, the combination is pretty good looking nevertheless.
Nose has a great combo of BIG Belgian style yeasts and some white pepper. Tremendous promise in the aroma.
Tastes reflect the nose which is great, but also add some Belgian candy notes. It's strange because the tastes tend to accentuate the sugar sweetness rather than the spicy pepper and yeast, which is a shame. Sweeter than the nose would suggest.
Still a very nice interpretation but I would advise a color adjustment and an emphasis in the taste that the nose would suggest. Still drinks extremely well, and is a really good effort at the real thing from an American brewer. Enjoyable and drinkable."

Big whiff of (what appears at first) to be a ""West Coast"" style hop profile. This does get toned down a little as the beer warms. This is repeated in the tastes and the beer drinks as though it's out of California to me. There's some residual sugary notes too, but to be honest this beer is what it is - a large DIPA with nothing much else going on.
Aftertaste lingers and is lightly metallic. Some great hoppy burps which for me are always a good sign of a solid, American DIPA.
This is a beer that I would need to have a craving for, and that happens infrequently. If you do get ""that"" DIPA craving then this is going to serve you well.

The beer pours like a Wheat/Hefe, with a cloudy, distinctly yellow color and a frothy, light, white head. To be honest it looks pretty good. After the appearance, things go downhill fast.
An insipid, plastic taste and smell come forth and of course the body is watery. It has a touch of fruity banana in there too, but is this an attempt at a Hefe?? I just don't know. There's just no character here at all. The odd artificial taste lingers to produce a funny aftertaste as well.
Depressingly, obviously marketing fodder for the masses.

Pour is an extreme clear solution with a modicum of bubbles. Head is disappointing and lace is non-existent.
Nose is typically macro-adjunct like with a boiled vegetal note. Tastes reflect that and are even more disappointing since I was anticipating some degree of honey-sweetness. As far as I can tell there is none of that, which, if it had been there, would have been a saving grace.

Served in a Gulden Draak tulip, the beer sits with a brownish-red body and a small head that disappears quickly. Better lace than I was anticipating.
Nose and tastes do a great job of replicating the style nicely, but at the same time give a degree of accessibility that is somewhat unusual for this style (hence the high drinkability score). Light vinegar in the nose and a delicate sourness on the tongue at first. It's fairly one-dimesional to me, but that's OK since there is balance with a touch of tart fruitiness/fruit skins in there too. Obviously some tannin character too with a dry, tea like ending.
To me this is a beer which doesn't do much other than what the style demands (a good thing) and also remains approachable. It's the kind of beer that I *think* could be used as a crossover, or at least an opportunity to introduce a non-craft beer person to a dramatically different style without scaring the life put of them. Don't get me wrong, it IS a beer that would scare some, and I know it's generally not a style that can act as a gateway brew, but in the grand scheme of the style it's very approachable.

I've been fairly critical of SN in the past for over-hopping their beers so that so many of them taste so similar (The Harvest series, SNPA, Anniversary series, Torpedo, ESB, to some extent even celebration etc., all seem like clones of the same, hoppy-based beer to me with little or no imagination), so I always approach their beers with a degree of skepticism to say the least. However, on this ocassion we got a really nice brew.
I'm not really sure where the saison element comes in with this beer becasue to me it drank purely and simply like a solid, English Brown Ale. What does that mean? Well, malt based, sweet, medium to high body with a solid refreshing blast. Light roasted flavors and a lingering finish that leaves you wanting more. It poured in the same manner by looking substantial and giving an excellent rocky, off-white head and some decent lace. Alcohol is well hidden although, of course, I wish it were ACTUALLY lower in ABV rather than just TASTING lower in ABV.
As I say, I don't really understand the saison part of this beer, but if you are looking for a sweet, malty brew I'd say this was a good bet. Highly quaffable too. Take 3-4% off the ABV and you'd have a pretty good, sessionable Englishesque beer."

Nose and tastes give a grainy sweetness with some simple, English biscuit malts but not much else. Some light fruits. Great drinkability in the Atlanta heat, BUT this beer is a worry to me. In the first instance it seems to have crossed the line from Pale Ale into the contemporary, English ""Golden Ale"". I am beginning to hate that ""style"" since I see it as nothing more than an effort on the part of the brewers to bow to lowest common denominator demand by dumbing down their Pale Ales and Bitters to macro lager like extents. I FULLY understand that brewers need to make a profit, and that they need to respond to consumer demand, but it pains me when brewers like Bateman's seem to be giving in - a sign of the Apocalypse?
I dunno, I guess the brewers are not really to blame, it's more a function of the dumbed down public in the face of macro lager advertising, but I am still bothered by it. I just don't think that Bateman's would have brewed a beer that tasted like this 5 or 10 years ago.

Nose reveals a touch of grassy herbal hops.
Tastes are quite bitter. Almost a Saaz like pils finish as well. Finishes dry and bitter too.
This is a surprisingly bitter beer which is not necessarily a bad thing. It has more character than I was expecting and definitely fits the profile for a summer, hot weather sessionable beer. I use the word ""sessionable"" with caution since I don't know the ABV. I'd like to know what it is. It seems like it IS sessionable, I just we'll see!

Popping the cap produces a touch of gunsmoke but the pour produces a pretty lively beer. Some really substantial, thick, bubbly head that lingers and leaves good lace. Body is a slightly murky, dark Dubbel like affair. 
Nose is quite frankly not huge, but it does give a strong whiff of a hop base rather than a Belgian fruity/estery/yesty/candy note. I suppose this is in line with the De Ranke philosophy.
As is so often the case, the tastes largely reflect the nose with fruits, raisins and esters, whilst although present, taking a backseat to the hoppy edge that makes a De Ranke beer, a De Ranke beer! Finishes with a malty bitterness which is an unusual combo. There's a touch of lingering metallic coinage too, but it's not harsh and adds to the experience rather than detracting from it. As it warms the esters and yeasts come to the fore with greater alacrity and clarity.
Insanely drinkable, the alcohol is nowhere to be seen.
Definitely an edgy BDSA, and not the kind of thing that I usually go for since I feel the fruit, the esters, yeasts and malts should be upfront and strong in this style, BUT given it is a De Ranke I was expecting this so I feel less disappointed than I otherwise might have.

Deliberately poured into a wine glass rather than a beer snifter.
Toffee colored body with a minimal amount of bubbly head and lace. Beer sits still in the glass. Swirling produces some fantastic alcohol legs on the glass.
The nose is beautifully subtle and rich. Chocolate, cocoa, light raspberries, Madiera and sherry notes too. As the beer warms there are more and more raspberries that come to the fore. Some dry, baking chocolate in there too.
The tastes are SILKY smooth with a big rush of alcohol upfront and then raspberry seeds in the back end. Finishes surprisingly dry, but I assume that this is another function of the raspberries.
It drinks like a classy liquer and is perfect for a digestif. Other beers are sometimes touted in the this role but most don't fit the bill. For me, this one does and it reminds me of a (somewhat dry) Madeira. Alcohol is present and warming but perfect for the beer.

Ginger is present in very light amounts, but the beer is definitely herbal. The general spice is quite strong with the specific ginger notes a touch more muted. Some yeasty, Belgian candy mixed in too. Pretty mild, and except for the obvious herbal qualities the beer is what I would characterize as ""neutral"".
Drinks very much like a traditional Ginger beer, and in that respect is rather odd, especially for a Belgian beer. Ignoring that for a moment it is incredibly drinkable and a really nice summer, quaffing, crossover beer.

The beer is a little odd in as much as the mouthfeel is rather light, lacking depth, and in that I get a distinct licorice like finish exploding across the back end.

Nose has plenty of fruit notes (cherry, pineapple and apple) but all are laced with a slightly sour character.
The beer drinks with some of those fruity characteristics, but more light vinegar and sourness than the nose would suggest. There is a dry character too, which is a bit like white wine or even champagne. Seems ""classy"". Finish continues with a real, sweet and sour combo.
Acidic fruits are the watch-words here, and the beer is very nicely balanced between the two. I would describe it as a cross between a really sour lambic and a fruit beer. Quite a strange combination, but it comes together rather well.
Nice beer, unusually and tasty, but ridiculously expensive and it that regard very poor value for money."

Hazy orange body sits underneath a white, bubbly head that forms quickly on top. A thin film is left on the beer as the pour settles. No lace in the Terrapin snifter.
Nose and tastes are dominated by citrus hops. The rye takes a back seat, and at first I would not have put his down as anything other than an American IPA. The dry finish gives the rye away somewhat, but outside of that the beer takes on a typical, fairly harsh American IPA stance.
It's a pretty aggressive beer in terms of bitterness, but I would say that it IS in check but not really my particular cup of tea. I don't dislike the beer, but I do not find it easy to drink. A touch hot in terms of alcohol too (not it terms of the size of he ABV, but rather in terms of its presence). Lingering bitterness is the overwhelming experience here.
I dunno, not a bad beer but I find it quite harsh - not subtle, and not one that makes for easy drinking."

Firstly there is a huge reference to cherries from the name through to the picture of the giant fruit on the bottle, and secondly there is the oaking of the beer which, even before I tasted it gave me some serious reservations as to why one would be trying to combine that with a fruit infused saison. I was just afraid that it would not come together at all well, and I was right.
Pour is a hazed orange; fairly typical for the style, but what's the deal with the fruit? You would expect the cherry to add some kind of color (even artificial looking), but no, there's nothing. Head is OK, some lace.
Nose gives a pleasant, light vanilla note on top of the alcohol and mild grassy, organic nose.
Then we get to the tastes. For me this beer was close to undrinkable as the oak notes overpowered everything else that the beer was trying to do. Dry and VERY strong, it tasted a bit like chewing on matchwood. Very uninteresting, and the second half of the bottle was a drain pour for me. VERY unusual for me to do that, but I just couldn't get this one to go down. My guess is that ST was trying to introduce a sour note with the cherries; fine, but why then overwhelm the beer with the oak too? There was no hint of cherry either artificial or natural for me. It's an example of trying too hard and being too clever.
Odd combination out of the gate and the whole thing is a bit of a disaster in my book. It failed to come together - failed experiment."

Good looking, dark garnet pour that form a nice, tight, white head, some lace and a nice stream of carbonation. Looks solid in the glass.
Nose reveals dark malts, sweetness and some alcohol, but again is fairly solid.
Tastes are in style, BUT two things;
The body lacks depth for me. In a SA/WH I'm looking for a considerable richness and this beer comes up a notch short for me.
The tastes are close, but the alcohol seems WAY TOO prevalent for me. I'm not saying that we should be looking for a lower ABV, but I am saying that we should be looking for a less obvious EtOH presence. I'd even go as far as to say it begins to take on a bit of a solvent like finish. Lacks smoothness.
This short-coming also manifests itself in the mouthfeel which, for the style seems to lack depth and is a touch thin.

Big C hops with a touch of citrus lime and grapefruit come down. A touch of orange peel, or is that the color playing tricks on my mind? Clean tasting beer but also enjoys a ligering, bitter, slight coinage finish and aftertaste - all well in check so enjoyable.

A bit of a strange brew to say the least. Not sure how I would categorize it but it seemed to me like a cross between a brown ale and an IPA. To me, that generally means ""American Brown Ale"" with some of the appearance of a brown, but a hoppier presence that would otherwise be expected in such a beer.
There are some dark malts present up front, and given SN's liberal use of hops all over the place, I was expecting a bitter blast coming at me to accompany the mellower start. Although some bitterness did come through, all in all it was actually LESS hoppy than I expected, GIVEN SN's usual heavy-handedness.
Nice lace and a well sustained head, the beer has some nice balance and to be honest I enjoyed more than I thought I would. Decent drinkability, it slid down a little quicker than I was expecting. Interesting, and glad I got to try it."

Nose and tastes are mainly simple, pale malts and the beer drinks in a similar manner, but it has a really astringent, dry rye note that is a bit overbearing. I'm not a huge fan of rye in general but this seems way out of balance. I didn't like it at all.
The finish is not clean either, and it leaves an unpleasant tannin like feel coating the teeth.

I first came across the cherry version of this, bottled in London in the summer of 2007. I quite enjoyed that, so I thought it would be a good bet that I would like the raspberry and strawberry version recently arrived in the US - started with the Raspberry.
500 mL bottle from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA. $5.99. 
The beer pours with an amazingly deep, crimson color and a HIGH, pinkish head. Decent lace. Doesn't look a great deal like beer, but it IS exceptional in its appearance, hence the ""5"". Carbonation seems high at first but settles down to be more ""beer-like"".
Nose has an acidic fruitiness that I would not necessarily associate with raspberries, but it does smell fruit based and not ""fake"". Seems natural.
Lots of raspberries in the taste and up front that is all that one can really experience, BUT as the beer drinks down the bottle I find that the fruit notes begin to fade a little, more dry, almost lager like malts start to come through. By the end of the bottle the beer is finish more like beer than fruit juice.
In the end it is VERY drinkable, but it IS a context/novelty beer for me. Sam Smith's has obviously taken the low road here and gone for the combo market of women, youngsters, summer, novelty, organic and sweetness. I'd imagine that in those markets this will do well. I prefered the cherry version; strawberry is up next."

Pour is a surprisingly well carbonated golden, clear body underneath a rocky id somewhat flimsy head. A multitude of bubbles accumulate on the inside of the glass.
BIG fan of te ABV which adds to the drinkability of this beer and saves it for me a little.
It drinks a little like a macro lager to be honest. Some cleaner lines that one might expect to find in most of those, but nevertheless it's very light, carbonated drinking. The carbonation bothered me a touch. Although this is clearly described as a wheat beer, it's a wheat beer where the wheat is not really evident much at all. In that respect it's a little confusing.
In the end it's fine, but I don't care for this beer a great deal and NOT because of its simplicity, more because of the strange level of carbonation and the ""wheat"" confusion."

Anyway, it can be moved if it does turn out to be an alias of a beer already in the db (I am pretty sure this is NOT the Honey Wheat currently listed).

http://beeradvocate.com/forum/read/2002198



Pour is a pale, clouded yellow with excellent carbonation, a nice head and some lace. Large amount of yeast sediment in the bottom of the bottle that gets transferred to the glass.



Nose is reminiscent of a traditional, British shandy and the tastes reflect that to an extent too. VERY light citrus and a sweetness that you can attribute to the honey. The orange peel comes through less in terms of the taste, and more in terms of a dry, bitterness that one associates with mixed peel.



Soft mouthfeel with the bitterness slightly accentuated in the finish.



Hard to put the glass down on a warm, summer, Atlanta day, I would say the drinkability is very high. Lots of character, and a satisfying, tasty offering from Rogue. Not really a typical Rogue beer by any stretch of the imagination, and in this case, that's a good thing!"

Amber body that could pass for a brown ale from a distance.
Of the three (the orange the lemon and the cola) this is the one that is closest to actually being ""beer-like"", but to be honest this is still an abomination.
The head on this is the best of the three but there is still no lace. The head leads to a slightly less soda-like mouthfeel and the taste of cola is less aggressive than the orange and the lemon versions. 
Still very shandy/lemon/Radler like, and is again reminiscent of my days as a kid supping on half-pints of shandy that my dad would buy for me. In that respect I may even drink this again (if it was $0.99 for the bottle or free) since it has a nostalgic edge for me. For those of you who would not get that feeling it's best to avoid this!

To me this doesn't really differ very much at all from the original. I would say there is a subtle touch of vanilla which smooths the beer out a little, but any adjustments that the oak has made to the original are hardly noticeable to me.
Still, large hops and solid malt backbone, I really feel this could almost be the original - perhaps it is!? Good hoppy burps as usual - tasty but one is sufficient for me."

22 oz bottle that on opening creates a small spew of foamy discharge.
Poured into the Gouden Carolus chalice, the beer has a very deep, rich butterscotch hue, thin film of head that is produced after the aggressive pour that produces the head recedes somewhat.
Nose is soaked in oak but still managaes to remain subtle. A very good sign.
This is what I really want to say about Prophecy;
I am REALLY dissapointed in this as a TRIPEL. The oak overwhelms the subtle Belgian sweetness and yeast that one should expect, and the beer fails horribly on that front. On the other hand...
....the beer is a MASSIVE triumph in terms of oak-aging. Time, after time, after I have been horribly disappointed with American oak-aged beers as the tastes completely overwhelm the palate and wreck the senses on the rocks of the ignorant, the crass, the overbearing, and the non-subtle. Often these beers reject the all too difficult to find tempered ground that American beers of this type throw away with depressingly regularity. This however does a GREAT job in terms of oaking and REALLY hits the spot in terms of subtlety. Surprising and delightful.
Specifics: alcohol is nowhere to be seen, but vanilla and subtle oaks are EVERYWHERE - beautiful.
I'm confused! This is a poor Tripel, but a really great beer; it's an all-to-difficult to find, subtle example of oaking and for that I love it. I guess that in a nutshell it would be better as simply categorized on its own as an ""oak-aged beer"".

Pour is a hazed, well carbonated mid-orange. The carbonation does not lead to much (if any) head or lace - probably due to the ABV.
Nose is very big on honey but even bigger on the floral, herbal, band-aid medicinal, phenolic notes. Pretty extraordinary!
The strong attributes of the nose are tempered in the taste with honey coming through again but not the other qualities. Some alcohol but absolutely nowhere near 11% - amazing! Obvious comparisons with meads are both valid and understandable.

I REALLY wanted to like this since at 3.9% this kind of beer is just about impossible to find in the US. Unfortunately it was DIRE.
Appearnace was jst the usual, nasty macro, ho head, no lace, watery pour. Again, nose (virtually nothing) was as expected and par for the style/course. Mouthfeel was from the same stable, but again not to disappointing since, (a) it supposed to be somewhat like that, and (b) that was what i was expecting, however the tastes were a different matter. 
Essentially I got a fused, plastic, utterly unfathomable, utterly odd, utterly disgusting combo. about 4 oz was all I could take and down the drain it went. Close to undrinkable, this is one of the very few commercial beers (most BMC products included) that I LITERALLY found impossible to consume. Nasty in the first degree.

On opening there is a small amount of dense gushing. Poured into the Young's 20 oz pint glass, we get a butterscotch orange hazed beer, with that soapy, spotty, large bubbled head that is typical of the style and the ABV. Some nice lace.
Nose is big on resinous hops but they seem to be quite sweet and less aggressive than some in the same style. However, once I get a taste of the beer I am taken back about five or six years ago when I first tasted a ""West Coast style"" DIPA. This style is a fine line for me. There is a suitably appropriate, slightly cloying sweetness BUT it remains manageable. Also we get that sweet sinus clearing grapefruit. Serious alpha aromas and a surprisingly well balanced beer come across the palate and the other sense to make a delicious combo.
Alcohol is very well hidden and the combo yields a very drinkable, delicious example of the style.
As I say, this style walks a fine line for me but this beer really pulls it off incredibly well. For me, perhaps NOT an absolutely quintessential example of the style (it's not as aggressive as some would like, nor is it as bitter as many), but for me it's one of the more accessible and SENSIBLE examples.

Poured this one into the Gouden Carolus, small chalice. The beer looks near perfect. Beautiful, dark mahogany clarity with a super, rich, dense mocha colored head. Lace is not huge, but some exists. It looks very much like the beer that the glass was made for.
Up front we get the alcohol, honey and the usual rich, dark fruits associated with the style. As those flavors meld, they seem almost quintessential for the style, that is until the finish. At first taste this seems almost like a sour note, but within seconds I can recognize it as the strong herbal characteristics that must come from the rosemary. It's very strong, distinct and delicious and for a few minutes I struggle to place where I have experienced this before. As I get to the end of the glass it comes to me - Cinzano Bianco! For those who are not aware this is an Italian vermouth that is/was infused with herbs such as artemisia (wormwood), cinnamon, cloves, citrus and gentian. This was very popular (at least in England) in the late 70's, but quickly fell out of favor as it became somewhat passe. Anyway...this reminds me of that very much especially in the finish and the aftertaste.
At the end of the bottle there is a touch of funk in the form of a lactose milk sourness that I could really do without, but it really doesn't detract too much, the herbal qualities have won me over.

Nice lace form the 12 oz bottle into the 20 oz, Youngs (real) pint glass.
Relatively light and subtle with good, orange color and mild alcohol. There are big floral notes in the nose and tastes for me that accentuate the light touch with the hops and meld weel with the malt backbone. Floral is the lingering memory of this beer.
Ultimately this beer represents a simplier version of the often, over-complicated American version of the style, and seems to take the beer a little more back to its contemporary, English heritage. Very drinkable and extremely refreshing.
I enjoyed this more than I thought that I would, good stuff, not just another over-hyped, over-hopped American IPA. Tasty."

Missed this when it was on draft at The Brick Store in Decatur so this will have to do! It's a hard life! ;-)
Pour is a butterscotch body on top of an impressive (if somewhat light), frothy head. Lace is OK, but not great. Large amount of sediment in the bottom of the bottle, but it does not produce a huge amount of cloudiness - odd.
Nice funk in the nose and the beer is impressively smooth and drinkable. Like all high quality beers of this nature it reminds me very much of a real, English, south-western (Somerset/Devon) cider, and my youth. Tasty, refreshing and moreish, the beer cuts across the palate gently as it warms. Light lemon, lingering tartness and a nice, gentle, maure farmyard/horse blanket finish.
Very impressed, delightfully tasty and a joy to drink BUT at the price I NEED all of those attributes. Those are non-negoitables!
Tasty, but an expensive beer to be honest, and beers that cost a fraction of the price do the job nearly (or just) as well. I still have great respect for this, and I think it is an astonishingly good beer, but the price tag takes the edge off for me a touch. It's strange because this is really a market force issue - I actually think that it IS worth the price, BUT Allagash has a problem since there are several other beers that deliver a similar experience at lower cost."

Nose and tastes have the good, nutty, moreish character I was expecting. Malt based (obviously) it drinks above a broken, spotty head.

It's a HUGE shame since the nose and taste of this brew are really quintessential. Plenty of raisins and figs, set against a slightly dry finish and fruity Belgian yeast. Esters also present, and in terms of the tastes we get a really nice interpretation of the style. Mouthfeel is DREADFULLY disappointing though, and as I say, the beer ""dies"" on the palate.

Mouthfeel is a little viscous with the alcohol popping through both in the taste and in the slightly slick feel in the mouth. A touch of caramel and definitely some honey.
Some hop bitterness mingles with a fruity backdrop. Some malts come through as well, and there is plenty of sweetness for balance. Drinks quite richly, and there is a definite fruit note that I can't quite put my finger on. Dry finish completes the classy nature of this beer.

Delighted to see one of my favorite styles produced by a brewer that usually does a very solid job across the board. Bottle sports the usual, new GD artwork and red foil on the neck - nice.
Noisy pour (good sign), and a nice head with lace is produced. A murky, mid-brown pour is the result that is not very attractive but standard for the style.
It's very straightforward in terms of the nose and the taste. We get all the standard clove and banana notes and plenty of sweetness that ends with a touch of bitterness in the finish. Not QUITE there in terms of depth and mouthfeel (a bit light), but outside of that it's a good example of the style.

Pour is a lot darker than I was anticipating. Getting toward black. Head and lace are ultimately, largely absent.
In terms of the nose and the taste there really isn't much more here than a alcohol inspired malt bomb. Now, one might think that is somewhat one-dimensional, but in the context of the style this just about covers the bases.
The re seems to be a touch of vanilla in there too, but ultimately this hits the spot in a simple, unassuming way and in that respect it works well.

I think I would even struggle to drink this in the heat of a Georgia summer while grilling on the deck at 110 degrees - that's saying something!
In a nutshell, IMO it's a womans drink/beer that may even ""miss"" with the masses.

Nose has very mild, apple based Brett funk, but it's pretty reserved.
It's much sweeter than I was anticipating. Obviously there is some mild funk in there, but to be honest the IPA notes continue to come through strongly. As the beer drinks and warms, it becomes increasingly IPA like with grapefruit mixing in amongst the mild funk.
Not sure about this, it comes up a bit short, falls between two stools and really ends up being a bit of a novelty gone wrong. It's as if Victory are trying to be a little too clever. No point in messing around with Hop Devil really."

Light solvent alcohol in the nose but with some sweetness.
The tastes are really quite light too, and definitely sit on the side of milk chocolate rather than dark. It's not really very aggressive at all and it reminds me more of an alcoholic porter. Very creamy and well rounded. Mouthfeel is perhaps the best feature of this brew. There is a little more alcohol and dark raisin-like character in the back end but to be honest this is very approachable.
Nowhere near as potent as some in the style, and the beer drinks easily. Very unusual for me that I could imagine myself drinking more than one of these in a session.

In a nutshell this beer is, for me, just about as quintessential as one is likely to get outside of Dusseldorf.
Magnificent clarity underneath the bone white head and superb lace and just the right amount of carbonation to make the beer feel alive but not enough to make it prickly. There is a definite reddish/orange hue to the beer that mingles with the more classic, brown colors.
The classic stamp of an Alt is always the malt balance. The malts a beautifully balanced her and they offer a light, nutty refreshing quality that is unusual in many American made beers. Definitely crafted with a subtle touch.
Drinkability for me was huge, with the bottle gone in just a few minutes. Very smooth, moreish and satisfying, a very, very nice beer."

Pour is a promising, orange hazed affair with better head and lace than I initially thought I was going to see.
Nose gives gentle citrus in the form of grapefruit and not much else.
Tastes reflect the nose but with a pretty healthy dose of pepper along with the grapefruit, and a fairly harsh, dry, bitter ending. There is not a hint of sweetness which for me means that this is NOT a Tripel by any stretch of the imagination. Belgian IPA perhaps, but the preponderance of hops mean this beer seems well-entrenched on the American side of things rather than the Belgian.
As it warms more floral notes come through.
It's not a bad beer, and I quite enjoyed it, BUT I was mildly disappointed because this is in no way a Tripel. The sweetness and the Belgian yeast character is largely missing for me. I wanted to like it much more since I wanted far more Belgian character. A Tripel ought to be a Tripel in my book, and this ain't one."

Nose and tastes reveal a heady mixture of musty malts, spices and a winter warmer note. The spices seem to be hop based and there is a real combo of dark fruits and bitterness that come together nicely.
I'm not sure that this is really a traditional bock as such, in fact along with the name it would seem much better suited to be called a winterwarmer, BUT nevertheless it has some nice depth of flavor and feel and it even warms a little on the back end. A nice malt based aftertaste too.

Pour gives a lemon/butterscotch color with a disappointing head, disappointing lace and pretty much no retention. Just not good enough for the style.

A light acid in the aroma but the failure of this beer is in the taste. It is AMAZINGLY watery and lacks any organic, hay/grass note as well. Impact = zero. It quite literally feels, tastes and drinks like a watered down Hefe. Not offensive in any way, but dreadfully shallow.

Nose has the pre-requisite light fruit and IPA notes. The Belgian yeasts and sweetness are simple and subtle rather than massive, and the same is true of the hoppy notes. The bitterness and hop character only really cut in in the aftertaste, and the combo makes this very drinkable.
I really enjoyed this beer for a couple of reasons. Firstly it was understated. I am SO tired of huge, massive, uncomprimising flavors in American brews. Secondly I feel this is true to style. Thirdly it's well made and revels in its own simplicity."

Hazed, amber appearance this has a Dubbel like murky brown apperance. 



Head is not large, but it does give some really nice, sticky lace.



Nose is a fruity (pineapple), bubblegum and alcohol mix and this finds it's way into the taste. The bubblegum is very strong in the taste as is the booze. It drinks all the way up there at 8-9%.



Drinks with plenty of Dubbel/Tripel like fruit, but the finish brings the hops and this beer goes from some estery Belgian character up front to a solid American Strong Ale in the back end. Interesting combo I suppose, but this is not really my cup of tea and a beer that, like many of its style, tries to do too much. It's a little busy and it does reflect the multitude of ingredients.



One is plenty for me before the palate starts getting a touch weary.

OK, right off the top this *could* be an infected bottle so this review is written in that context. Re-reviews to follow when more data is gathered but for now I want to record my thoughts at this stage. Take it or leave it, but it would be interesting to see if anyone has had a similar experience.
===
VERY disappointing lack of pop on opening. Clearly there is a carbonation issue here, but as we all know, LA has had its fair share of issues with this.
Carbonation is simply not there. The body is an orange, murky affair that doesn't strike me as anything like a classic, BSPA. No head and lace obviously.
The nose has some orange marmalade and mild funk. This carries through to the taste where there is a complicated mix of light funk, sourness, alcohol, fruit and bitterness. It's interesting to me, because although it is miles away from a classic Belgian Pale, it does sort of produce an interesting combination of woody, cider infection and a touch of funk.
The cider-woody, apple-cider notes are typical of an infected beer, but paradoxically the drinkability of the beer still stays reasonable.
I dunno, my suspicions are aroused simply because of LA's issues with carbonation but maybe this is what they intended! It's difficult to know."

It seems to have some diacetyl in the finish too.
Pretty unimpressed all around. If you are looking for a genuine Rauchbier I wouldn't be looking here; if, on the other hand you want to drink a typical Rogue beer that has a bit of smoke character then you'll be pleased. For me, no thanks."

Great light floral, hoppy nose with a sweetness in the nostrils.
Exactly the same in the taste. Super hoppy burps, but a real light touch (for a change) from an American DIPA. NO huge ""smack-you-round-the-face"" west coast notes here, rather this is a floral based beer but still with an emphasis on some syrup based, lightly cloying sweetness. Sweetened grapefruit certainly but with honey-lemon undertones. It reminds me a little of some of the taste associated with my first Houblon Chouffe with that Tripel sweetness in there somewhere.
This is one of those beers that I bet is difficult to make. It flirts (successfully) with bigger things but still manages to achieve a degree of subtlety and class - not a combo that one finds too often in American beers period, and even less likely in a beer that is categorized as an American DIPA.
The finish is a sweet, gentle hop extravaganza, but again with careful, subtle undertones.

Pour is a mid-orange that lacks much head unless the pour is pretty agressive. Seems a touch under-carbonated to me. No lace.
Aroma is, errr....floral! No surprises there, then.
Tastes are floral yes, but ultimately it plays out as a floral based, sweetened grapefruit. It reminds me of a Dandelion & Burdock, which again is hardly a huge surprise BUT is an enormously nostalgic moment for the English amongst us. Simple, syrupy sweet mouthfeel and a satisfying alcholic taste. The alcohol is more of a taste rather than a presence, but it is noticeable.
As anticipated, although I really enjoyed the drinkability and the light nature of this beer, it DOES get a little tiring by the end of the bottle. I'm not sure that this is a criticism though, since I was anticipating the floral note to be a little grating at the end of the large bottle. Not an easy thing to consume a lot of, but it just about holds it together for the duration of the 750.

Much less smooth than regular Guinness and it lacked any kind of silky mouthfeel.
Many more bitter notes than I was expecting as well. Thinner feel overall and a bit of a disappointment to me. The beer seemed to give a edgier feel than I was expecting and an increased level of tannins and dark roasted notes. Certainly hoppier than the regular pint.

Poured into the Southampton Weizen glass the beer produces a pretty decent head. It lacks much creamy density but it is well formed (if light) but does not produce much lace. The body is a surprisingly thin, bright yellow macro-like pour but has some cloudy presence.
Nose has some acidity and some light funk/lemon.
Tastes are quite like an adjunct lager! It isn't until the finish that we get some greater acidity and more funk. A dry finish builds from the middle of the beer and reaches a crescendo in the back of the beer. Quite a lot of unbalanced bitterness.
Mouthfeel has a creamy nature which pulls it briefly away from the macro-lager situation that some of the other characteristics seem to have built.
WOW - odd. I'm not sure what the Great Divide boys have really achieved here. It's a bit like a lemony macro lager! I'm genuine surprised at how poor this seems to be in some aspects for the style. Another visit maybe? By GD's standards, not a very good beer."

Took my own regular advice and paired this with a decent curry from The Viceroy. Despte some pretentious suggestions about IPA's and the like being paired with curry, after years and years of drinking beer with curry, I fail to find a better combo of the cheap, macro adjunct lager and a great Ruby.
Appearance is as expected with a golden clarity, well carbonated body and the usual short-lived, wispy head that fades to not much. There was a touch of lace.
The usual adjunct lack of araoma, and bland, vgetal notes but all in all for the job it was asked to do it was perfect. Tastes are well, not really there, but it pairs well and offers a refreshing cut across the dense spice.

The sharp, tart grapefruit notes caught me by surprise as I was not expecting them. They were tasty and enjoyable but just not what I had in mind. A few earthy notes which unfortunately lend a bit of a musty/old taste to the brew.
Much more bitter (and tasty) than your average pale ale, and it had th hop twang of a Saaz based Pils or perhaps even a very light IPA. The body, tastes and overall feel was very light but the taste packed a punch that punched well above its weight. Interesting and drinks nicely."

Pour is black - I mean black! A few red highlishts at the extreme edges, but barely there.
Head is minimal, but it fades to a nice, 1/8 of an inch layer on the beer which is persistent and creamy. Almost no lace. 
The beer has some, licorice, dark notes and a touch of roastiness but all in all it's rather light. The word ""Imperial"" is a little misplaced here. Some light soap present as well.
If you are looking for a deep, high alcohol, massive, Imperial Porter then you are going to be disappointed.

The body is also light for the style, but again this adds to the drinkability for me.
I bet a lot of people will be disappointed in this beer, but not me. Good, simplier than expected, stuff."

Poured into the Duvel tulip (seemed like the most natural glass) it forms a lovely, whipped ice-cream head with nice lace on top of a golden body - very Duvel like!
Nose is classical - Belgian yeasts, light sugars, alcohol, a touch of pepper and all the esters that you would expect.
Tastes replicate the nose and the tastes, BUT it's drier, a tad warmer (in terms of alcohol), a touch more bitter and a touch less fruity than the nose suggested. Nice marmalade, citrus bitterness in the finish and the aftertaste. I prefer something a touch sweeter, but for me it's still a very nice beer just don't expect a lot of sweet character.
Easy drinking and it basically boils down to a very nice BSPA. Not perfect, but classic in many respects so depending on price and mood, I might reach for it again."

Poured into the DFH palm glass, the tan head is disappointing in terms of retention and lace, but at the same time not that surprising considering the ABV. The carbonation seems especially low on this one.
Nice garnet pour with good clarity. 
Very simple malty notes dominate but I get a lot of blackberry in the taste. It lacks the classic, marzipan depth but it retains the tastiness. Surprisingly light drinking in terms of the taste, and the alcohol seems well hidden in most of the drink. The ending does impact some more heat but I am surprised at the general lack of anything really big.
Not as deep in terms of malt compared to what I was expecting, but at the same time it still drinks well. A bit of a fruitier/lighter Doppelbock than usual, but still a nice beer."

The head is small a slightly disappointing especially considering the foamy nature of the bottle opening. The body is a little drab too - a murky brown that lacks much excitement or life.
This is a strange brew that ultimately misses for me. It seems to get caught between two stools with the fruity, dark Belgian notes being present, but they also sit awkwardly with the malty sweet, mildly smoky peat notes of the Scotch Ale. Both sets of attributes ARE there, but I think the Belgian yeast sits awkwardly with this style. This is a common problem when melding Belgian yeast character with non-Belgian styles.
The mouthfeel is also rather thin.
I was disappointed because the malty side of things is one I generally favor and I absolutely love a good Belgian Dark, but this didn't come together well and so it was a miss for me. It's a shame."

Very prominent orange and honey notes in the nose and taste. I get quite a syrupy mouthfeel which for me is at odds with the light taste of the beer and it all sits a little oddly. It's strange because the alcohol is not present overtly in the taste, but it is in the mouthfeel.
The beer is very sweet and thick and drinks every part of its 7.5% for me. I don't really get how in t fits into the style, in fact I don't think that it does at all, but there you go.

Nose has light alcohol, light pepper and some spice.
Well, I guess that this is pretty true to style. Plenty of hop bitterness against the background of seriously peppery sweetness. Bitterness lingers and the finish is VERY dry. 
Some slick, syrupy, viscous mouthfeel which I guess is fine, but to be honest the beer would be fine without. This could easily go down a couple of percentage points and it would still work and drink nicely.

Surprisingly sweet nose but there is more of the standard biscuit malts and crisp bitterness in the body of the beer than the aroma would suggest. Light, unsweetened grapefruit along with some citrus orange character.
Aftertaste seems particularly strong with a metallic bitterness and some surprising hop presence.
Interesting beer that steps slightly outside of the ESB category for me in terms of the bitterness. Slightly drier than usual and malts seemed less prominent and less rounded. A little harsh for the style perhaps?

Outside of the appearance I get a whole load of things that seem more familiar to me.
Light, biscuit malts and fruit in the nose which are replicated in the taste. It drinks simply and easily and the ABV is a treat. Unfortunately my extensive cask experience in the UK means that I am constantly disappointed but bottle versions of this type of brew. It's NOT he same as drinking this on cask in Oxford!

22 oz, screen printed bottle.
Poured into the Duvel tulip, this beer has an appearance that leans more toward the wood than the cherry side of things. Dark and very rich garnet color, perhaps closer to brown, with a head that is only provoked by aggressive swirling. Having done that, the head is quite creamy but still short-lived. Minimal lace but I wasn't expecting much.
Nose gives up some malt and a touch of tartness but not much else. As it warms, fruit cuts in a little more.
I'd agree with many of the other reviewers here that there is a sweet/sour note with the emphasis on sweet first followed by sour. The dry character of authentic cherries also comes through quite strong. A touch of wood, but it is muted. Finishes with light dry notes but it is NOT aggressive or pronounced.
I like this beer since the wood is reserved and the cherries give a decent amount of sweetness, color and fruitiness without the beer ever getting ""sweet"" as such. A fine balance is struck across the board, and New Belgium has produced a beer with a very light touch BUT with serious note associated with it. VERY pleased with this beer since it straddles a couple of difficult taste/style combos very well. Not an easy beer to pull off but this does it."

Pour is a clear, golden hue with a decent head and some lace. Carbonation levels are appropriate and good.
The beer basically looks like, acts like and feels like a simple, well put together lager. There are simple crisp notes that make it very drinkable, and a hint of fruit in amongst the malt and hop balance. Drinks VERY easily and is tailor made for summer drinking in the south. It doesn't fel or drink much like a traditional Wit at all, so if you're looking for that, search elsewhere.
Obviously a lot of crossover potenial and plenty of potential for pairing with simple, grilled fare and other light food.
Very little to report here. This is a relatively well made beer that will appeal to the masses in the warmer months. It's not a beer that many geeks will either have much time for, or perhaps even give much credit to, but if you take it for what it is (and no more), you'll appreciate the beer for its own (limited) attributes.

Reading the bottle and knowing what I know about English beer, I am immediately suspicious of this brew for a least one reason. The name worries me since I'm expecting that this one of the relatively new (last 5 years) breed of British ""Golden Ales"" that have popped up. As far as I can tell, the new ""Golden Ale"" in the UK is basically a dumbed down English Pale/Bitter that is designed to appeal to the masses. My experiece with them has been very mixed, so putting this in a bottle as opposed to a cask has me even more worried.
The pour is a clouded tangerine with some soapy head but minimal lace.
The nose has a touch of hops, but it is muted. Some light fruit too - citrus based but not especially specific, perhaps some mixed peel?
Very nice sweetened grapefruit tastes. It's definitely grapefruit based and get increasingly bitter with warmth. Very refreshing and a decent hop bite at the end.

Pour was a standard dark, chestnut color but the head and lace are both WOREFULLY disappointing. This is at least in part to the pathetic way the beer was poured, but also a sign of things to come with the brew.
In a nutshell what we have here is a flimsy Dopplebock. Watery in terms of its body, presence and taste, a Dopplebock for the masses perhaps? It lacks any chewy, large malt character and watery (at least for the style) is what continually comes to mind.

HUGE, HUGE bubble-gum nose. Not sure if I like it, because the alcohol that's in there starts to take on a very astringent, solvent like note against the background of the gum.
Viscous body (as expected) and the bubble gum and pear drop notes come through. It's alcohol soaked (again as expected) but it doesn't seem to meld all that well.
I dunno, I was really looking forward to this, but it's just too hot and more importantly, solvent like. It burns a little.

Massive alcohol and esters are there all the way through. The classic Belgian yeasts are supremely evident and I feel that this is simply a standard for the style. Lots of pear, pineapple and other fruits this is a dangerous combination of alcohol and drikability.

Wit's are an intriguing style for me because a really well made one is a beer that I enjoy, but at the same time I feel that they have the potential to be a bit of a let down. Their success largely hinges upon their mouthfeel for me, and the biggest crime that one can encounter is a Wit which is watery and lacking in body. Unfortunately this was one of those.
The pour led to the standard appearance but it lacked much life. This is another problem when dealing with Wit's because this has the potential to make the beer look uninspiring at best and like dirty dishwater at worst. Standard, clouded yellow color but the head and lace were both disappoining.
The mouthfeel is where this one really fails - simply put it lacks any depth. That is where the beer falls down and never recovers. Bland and lacks any citrus intensiy and presence.
Mild spice notes are present, as are some Belgian yeasts, but the whole thing is so flimsy and fragile in its construction it never takes off for me. Feesl limp in terms of the intensity and the clove and other spice elements just don't come together at all.

Nose has light funk and some diluted vinegar.
The tastes are rather dry with a LOT of wood in there too. It's has some leathery notes but the wood is VERY strong. A little salty in the finish. Way too woody and ill-defined funk at the moment.
My guess is that this beer is just really young. It feels immature and the acidic notes are nowhere near where they need to be yet.

After all the hype surrounding this beer, and all of the trouble that people have gone to in order to get it, I found it a little perplexing/strange/amusing that it should be sitting there and being liberally served in pints for $3.75!
Anyway, it pours the standard black color with a fast receding head and some (but not a great deal) of lace. Nose is definitely the strongest attribute of SC for me. Wave after wave of deep, rich, milk chocolate notes with touches of additional burned after tastes too. Creamy chocolate followed by alcohol and roasty burn.
The alcohol catches up with you quickly here, and it diminishes the drinkability. It's a beer that is not really easy to consume, and I suppose that it's not supposed to be, but I found it a little harsh on the back end.

Very difficult to categorize this, nor am I sure what Pisgah is trying to do here, but here we go.
This is described as a ""Pub Ale"" but I have no idea what that really means. My suspicion is that they have drawn inspiration from the nasty, cream-flow, pseudo English bitters that we get in cans in the US. Seems like an unlikely source of inspiration for Pisgah, but hey, whatever.
The beer is presented on nitro pour with a Hefe-like, clouded yellow body and a thick creamy head. It is definitely reminiscent of one of those beers like Boddingtons, John Smith's or Tetley's in the (smoothflow) can. The real difference here is that there is a VERY strong organic, grassy, earthy note. It's extremely strong and this is the feature that takes it away from those other beers and puts it into its own realm. This is what puts the Pisgah stamp on it.

Nose and tastes seem excessively malty for the style. When I pick up a Red Ale of any description, I'm looking for a really dry finish rather than a sweet malty one. Strangely the malt based beers are my favorite one so I actually enjoy drinking this, but the beer seems malted out of style. Therre's a little musty, old feel to the beer too which I don't think is a function of its age, more a function of its character.
Strange beast this since I am disappointed by the lack of dry elements, very UNsurprised by the appearance and lack of head retention etc, but I still managed to find it drinkable and enjoyable."

Light citrus note in the nose that is not really aggressive. In fact, quite sweet, tangerine like smells collect in the bowl of the glass.
Pretty astringent hops in the taste and it finishes dry. There is not much to report here since it is largely in line withe style and the hops that are present. Metallic bitterness lingers in the finish a little too long for my liking.

Pour is a slightly clouded, deep orange in typical American IPA style. Head is small and white but has some fine lace.
Nose has the requisite soapy and citrus notes, but is is restrained.
Tastes follow the nose pretty faithfully. Very light citrus and hops gently kiss the palate, but you know that they are much deeper and aggressive than they are prepared to give away at first. A bit like a dirty girl on a first date! To carry on the theme, this is a gentle, almost feminine American IPA with a LOT of character of the more reserved, original, English style. I would not call this aggressive but any stretch of the imagination, and the beer benefits from that reserved nature. Citrus like in the finish with the emphasis on tangerines rather than grapefruit or more harsh tastes.
VERY easy drinking since the alcohol is ridiculously well hidden and the tastes are subtle rather than smashing one in the face. Lovely, simple brew that on cask would have the potential to blow my mind. Tasty."

Jet black pour that is not necessarily as viscous as I was expecting. Actually quite carbonated too. The head is a typical mocha, coffee one with some good retention and lace.
Nose and tastes are pretty typical with burned malts, molasses and astringent coffee. Not much to report here other than the obvious. The finish accentuates all of the usual stuff; alcohol, bitterness and dark chocolate notes as well as the coffee.
Frankly this is what it is and very little else. If you want a big coffee stout then you will be delighted. If you don't, then you'd better not go anywhere near this beer!
There really isn't much to report here other than what you would expect, and you had better be looking for some serious coffee bitterness too.

Golden orange pour with some nice snowy white, fluffy head. A few yeast floaties come with the first pour.
Nose offers a touch of mustiness, but a larger dose of mild orange, lemon and grapefruit citrus. The taste reflects the accentuates the citrus rather than the funk, bu it is clean, mild and does not linger. Frankly a surprisingly subtle, low-key beer in terms of the taste. This may disappoint some, but to me it adds to the drinkability and I am delighted to enjoy what adds up to be a really quite subtle beer. The brew is certainly grapefruit based but its really quite light. Finishes quite dry, alcohol is very well hidden and from the taste alone you'd be forgiven if you thought this could be sessionable.
Summer and spring drinking is called for here but the beer is difficult to put down under any circumstances. There is a fine, dense carbonation that leads to a really velvety mouthfeel that also adds to the drinkability. put it al together and this is a very, very nice beer."

The beer drinks much milder than the aroma would have you think. Pretty well balanced for an American IPA and drinkable with a solid backbone.
I must admit that although this is a solid beer, quite how it can hope to win a serious part of the massively over-saturated, American IPA market is beyond me. It's the kind of thing that you need to drink close to the source as freshness is likely to be one of the beers' only selling points.

Pour is jet black and viscous. The head is non-descript, but it does leave some espresso colored lace.
Nose is as expected with a fairly large dose of the requisite molasses, charred notes, malts and alcohol.
The taste is where things get interesting. Simple, ultra-sweet alcohol up front as expected, but the beer is defined by the finish and the aftertaste. I like the sweet, sherry like notes initially, but smoke cuts in quickly. This in turn is almost completely overwhelmed by the creosote and tar ending and aftertaste. It LITERALLY feels like you are drinking liquid asphalt. This is NOT a beer that could be called anything but massive and frankly it does not come together well. Of course, I'm not all that surprised by the package as a whole, but the feeling and taste of a freshly paved road was a little off-putting. In terms of an ""American"" version of the style (albeit from Denmark), it's pretty surprising in as much as there is very little hop character hanging around.
Not sure if this really qualifies as beer as we know it, and to be honest the brew fails in the important areas of taste and drinkability. I'm not against these experiments per-se, but too often they should not be inflicted on the consumer.

Nose delivers a light, earthy hop note but not much else.
There is a decent dose of diacetyl in the taste which is a little unfortunate. It doesn't spoil the beer completely for me, but it does influence what I can taste quite significantly. Floral and light hops which seems quite grassy, organic and fresh. Clean, perhaps a little too clinical. Dose of soap in there too which I enjoy.

Body is a very golden, yellow color with the emphasis on yellow as opposed to gold. Lace is broken, extensive but wispy has opposed to sticky.
Nose has the requisite funk, but it also has an alcoholic edge almost like an imperial Hefe.
The nose strays into the mouth too. A really quite alcoholic feel to the beer and it drinks every inch of its 7.40 %. The alcohol seems really prominent and it reminds me a LOT of DFH Golden Shower/Era, or perhaps even the original 22 oz Sam Adams Imperial Pilsner. Hoppy bitterness permeates the finish and the aftertaste. Pretty dry too, with a mild burn in the back end.

It's not until we get to the taste that things start going slightly awry. There's a lot of sweetness but it comes with a rather large amout of earthy funk.

Pour produces a very nice, mid-brown color with plenty of carbonation. The head is very nice and the retention is first-class. Lace is some of the best I have seen recently. Bubbles rising constantly.
Despite the apparently high carbonation, the beer still has a decent mouthfeel and is not at all prickly.
Strange beer in terms of the taste. It has many of the malty, layered sweet character that one would expect, but also there is a tangy bitterness in the back end and the finish. Under no circumstances would I describe this as a hoppy beer, BUT the ending is definitely more bitter than the style would normally allow. This would usually put me on my guard (ANOTHER over-hopped American version of a classicly malty style), BUT this seems to meld better than most. The bitterness sees to add an almost wine like quality and the beer takes on a character that is (nowhere near as good, but...) reminiscent of one of the Allagash Victor/Victoria beers.

Pour is a golden orange with very little head, no head and very little lace. The second pour (that includes some sediment) removes the clarity and adds a better head and more orange rather than golden character.
LOTS of residual sugars in the taste, and it does have a distinct Belgian candy note about it. We get a fairly hefty smack of hops early, but this does not linger. A little orange peel or marmalade note in the finish. Bitterness lingers too.
Mouthfeel is light and the beer feels really clean. Some heat with the alcohol but not a great deal

Body is a cloudy orange that is a tad too pale for my liking. 
Nose is a little light grass but has some sweetness in there too.
Nice upfront mild bitterness and a solid malt presence to hold the whole thing together. Some nice biscuit malts too.
It feels a touch over-carbonated to me, but perhaps it is unfair to compare this to a cask ESB from the UK, but nevertheless a bit prickly in the mouth. Finishes with a touch of residual sugar which is OK with me.
Easy drinking, but cans (or bottles for that matter) don't show off the style to the greatest degree. I'd like to try this on cask but essentially there is zero chance of that.
Drinks well considering everything and is (on the face of it) sessionable, but without knowledge of the ABV, who knows?

Malts are refreshing with a tiny hop bite in the back end of brew and in the aftertaste. Extremely refreshing and for that reason I found the drinkability very high. Almost lemony or citrus in parts like sweetened grapefruit. NOT grapefruit in a classic IPA, hop type way, more of a ""flavor"". Simple beer, but tasty and moreish. Sessionable quality but I would like the ABV to be a least 0.5 units lower.

VERY complicated beer for me to review. I'm really not at all sure where I stand on this one but here goes...
Opening the bottle causes a pretty big pop and significant gun smoke. This is generally a good sign, although a little surprising for a double IPA (despite the bottle conditioning). Pour is dark orange, well carbonated affair with great lace and decent retention. The color is rich and it looks good.
Nose seems well versed in the pine and typical west coast notes that one might expect from the style, but then it also has a slightly solvent alcohol presence too - less attractive and it concerns me a touch.
The tastes really reflect what we found in the nose. Some very obviously heavy-handed hops (I was expecting that and it's in line with e style), but also some significant alcohol presence. It burns a little, and the back end and aftertaste are not subtle at all. Puckering dry hops that are not quite as they should be - much too green and harsh, EVEN considering the style carefully. Despite this flaw the beer still retains a ""moreish"" quality, and the whole thin is a bit of a paradox. Strange stuff.
GREAT hoppy burps BTW which for me is a signature of a good DIPA.
The mouthfeel is good, but seems a little too carbonated for the style.
I really feel conflicted by this. On one hand this beer hits some style home runs nicely, but at the same time seems to have elements that are inconsistent. Another difficult thing for me to fathom properly is the drinkability. In one way I would put this right up there in the good category, but the odd, astringent aftertaste puts me off somewhat. I dunno, one of the most confusing and paradoxical beers in recent times.
Good stuff, makes me reflect upon my palate and experience; thanks Daniel!"

Carbonation is quite high (as I was expecting), but the acidity is really very significant.

Nose has a CLASSIC, German breadiness to it. There is just NO way that you could mistake this for anything other than what it is.
To me, NOT that different from the Mai Bock in terms of quality and authenticity.

750 mL, gold-foiled and capped champagne style bottle.
I was concerned about he drinkability of this beer before I opened it. I am generally pretty wary of the American Porter style since the American version of the style usually takes away the creamy malt goodness of the traditional, English style Porter and replaces it with far too many hops. Also, 10% ABV is just really, really, really tiring for me - over and over again this goes too far. In short, I usually feel that ""Imperializing"" a porter is just silly. The abiding memory of this beer will be how it broke the mold.
Pour is a pretty standard look with an apparently jet black body which reveals some dark brown on exposure to some serious light. Head is initial good, but fades quickly in line with the ABV.
Definitely creamier, less hoppy and smoother than I was anticipating. Drinks ""English"" rather than ""American"", and in that respect I was delighted. Some simple chocolate and mildly burned notes in the nose and taste, with a light burn in the finish that is a LONG way from where I expected it to be. Cocoa and light, English Drinking Chocolate and patent malts finish the beer.
Drinkability is MASSIVE, and if you take the ABV and the style into account, then it's off the charts.
Having not had this fresh I cannot say for sure, but I bet this has benefited MASSIVELY from aging - my strong suspicion is that young I was would not have enjoyed this half as much."

Nose produces the nice alcohol and marzipan bread notes that one would expect. So far, so good, and then...
..the tastes simply do NOT deliver in the way they should. Frankly we get an alcoholic, peppery, metallic, licorice, bitter mess. The coinage feel is VERY prevalent and the malt (while present) is totally overwhelmed by a burning, bitter metal taste. The metallic nature lingers too. The taste may be down to too great a hop presence in a style that doesn't require it. Either way it sits badly.
Mouthfeel is just about right for the style, with a rich, slightly creamy feel to it.
On the crucial aspects of taste and drinkability, this beer fails quite badly. On the arguably less important attributes of appearance, smell and mouthfeel it does very well. It's a paradox, but ultimately the tastes let this beer down badly.

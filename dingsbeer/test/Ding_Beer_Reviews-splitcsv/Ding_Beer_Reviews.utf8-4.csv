Pour has a lot more orange color (with some cloudiness) than one would expect. Very low carbonation and floral hops, this has the feel of a cask ale. Delicious.
Aftertaste has a little bitterness, but of course it is muted. Plenty of biscuit malts. The light floral notes are the overwhelming experience, and they are super tasty. Organic notes, with some grassy taste too.
Very light; very organic; very floral.
An unusual ale in as much as it reminds me of a cask. Tasty and very drinkable. Certainly won't be to everyones taste, but for me it is super."

Like its lighter brother, this bottle has a higher expectation than the actual beer ultimately delivers.
To be fair the body and look is decent enough with good clarity and a decent head (a little lace) - nose delivers some half-decent malts too and it drinks easily, but it's light on taste and depth.
OK for a summer beer, but lacks any kind character."

Standard dark brown pour with a small, nicely formed head but not much (if any) lace. Solid if unspectacular look. Some red highlights.
Very standard and solid example of the style. More bitter than the English original, less creamy with a higher hop profile, but simply solid. Mild raost.
A simple, unspectacular brew without much charm but a decent example."

Impressive 750 mL bottle, thick and heavy glass and thick gold foil on the neck. Nice presentation. Bottle lacks the champagne dimpled bottom. No vintage noted on the bottle, but must be fresh (Late '07/Early '08). No cork, no cage, just capped.
Poured into te Ommegang chalice the head is small and lacks much depth, and the body is a light, brownish/red. Little lace. When the light hits the glass in a certain manner it looks REALLY red - literally!
Nose is mainly brown sugar with a touch of alcohol and a touch of Belgian yeast. 
Sweet, mild alcoholic raisins and plums are the main competing tastes. Rich malts follow in the finish and aftertaste with a touch of subtle alcohol. Has a certain maderia sherry quality about it. Obviously the taste improves with a touch of warmth.
Very nice offering in most respects with the only fault in my book being the mouthfeel. I thought it was a tad thin for the style."

Run-of-the-mill American IPA with a hop base that is consistent with the style, slightly unbalanced and mildly puckering. Malt is there but battered by the hops. The head is small and poorly retained. Decent color, more on the brown side rather than the oft orange side of things.
Nose is fairly aggressive with a citrus ine combo.
At the end of the day an OK American IPA, but it's somewhat lost in shuffle. It is possible that my tastebuds may be a bit jaded in this style, but for me this does not make much of an impression."

Amazingly dense, perfectly white head with excellent retention and lace. Golden (and I mean golden), hazed body. 
Creamy smooth in the mouth. A combination of cream and velvet.
Nose is frankly NOT much! A little disappointing.
Classic peppery, mild bitterness in the taste with an alcohol edge way beyond the advertised ABV. Drying finish and VERY clean. Champagne-like character for me.
As Jason noted, this may be the very best session beer in the world. Obviously slightly too high in ABV for a TRUE sessionable beer, BUT it's only slightly above what I would tolerate, and for an experienced drinker in the right frame of mind this could be THE perfect beer for a long night of drinking. In the USA, the availability and price obviously negate that!
In summary, a deliciously drinkable brew IF you can appreciate the subtleties of this beer. I think this one is really for the experienced drinker."

Pour has excellent color, with a beautiful red clarity and a nice creamy head. Good lace. Looks inviting.
Malty nose, but some extra hop character. It melds quite nicely together. A little sugary-sweet alcohol in there too.
Nice malty base which encourages me, but ultimately the hop bitterness slightly spoils the finish for me. I think this is yet ANOTHER American brewed ESB that has too prominent a hop taste. Bitterness lingers a LONG time in the finish.
The beer is OK, but once again I am disappointed in the style reference."

Taco Mac is advertising this as ""La Russe"", which for now, I am assuming is this beer - seems reasonable, but maybe I'll have to change it later. As usual, TM has a tenous connection with beer knowledge. Served way too cold.
Pint has a nice garnet color, but a small head and not much lace. Has a typical, British, kegged-bitter appearance, which to be brutally frank, is not necessary wonderful.
In reality, I quite liked this beer - it seemed to have an almost sweet and sour quality about it. It was difficult to characterize this, but I am guessing that the malts made uo the sweetness and the hops introduced some bitterness. Certainly a fruity nature to the beer as well. Slightly tart fruit in there (unsweetened raspberries, strawberries ""x""berries etc.)
This was tasty. I'm not totally convinced by it, but I would like to visit it again."

Here's the deal - by all means make a sessionable, simple, low ABV beer (the lack of these type of beer is what I am pretty much constantly lamenting here in the US), BUT that's not an excuse to brew a beer that is frankly thin and bland and lacking taste.
Very poor effort for me all the way around. The mouthfeel is VERY thin, and the taste lacks character - I wasn't expecting much depth, but there was very little taste.
Again, no problem with a sessionable beer (in fact quite the opposite), but this was a poor effort. It takes time to make strides in brewing beers like this to a high level, and this is going to be a job for Victory, and a work in progress."

Very light colored (even watery) pour with a light, fluffy head that disappears quickly. Not much lace.
It drinks like a very lightweight Pils. A simple bitterness that fails to really bite. Mouthfeel is simple but does not really evoke any memorable experiences. Lacklustre.
A little too simple, EVEN for the style I feel. When you are brewing/drinking these delicate styles you tend to walk a very fine line between a forgetable beer and a nice example of the style, and this one has a foot in both camps for me."

Surprisingly light, golden colored beer that reminded me of a (recently) popular English Golden Ale in terms of its appearance. Low carbonation (as expected) but more thin head and lace than I was expecting.
Nice biscuit malts are present as I would I expect, and these do linger nicely into the aftertaste. Tasty brew with a smooth, drinkable character and I enjoyed this cask offering. It's not very often that I get the chance to grab a pint of cask in Atlanta so this was a real treat. It may have skewed my review a little too, but nevertheless I still enjoyed it.
Two problems for me; It's hop profile is too high for a Bitter, and it was $10 a pint! Bad value, it ought to be CHEAPER than the other 15 bottles and 15 taps in the place."

Light copper colored body with a fairly large, but not very dense, creamy head. Some lace. Small bubbles persistently rising from the bottom of the Sweetwater Pils glass.
Surprisingly malty nose with a little hop presence.
Balanced IPA initially, but really shows its American side in the finish and aftertaste. Smooth and tempered up front, but then quite a metallic, grassy bitterness to finish. Lingers too.
Refreshing and sharp, but a little too harsh for my liking."

Like a few other BA's, at first glance I thought this was probably a Czech *Pils*, but after closer inspection that particular word is distinct by its absence from the label -this turns out to be a rather average Euro lager with all its average points.
Golden pour, the body looks good. Decent carbonation and associated head and lace. Mild skunk in the nose, but it drinks innocently enough. Average sweetness, a good ABV for having a few in the hot weather. malty presence and no hop bite to speak of. Saaz presence is certainly missing!
A decent warm eather drinker, but only a couple of notches aove BMC to be honest. Decent value and easy drinking, and as long as your expectations are not too high, you'll be OK."

Well carbonated pour with a big, creamy attractive head. Leaves some pretty good lace. Nice clarity on the brown/red body. Some organic, grassy notes of hops in the nose.
Caramel malt, simple drying finish make up a classic example of the style. Tasty and toasty. Very nice dry finish is apparent which is a great sign for the style. Sharp, satisfying bitterness. This is very tasty.

Simple copper body, nice clarity and a simple, bone-white head. Some lace. Carbonation is medium.
Very simple malts. Biscuit notes and some mild pepper. Slight spice, that almost seems like a corriander note. It's a malt based beer (obviously) but the malts are not large ones. Tempered. Light in the mouth that makes it drinkable, but seems a little thin for the style.
Very good character, with a nice bitter ending. ABV makes it sessionable - price probably doesn't. Good example of a British based ale, but lacks the malty depth of a typical Scottish brew. Tasty."

Nice looking, brownish-red body in keeping with the style. Head is large and smoke colored (yellowish tinge). Head is a bit light and airy so it disappears very quickly. Very little lace.
Aroma is DISTINCTLY NOT smoked, which I suppose is a bit of a disappointment (hence the low score for aroma).
Mouthfeel is a little thin for me.
Mild smoke is the overwhelming taste. Not much Doppelbock flavor, but at the same time the beer seems to taste like I would imagine a smoked Dopplebock would! In that respect I suppose it is ""good"".
Not really my cup of tea, but if you like smoked brews I think this would be an option."

Amber color that lacks depth. Some impressive head, but this leaves very little lace ultimately. It's more froth than anything else. Some alcohol in the nose, but I don't pick up much else. Some sugary sweetness too.
Strange metallic bitterness accompanies the expected Bock characteristics. The bitter twang lingers on through the finish. Mouthfeel lacks the creamy luxury that you might expect from the style, and it all feels a little aftershave like! Solvent like quality in the aftertaste too, a bit rough.
I've noticed a few new offerings in this range and I went for this as I thought it would be the safest bet; IF it is the best they can offer, then there's not much point in trying very much else - we'll see."

OK, I think that you need to be in the mood for this. Obviously this is a VERY high alcohol brew and with that comes some syrupy body and excessive (relative) sweetness. Having said that, all things considered it drinks OK, and it is tasty.
I am very surprised at the color because it is so golden orange. Not a great deal of head and not much retention (but I wasn't expecting much). Obviously with a Doppelbock I was expectig a darker brew. I was also expecting some banana notes, but this really turned out to be a sweet, Euro lager.
Considering the massive nature of this beer it pulls it off well. This is NOT a brew to be trifled with, not is it a beer that should be judged outside of the parameters that it sits in. Take it for what it is and you'll probably be happy."

Very interesting in terms of style. Categorized in the BA db as a BSDA, on the label and in the name as a ""Mild Stout"" (whatever THAT is), but IMO it seems to be very close to a Dubbel. I'm increasingly confused becasue I am not a big fan of Dubbels in general, but THIS I quite like.
STILL has that relatively unattractive (to me), dirty brown murky body. Thin film of mocha head on the surface. Little or no lace.
Definitely some light chocolate, stout like notes. Smooth and drinkable. A nice combo of mild alcohol, Dubbel sweetness and a touch of stout bitterness. Tasty."

Poured this bad boy into the Duvel tulip. Golden body with a decent head. The head was not huge, nor did it last a long time or produce much lace, but considering the ABV not that surprising. ABV means I still score it high for look. 
Aroma and taste match very well. Belgian yeast notes, candied sugar, alcohol and spice. A touch of citrus and a sweetness that is really quite high - luckily I love that. Alcohol is superbly balanced. It kicks in and does the job, but is VERY balanced considering the 11%. Very well made brew. Coriander is beautifully balanced and gives a sweet and sour effect to the brew.
A special beer. Hits a number of my sweet spots. It won't be for everyone, but for me this is close to perfect."

Essentially this pours like a RIS. Jet black body, small mocha head and some lace, but not much - in line with the ABV. Looks luxurious.
Yeast and malt dominate the nose.
Taste? ASTONISHING!!! Alcohol is nowhwere to be seen and it's as smooth as HELL! Wave after wave of sweet, malty, alcohol.
I have a feeling that DFH have defined a new style. This is an IMPERIAL brown ale. I am VERY, VERY wary of silly, American nonsense when it comes to ""imperializing"" all sorts of styles, but this is a MASTERPIECE.
Another AMAZING beer from Sam and the boys - they are on the cutting edge. I plan to lay some of this down - I think it could be a delicious developer!

Pour shows a great, jet black pour (as expected), but a rather too fizzy a head. Carbonation seems high for the style. Head dies quickly with almost no lace.
Aroma IS exceptional - pure coffee, no more, no less. 
Tastes do not reflect the huge aroma. I guess I was expecting a big gulp of coffee, but instead I got a rather reserved, porter, mildly roasted flavor. The mouthfeel is a little disappointing for the style. In fact, rather thin.
Has to be said, this was pretty uninspiring."

Beautiful, deep chestnut brown pour. Small head with a little lace. Color and clarity are great, and with a bit more head it would have got a perfect appearance score from me.
What I like about this beer is exactly what I thought I would like - its explicit simplicity. Easy drinking malts, a classic mouthfeel and a low key, high quality, subtle taste. Solid malt backbone.
If this were local to me I could see it as a staple in the DBF. Delicious."

Big frothy head sits atop the burned orange colored body. Carbonation is a little too lively for my liking - seems kind of fizzy. Musty yeast in the nose.
Fruits are all over the place on the initial taste, but these back off quickly to leave a dry and surprisingly balanced beer. Not much sweetness in fact. A mild white pepper bitterness sits against the Belgian candy and yeast, and the overall experience is quite tempered. Carbonation makes in a touch prickly. A slight champagne like dry character about this one.
Nice beer but a couple of things; it fails to really show an identity. Not quite fruity enough, not quite spicy enough, not quite enough alcohol flavor, and as a result it seems to get lost in the shuffle. I also prefer a lighter (Duvel like) pale yellow color in my Belgian Pale's. Not really a big deal, but nonetheless something that I would like to see.
Not bad, but considering the, ""I was not blown away"" factor, too pricey for me to be a regular in the Belgian rotation."

Standard, jet black body with the espreso foam colored head - the color of the head reminds me of the tobacco stained wallcoverings of really old, Snug bars from the 70's. Attractive color. Some lace, but not extensive.
Nose has the usual roasty bitter profile, but follows up with a touch of alcohol. Carbonation seems a little on the high side of the style.
Mellow drinking. The taste does not crash into the tastebds with the bitterness that the nose might lead one to expect. Solvent like alcohol in the finish makes this a bit edgy. Roasted charcoal flavor does not cut in until the aftertaste.
Not bad, but ultimately just another high alcohol, huge RIS for the sake of it."

Deep orange pour into the Ommegang chalice. No head or lace as expected. Pretty typical - high alcohol, sticky mouthfeel, sweet, bitter hop burn in the finish. Like most American style BW's, this is not subtle and is just a little too aggressive for me.

Pour is VERY good looking. GREAT clarity, super head and some lace but with a delicious looking, dark copper colored body - really nice presentation. More sticky lace would have scored it a 5. Frankly at this ABV it's a miracle that it has any at all.
Aroma threatens some sweetness with plenty of alcohol.
Despite the 10%, this drinks well under that number with a very nice mouthfeel - I was half expecting a nasty, syrupy mess. Alcohol is there in the taste but so is a lovely, balanced (as much as you can hope for in a 10% ABV DIPA) malt backbone. Obviously sweet and boozy, but this is one of the better attempts at such a big beer - I really enjoyed it.
Drinkability is a 5 for me, not because this is especially easy to quaff (no more than one 650 mL bottle needs to be consumed in a sitting, and sharing would be nice), but taking into account the style and the ABV I was delighted with the ease of putting it away.
Very nice stuff, tasty, high quality beer."

Nice looking pour with a slightly cloudy appearance, a nice head and a little lace.
Nice example of the stlye that strays over into Belgian Pale territory. Some yeasty notes as well as tastes that have some spice like a tripel. Only thing missing is the alcohol which is pretty much non-existant in this beer.
Finish is dry. Finish is also a little watery.
Decent for the style, but fairly pedestrian."

12oz single in the typical Boulevard stubbie bottle. Hazy orange body with a distinct honey/orange hue. Large initial head with some serious fizzy carbonation. No lace and the head is gone within a couple of minutes. Looks a bit lifeless in the glass. 
Very bland without much taste at ALL. Perhaps a slight, dilutd citrus angle. In fact, the word ""diluted"" seems to be appropriate to me. Watery mouthfeel.
Sorry, but not much to get me excited here. A limp and lacklustre beer that misses on all fronts. A wheat beer for me needs some life to sit against the (relatively) subtle tastes, and this one fails across the board.
A beer that I would imagine would be better fresher and n draft - perhaps I'll never know!"

Product of Belgium? An English Strong Ale? No Barley? I wonder...
Cloudy amber pour with a small amount of carbonation. Head is frothy and light but has a nice formation. Broken lace forms on the glass.
Aroma is dent with a touch of alcohol and some malty fruit.
Tastes a bit wine like. Alcohol seems MUCH higher than the 6% would suggest. The more I taste, the more cider/wine tastes come through. Slightly acidic and rather refreshing actually. Some fruit in the finish. Chilled well, this is reminiscent of a simple fruit beer. Not sure I can identify the specific tastes, but it is drinkable. Has a pleasing dry finish too that kicks in a little extra bitterness.
I guess that I really didn't know what to expect at all, but to be honest this really wasn't bad. I know that some people don't even consider this to be beer, but I think it is half decent. To be quite frank, I think I could drink a few of these!

Pours with a really rather alarming amount of carbonation - very fizzy. Obviously this dies very quickly to settle into the non-carbonated, still beer that I was expecting, but I was shocked by the initial pour. Strange. Settles to give a dark orange (verging on red) body with some spotty lace only on the surface.
Aroma is not complicated and seems to be made up of an earthy alcohol and not much else.
Tastes are mixed. As expected there is an enormous sweetness and some warming alcohol in the finish, but the effect that the whisky has had is a little odd. It seems to have imparted a smoked, earthy, peat like taste to the beer which seems a bit disjointed. 
Probably my least favorite of the Lees Harvest Cask series."

Odd, wit colored pour but exhibits some clarity. Not much carbonation but it does create a decent head in the 20oz Imperial pint glass.
Macro lager attributes all over the place with the exception being a sharpish, hop bite in the finish. No aroma and a strange, malty bitterness associated with each mouthful

Pour is very pale, even anticipating the style. Nice looking head initially, but of course it fades in seconds to virtually nothing and there is no lace.
Aroma yields a little cooked vegetables but not much else.
Clean until the finish which comes through with a little hop bitterness - almost like a badly made Saaz pils. Aftertaste has a metallic bitterness that lingers. To its advantage it feels clean upfront.

Very attractive golden, orange hue that had good clarity, nice carbonation and a decent white head and some good lace. A close look at the body seems to reveal a little oily, viscous nature - more of that later.
Taste is relatively crisp and refreshing, but ends with a surprisingly large alcohol taste. Not sure if it was actually the alcohol, or whether it was just a ""taste"" of alcohol. The mouthfeel is a bit viscous, and together these factors seems to make this drink above it's published ABV. The aftertaste is also a bit of an odd, yeasty, malty mess that ligers a bit.

Soapy element to the nose. Mild caramel backbone with some grassy, organic like hops also detectable. A little bitterness in the finish, but not a great deal. Smooth in the mouth, possibly the best feature of this beer. Some lingering bitterness in the aftertaste. A bit powdery, not especially clean in the taste - maybe an older bottle.

Usually the nose and the taste match fairly well on Weizenbock's (one of my favorite styles), but this one has banana, (slight) clove and sweetness in the taste but more emphasis on the alcohol in the nose.
Sweetness is a little too much EVEN for my tastes, and I think it pushes this slightly to the edge of the style. Apart from that it has all the characteristics of a good Weizenbock but I think it needs some refinement. Nearly there."

Very mild funk in the nose with some alcohol. As it warms more funk comes on.
Very mild tatrness, very mild alcohol and a slight hop bite add to the taste sensation. Slightly oily, slick mouthfeel with a little pils like, Saaz hop bite toward the end. In ALL respects this reminds me of a diluted Imperial Pils (Sam Adams or a DFH Golden Era/Golden Shower). Don't get me wrong, it's a lot lighter than those beers, but it is a very interesting. Very, very mild white pepper.
The mouthfeel IS a bit unusual for the stlye, but for me it works! Slightly slick, slightly Pils like, slightly delicious!
I like this a LOT - all kinds of interesting angles on a Saison which treads a fine along along the edge of the style, but it works VERY well. Very tasty and subtle too. I think this could be a really nice crossover beer. ABV compliments the whole package.

This beer drips alcohol and lives all the way up to its 9.5% tag. Surprisingly still quite fruity and plenty of Belgian candy sugar, but mild burning alcohol on the tongue and in the throat and chest are the enduring memories.

Interesting because I think this seems to straddle the Enlish/American styles of BW. A sticky, syrup like consistency but the sweetness holds off until the aftertaste for me. However, if you spill this you'll see how sugar there is in this brew! A bit more hop bitterness than I was expecting. Alcohol, while certainly present is not near the 11.00%

I like the packaging - fresh, green look to the label, immediately distinguishable as a Blue Moon/Coors product. Label gives it an extra 0.5 points on the ""appearance"" score.
Typical macro pour, with slightly better lace and head than expected. Still very macro looking with the golden yellow body, great clarity and lively carbonation.
Largely devoid of aroma and taste. Has a slightly citrus note, which to me is more grapefruit than lime like, but to be honest when it is this close to water it hardly matters.
On the plus side quite crisp and refreshing, but strictly from a ""good on a very hot day"" angle.
I dunno - a missed opportunity that could be better but ultimately disappoints. Another token gesture from the big boys, such as a shame they don't REALLY go fo it with TASTE!"

Original Review 02/08
===
12oz single, thanks to Mikesgroove for this little gift! 07/27/05 dot-matrixed on the rear label as the bottling date, Batch #? 0850, and the label claims the ""Flavor will continue to develop over five years"" - plenty of time then.
Big foamer. Poured into a regular wine glass, the carbonation remains huge on top of the cloudy, golden body.
Whatever has happen to this beer since it was bottled, it now appears to have turned into a funky Saison. Lots of peppery notes with tart lemon and cider (scrumpy) tang. Some aniseed type flavor. This is just about at the extremity of what I would call a Belgian Pale simply because of the funk.
Mouthfeel is a little light with a mildly acidic aftertaste. The funky taste grows on you.
Interesting beer that I would have liked to have tasted fresh, just for the comparison, but also to see if this was less funky at the outset.
Not really what I was expecting."

Poured into the Sam Adams glass the beer has great clarity and initially a light, frothy head. The head fades quickly to leave some scant lace. Very bright orange color makes this look pretty good in the glass.
Aroma is a solvent like alcohol as are the initial tastes. Some fruity character, but not distinguishable as grape to me. I'm not sure if that's the grape element, but whatever it is it creates an odd, solvent alcohol taste. The beer is not overtly alcoholic, but it seems to have an odd, drying, fume type character. Weird. No grape taste as such for me. 
It's odd, but the grape element seems to create an alcohol taste (wine like I suppose).
Refreshing and quite tasty, it's OK, but I don't think I would bother again. A bit odd."

12 oz single. Pour is a fairly typical, mid-orange affair with a surprisingly good head and lace for the (apparently) large ABV (more of that later). Typically cloudy appearance for the style.
Nose conjures up a west coast assault on the taste buds, and we're not disappointed when it comes to the taste. The hops ARE massive, but somehow it seems less aggressive than many, similar west coast beasts. It's not like the malts shine through to help much, but perhaps Bell's have a secret ""balancing"" ingredient that they add. The alcohol is nowhere to be seen, I would have NEVER put this at 9.3%!
Interesting beer from two angles for me - firstly the apparent balance that is achieved, and secondly the hidden alcohol. Also, although the balance is there, it still manages to wreck the taste buds for beers later.
Tasty and enigmatic."

Poured into the 20oz pint glass. Plenty of large ivory, bubbly head, but not a huge amount of lace. Very nice reddish brown hue.
Very malty nose with some alcohol; very nice, reminiscent of the best, alcohol ridden doppelbocks.
The initial tastes are quite sweet and with some alcohol taste, but no burn. Very smooth and the fine carbonation gives a silkiness to the mouthfeel. A little rye comes through, but not much. Alcohol continues to threaten, but it's funny - it's a ""taste"" rather than a presence - good stuff.
In summary, a pretty interesting balance of rye character and doppelbock character. An interesting combo that I thought might be difficult to pull off by it worked quite well. Tasty."

Pour is essentially black with a nice mocha head. Has a RIS appearance, but the head is not well retained. Rich looking body.
Aroma is certainly attractive, with a mild bourbon type smell that again offers a rich character.
Taste is largely a smooth, light whisky from the oak but frankly not much else. I'm not a massive fan of oak, but it IS tasty as long as it is in small doses. I had about 8oz of the this beer and I wouldn't want to drink much more in any one sitting. The alcohol was pretty much well hidden, and the hit for me was the mouthfeel - just about as rich as a beer can be with out being a stout. Plenty of silkiness in the mouth, and very smooth.
The problem with oaked beers is that the taste can be overwhelmed by the oak and this, whilst still under control, offered little fo r me outside of the liquor presence. Not really reminiscent of a strong ale, if you like oak you'll probably LOVE this big, smooth beer. For me it's strictly a one-off tasting."

Tastes are very typical for the style, and to be honest I thought it hit all the spots pretty well. The only problem we had was that this was a year old bottle. The effect of the aging seemed to see it taper-off quite badly in the finish, leading to a watery ending with no presence. There were some signs of oxidation too.

Nice, mild orange peel nose with some mild sinus clearing hops.
Medicinal like bitterness meets the tongue at first, and then slips into that aspirin aftertaste. Letting it linger in the mouth produces more bitterness. Dry ending with some metallic character and some unsweetened grapefruit.
Quite a bitter brew, in fact one of the bitterest I have had in sometime, with a good dose of malts that sustain it, but are missing in action in terms of taste.

Mill-pond still on the pour. Dark orange body with a thin ring of lace around the edge of the glass.
Exceptionally sweet (there's no denying that) but it's in line with the style and fits perfectly with the calvados character. Having said that, the apple presence is VERY slight, and it really only imparts a slight tartness to the beer. Without knowing there was calvados present I would have never guessed it. In fact, the acidity is almost like a tannic, bittering grape skin effect.
Warming alcohol in the finish, but absolutely perfectly balanced. The finish also reveals a little more of the fruit, but its still pretty light.

This has traveled better than many others of the style, and I feel that this is a good example for Americans to sample a simple, moreish, English Bitter. Better on cask (what isn't?), but for now this will do the job.
It may be that I am being a little too enthusiastic about Bombardier, just because it is so difficult to get this type of brew on a regular basis in the US. I miss it terribly and perhaps I am looking through rose-tinted spectacles a bit, but I think this is a lovely brew.

Not the first time I've drunk this beer, but the overwhelming sensation is still the same this time around in the bottle, as it has been in the past from the cask. A dark pour that is reminiscent of a porter malt base and a very complex beer.
Each mouthful seems different with a combination of stout bitterness, smoke, dark fruits, caramel malts and dry hoppy notes! There's a LOT going on, maybe even too much. Smooth and highly drinkable for me.

OK, I've been critical of Jolly Pumpkin in the past because of the constant Brett profile of ALL of their beers - I KNOW this is their ""thing"", but it has got very annoying to pick up something labelled as a stout or a Belgian, only to find the funk TOTALLY taking the beer out of style. This is a Saison, so I am HAPPY to have the funk/sourness. IMO there's no point in call something a Belgian Dark and then soaking it in funk.
Anyway, back to this brew. Amber pour that threatens clarity but doesn't quite get there. Decent head and some lace. Looks nice.
Aroma is EXACTLY as one would expect (acidic funk), and threatens the nose as soon as the cap is removed. It's strong.
Decent Saison, but the mouthfeel is a little thin for my liking, and the acididty in general is bigger than than in should be. Lacks the more subtle, musty notes for me. I prefer a more subtle, rounder Saison rather than this acid threat.
Lacks subtlety for me, but at least this is a beer that SHOULD have funk and acidity!"

Poured into the Tucher Weizen glass this has a decent head for a few seconds but then it fades badly. Lace is scant. Body has a classic, hazed lemon look, so that was OK.
Strange, peppery-citrus nose followed by a weak, watery body that lacks banana or clove notes. Spice is not really there either, just white pepper. Odd, marmalade citrus note to the taste as well. Definite orange peel detected.
I dunno, not a very good beer, but a potential option as an introduction to something other than BMC. As such, it might open a door for a few poeple and the can angle is, as usual, interesting.

Pour is a dark, dark brown (basically black) with some dark brown chestnut highlights. Head is dense and creamy, but a little disappointing in terms of its longevity. 
Advertised on the label as a Belgian Style Stout, I would say this is just about exactly what I would imagine a beer in that style to be like. It has the attributes of a Belgian Strong Dark - the usual dark fruits, alcohol notes, sweetness and lovely yeast character - but then the ending cuts in with a really strong licorice bitterness. It’s seldom that I get such a strong sense of flavor, but this is one of those beers that delivers such a thing. A little aniseed in there too.
Reminiscent of Unibroue's Chambly Noire.
Smooth and silky in the mouth, particularly on warming, with some fine carbonation, this is a very drinkable beer. Glad to have a sensible and manageable ABV too, rather than something in the 10-11% range.

Biscuit malts dominate with a nicely balanced finish. Some hops in the ending. This reminded me a lot of a simple English bitter, and if I could have removed the carbonation and made it warmer this could have been a nice clone of a simple ESB.

Bottle still in the circular rather than the oval style from Bullock's, Marietta, GA, USA. $1.19 for 500 mL on sale. Jubbly.
Pour remains resplendent with the head, lace and color exceptional.
Still full of malty goodness with mild spice and wave after wave of first class drinkability. As smooth as you like, what a GREAT beer.

Delighted to see this turn up in GA at Green's on Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA - means it went ON to, and then OFF of, my Wants List very quickly!
Even though I LOVE the old, oval bottles, this spherical, 500 mL, green glass, embossed version is also superb looking - always have loved the labels too, this is 10/10 for presentation, it's almost worth buying this JUST for the bottle! Let's see if what's inside matches.
Dark brown pour (a few red highlights) with a huge, mocha, bubbly, dense head. Lace is excellent and the retention is first class.
Creamy mouthfeel meets the tongue and mouth followed by some residual bitterness. Quite hoppy as opposed to spicy. Some metallic bitterness in the finish that completes the picture. Drinks like a classic English bitter, with a sturdy malt backbone holding it together. Once again, it bears saying that, for me, we are not talking spice, but we are talking bitter hops. It has some old-fashioned, Black Country/Midlands Mild character. AGAIN - no spice in terms of Winter Warmer.
Alcohol is nowhere to be seen with this beer, and although it is well above the traditional view of a sessionable beer, it drinks in that category.
Drinkability is amazing, this is a very high quality beer."

However, this beer changed just about more than any other I have tasted as it warmed. And I don't mean gradually over a 45 or 60 minute period, I mean dramatically within 5-10 minutes.

Nice sweet and bitter combo on the tongue with the hops winning in the finish. Standard mouthfeel with a little prickly carbonation. A slight metallic nature too. Drinks more like a sessionable ABV than the 6.5%.
Easy, everyday drinking, probably something that New Yorkers have in their fridge on a regular basis."

I am generally not a huge fan Bourbon based beers simply because I often find that the Bourbon taste has the tendency to overwhelm the brew. Because of that fear I was delighted at the general smoothness of this. Yes it certainly had the Bourbon traits in the nose and in the taste, but it was a taste that melded all the malts and alcohol perfectly together.
Warmth and softness in the mouth. Delighted that the brew was not too edgy.
Very silky and smooth, and very well balanced. One of the few Bourbon based beers that I have really enjoyed to the full."

Aroma is brown sugar and some strong bubblegum.
Very sweet, with alcohol fairly well hidden until the finish at which point it cuts in fairly strongly, but is still more subtley warming just a few seconds after the swallow. Plenty of fruits - pear, pineapple, other alcoholic, phenolic and solvent based esters.
Despite the alcohol, the mouthfeel doesn't suffer too much and manages to stay away from the syrupy gloop that sometimes can invade this type of brew.
A little better than average, but this is not a stunning Quad, nor is it one of Weyerbacher's best efforts."

Macro colored pour, but better than average carbonation, with a small, perfectly formed head and some minor lace. Surprising clarity for a ""wheat"" - filtered I guess??
Aroma is that of watered down raspberries with a somewhat synthetic feel. Not all that promising.
A dryish fruitiness meets the tastebuds at first, at this is not that bad. Initially this is a watery fruit flavor, but it fades to yield a sort of nasty, dry candy sweetness (like American Sweetarts). Taste, mouthfeel and drinkability are all about average for a beer of its kind. Keep your expectations in check and you'll be happy.
One for the ladies perhaps, this is not really my idea of a good beer, BUT having said that I don't mind this kind of thing from time to time just as a change of pace. Much better in the summer, at the beach, but something I can at least relate to for what it is, and what it is trying to be - don't expect too much and you'll probably be happy."

Second bottle from the Greensboro trip in Novemeber 2007. 
Looks and drinks more like a Dubbel than I remember from before. Sweet raisin notes still there in the nose which is perhaps the best aspect of this beer. The 22oz Terrapin snifter produces some nice, fine carbonation.

Original Review 12/07

Sampled Christmas Day 2007 - 750 mL, corked & caged, purchased at $10.99 from GSO Wine Warehouse in Greensboro, NC, USA in November - just before it got to GA.
Dark brown body with a creamy head. Dark fruits (raisins and figs) dominate the nose, but the taste is little less fruity than the nose would suggest.
Good balance in the yeast, Belgian candy notes and alcoholic sweetness, but something seems missing. Couldn't really put my finger on the missing ingredient but I though it maybe a little too under attenuated?
Still a nice Quad, but for me it fails to break into the elite."

Dark orange pour from the typically, colorful FFF artwork festooned and yellow-wax dipped bottle. Pretty cloudy with a viscous (as expected) body, with some bubbly head (after the aggressive pour), but (as expected) little or no lace.
Sweet and malty alcoholic nose. 
Very sweet initial tastes accompanied by a syrupy mouthfeel. Alcohol is apparent upfront too. Then the finish cuts in with the typical American Barleywine hops. Interesting brew because it starts as a more traditionally English BW with lots of sweetness and alcohol, but then finishes in a much more typically American fashion. 
Even though the alcohol wasn’t overwhelming, it did seem to take me a much longer period of time than normal to finish this (even considering the style). A bit of a sipper for me."

Very English style biscuit malts are complimented with a certain richness. Some bitterness in the hoppy(ish) finish. Lovely sweet, moreish and rich aftertaste for a lager. A little Brown Ale like.

Some tart funky yeast in the nose, but all fairly muted. Tastes reflect the nose. Yeasty tartness is the overwhelming sensation with a bitter finish. Some unsweetened grapefruit also present in the ending.

Poured into the Duvel tulip (seemed appropriate), the head is initially big, but slips away somewhat disappointingly but leaving some lace.
Very yeasty nose with an element of tart fruit. The yeast is replicated in the taste, but the tartness is not. Simple mouthfeel and a pretty average Belgian Pale all around. Some mild white pepper and a TINY bit of spice round out some alcohol in the finish and a little dry character.
To be brutally honest a very standard, good, simple but average Belgian Pale Ale. Nothing wrong with that, in fact it's one of my favorite styles, but I was expecting more from the ""Signature Edition"". Ultimately, although solid, this came up at best only a touch above average and at worst a little short of expectations. Better options out there IMO."

Mouthfeel and alcohol are quite reserved for the style, neither really coming on strong in body of the beer, but a little more alcohol in the finish. Coffee bitterness comes into its own as the mouthful goes down.

I would put this in the category of an everyday Belgian. My guess is that this beer will be HORRIBLY under-appreciated in the US becasue these subtle, low ABV, mild brews are not widely accepted here.

I was a little wary of this since I have grown not to like many bourbon aged/infused beers, and often I find the simple oak aged to be a little overpowering as well. This was one of the more subtle ones I have tried.
Mahogany brown pour with not much carbonation (ABV 11.8%), but nevertheless still some head and lace. Still looking pour. Nice sweet aroma of brown sugar and a little oakiness, but the biggest upfront taste to me was a mild, warming liquor.
Very drinkable considering the ABV, and although some alcohol was there in the taste it did not overwhelm things. A little viscous in the mouth but that was to be expected.
A little removed from a classic Quad, but an enjoyable one nonetheless. I was glad to share this because of the ABV and the richness of the brew. 22oz would be a lot to enjoy on ones own."

The label boasts the combination of spring water from the river Otter in Devon (a few miles from my birthpalce and home), English floor malts, their own yeast and whole cone hops from the West Coast of the USA. This leads to a very aromatic nose - grassy freshness.
Quite a dry bitterness which was NOT what I was expecting. There is definitely a USA/UK IPA crossbred beer here. Has some simple, subtle notes of mild hop character that you might expect from an English version, but also plenty of citrus puckering notes from the West Coast. Also an unusual dry element as well.

Carbonation seems a little low to me, which means the beer lacks a life. Not exactly flat, but it seems a tad tired.
Even at 5-6 months, this would benefit from some more age to mellow it out I feel, BUT I worry about what time may do to the carbonation. On one hand this needs to develop a bit, on the other it may get even more lacklustre in the carbonation department.

Poured into the Duvel tulip, this is basically a slightly darker Belgian Pale. Honey colored. Creamy, small head with some lace. Aroma has some yeast, but is dominated by an alcohol solvent smell. Quite strong, not exactly sinus clearing but nevertheless very noticeable.
Belgian yeast character, but two things come on strong. The Bourbon taste (that frankly I am not wild about) and the alcohol solvent. The alcohol is not quite as bad as the aroma would have you think, but it is still prevelant. It gets better toward the bottom of the 750, but I wonder if that is alcohol taking its toll! Obviously, plenty of candy sweetness (Tripel). Some light pear and pineapple, but these fruits are Bourbon soaked!
Mouthfeel is just about average for this kind of brew, but the drinkability is not that high for me. I would even consider this as an alternative to liquor - maybe as a quick nightcap at the end of a big night.

Tall and slim bottle, heavy brown glass with an elaborate tree motif embossed toward the bottom of the botlle. Very nice presentation.
Pours very much like a Brown Ale. Disappointing lack of head, retention and lace UNLESS the pour is aggressive. When the pour is more aggressive you get a much happier, creamy head. Nice clarity; very little carbonation.
A little chocolate in the nose which is not repeated in the taste. Simple, sweet malty nuttiness in the initial tastes. A tiny bitterness in the finish.
Very tasty, I could easy session a few of these, despite the higher ABV than you would usually think of. Tasty beer, a nice product."

WTF is this?? Has the color of a macro lager, tastes like a sweet version of the same thing, and in addition it lacks any appearance or characteristic of an Irish Red. Most importantly no dry finish. Soap like aroma without that soap turning into hop bitterness as it usually does.
I don't understand this at all. It's almost as if the wrong beer had been put into the (attractive) bottle. 
It pours with a decent head and some lace, and doesn't look bad, it just doesn't look like an Irish Red. If we are talking ""in style"" then this is getting horrible scores. The fact I CAN drink it, and it looks OK means I have to score this average. Odd.

Soft, soapy hops in the nose but this is very reserved. Taste shows somthing unusual - a simple, balanced and well made beer that is not trying to prove anything, rather it is content to be a simply made GOOD beer. Balanced grainy sweetness and noticeable mild, soapy bitterness in the finish.

Sugary sweetness is the feature here. Metallic hop presence also features in the finish. Syrupy sweet mouthfeel makes this quite slick. Considering the ABV of 11.7 %, this is relatively drinkable and the alcohol is well hidden.

I pop into Taco Mac in Douglasville, GA, USA for a quick beer on a Saturday afternoon, and they are giving out 16oz cans of this stuff for free - being a true BA, I felt I HAD to a least try it, so I did! (The bar staff told me there was a regular Bud version too but I suggested that it probably wouldn't matter - perhaps I'll never know!)
Pour is briefly fizzy and then settles to give a horrible, peach/orange colored liquid. Looks a little like one of those V8 Fruit Splash drinks. Aroma is tomato juice based initially, but then fades. The taste is similar in as much as it starts out tomato juice based, but then fades quickly to give a watery consistency with some fizz. A little spice (or is it just salt?). Perhaps a little spice or celery, but not much.
I could see drinking this on a Sunday morning in an attempt to get over a BIG Saturday night, but seeing as that happens to me about once every five years these days, basically I'm never gonna drink this again! Might serve a purpose for those at LEAST 10 years younger than me!
Interesting marketing since half of the can is in Spanish. I am guessing this is a big hit in the Hispanic community, which clearly is a HUGE, growing demographic in the USA in 2007.

Thin beyond thin. It's almost impossible to imagine a stout with less body and taste. As my Dad woluld have said, ""as weak as water"".

12oz single bottle, bottled (apparently WITH LOVE) on Aug 17 2007.
Dark, butterscotch colored pour with some good carbonation. Nice, pillow-like, dense head with some nice rings of lace. Yeast dregs fall out of the botle when fully inverted to leave a toffee like small, sticky mass on top of the huge head. Looks super!
Good funk in the nose with a touch of sweetened apple cider. Highly drinkable becasue of the smooth mouthfeel and the very, very light citrus notes in the taste. Mild tartness, plenty of hard winter fruits (quince, a little cooking apples) and some Belgian yeast character.
Very well put together, I paired this with some aged cheddar (at least what passes for aged cheddar in the USA!) and a few wheat based crackers. Worked incredibly well together, and excellent combo.

Certainly Belgian, Strong and Pale, but at the same time NOT typically Belgian Strong Pale! Less sugar sweetness, and a far more savory angle on this than expected. Mild white pepper, but not the level of some others in the style. Organic, almost Saison like feel comes through.

I don't think that this is very well described as an Old Ale at all. Lacks the true sweetness and heaviness required for that style. As such this might be better described as an ESB. This didn't take away my enjoyment, I just thought it was a little misplaced in terms of style.

500 mL, splendid looking clear glass bottle.
Quite why this is listed as an American IPA I'm not sure, but I know that subject can get people all excited (What was the original IPA? Where does the modern IPA sit? What about Burton? What about DIPA's? What about subtlety? etc. etc.) so I think I leave that alone here.
Pale orange pour, nice soapy head. Soapy notes in the nose and initial tastes. Apparently the hopping process uses the additional whack of Cascade in the later stages, and these come through a little strong for my liking, somewhat overwhelming the malt and the other (Goldings and Fuggles) hops. Maybe I've answered my own, initial question, and it's the use of Cascade that puts this into an American IPA category.
Bitterness lingers in the finish, and at nearly 6% this beer is a little less traditional than some, similar efforts. A little thin I feel, and this tends to lead to a little lack of satisfaction.
I dunno, not completely sold or sure about this beer, I think I need to come back to it a few times. Lucky me!"

Very delicate brew that is fairly consistent with the English Pale Ale style that it claims to be in. Plenty of citrus notes fill both the nose and the palate, along with some prickly carbonation - rather too much for my liking.
This is an exceptionally ""light"" beer, and IMO it suffers a little becasue of it. A tad watery, I think the lack of body is the main fault. Lots of sweetness (that I like) and a very clean feeling brew.

A big, wine-like grape taste up front. Persistent bitterness with some pepper, and a noticeable lack of candied Belgian sugar. Not sweet at all. Finishes yeasty, with some orange peel and some lemon notes; a little more pepper and some light-burn alcohol. Definitely from the savory side of the Belgian Pale family rather than the sweet. Dry finish too.
Lack of sweetness makes this a pleasant change of pace. Many Unibroue beers can be difficult to truly distinguish between, but this one stands out for me. Definitely one of their more distinguishable offerings."

More surprises becasue this pours as a Belgian Strong PALE, not a dark. Oh well, interesting times!
Corked & Caged 750 mL, very different to the BA db picture! More questions.
Pouring into the Duvel tulip leads to a very, very good looking beer. HUGE head, fantastic lace and deep, deep golden body. Some small, dark floaties at the bottom of the glass (yeast particles?)
Nose matches the taste. A LOT of sherry, maderia type tastes which are delicious. Finishes a little dry, but the alcohol comes through and supports the dry bitter finish well. Almost Champagne like. Maybe a little thin for the style, but this drinks superbly (even at this advanced age). A little dry spice in the finish too. If anything it seems a little HIGHER than 8%.

Surprised at the simplicity of this beer considering it is part of the 100 series. Not that that it is a bad thing; in fact it's refreshing, but I did not expect such a brew as part of this series of beers. 
Anyway - pours a light amber color with a decent head and some pretty good lace. Touch of alcohol in the nose, but also some sweet grains - simple.
Mouthfeel is a little viscous (slight syrup), again surprising considering the (relatively) low ABV. Good balance between the hop bitterness (mild) and the sugary malts. Easy drinking, the beer is a little devoid of character, as if it is neither big or small. Strange. It falls between a low, sessionable potential and something more substantial."

Mouthfeel is very, very light. Lots and lots of fruit in the initial tastes which eventually catches up to a hoppy finish, but nevertheless the large fruitiness is the key here. I like it a lot, but to classify this as a big, West Coast American IPA is not really an accurate description - a twist on that, then OK I would agree.

Poured into the Abbaye du Val-Dieu chalice. Big pop on the opening with the foam threatening to come out and some decent gunsmoke.
Unimpressive color - the horrid, Dubbel, murky brown mess (I really dislike that color/appearance). Nice, creamy head on the top of the beer with a little lace. Some floaties in the body of the brew. 
Carbonation is high, a little prickly and a little annoying. Good yeast and fruit notes in the nose. Typical for the style and good. A little alcohol too. Maybe some light apples as well.
Tastes are alcohol based with some dark fig and raisin like fruit notes, but is a bit overwhelmed by the bitter notes in the finish. In fact the hop profile and the alcohol are both too high for my liking (at least at this young age). Maybe the hop bitterness that I perceive is actually a spice based bitterness, but to be honest it still has an adverse effect on the beer. This needs to mellow out a little I think.
Having said all of that, this is still a tasty beer, and a classy one, but it is one of the weaker ones in the St. Bernardus stable. I guess laying a few down would be an interesting experiment. It seems a bit edgy (young)."

I wasn't sure what style to expect, other than what I already knew about He'Brew. I have been impressed by their other, malty, sweet big beers and this was no exception. The description as an American Brown Ale is a good one, but I think I might add the ""Imperial"" moniker too! In general I am not crazy about hyped up, American Brown Ales, but this is one of the few that hits the spot nicely.
Alcohol up front, with some brown sugar and malts in the nose. Hops cut in quickly on the initial tastes along with plenty of burned character. Alcohol hangs in there to leave you in no doubt that this is a big beer. Coffee, caramel and burned molasses come through in a rich but balanced combo. I like it!
Mouthfeel is light, despite the fact that there is a little stout-like character that cuts in at the finish.
Wow. A BIG beer with lots of character that walks a fine line, but for me just about pulls it off. This is a close one, as in general I am not a fan of huge ""Brown Ales"", but this hits the spot. It would be worth laying a few of these down."

Pour is a little disappointing. Noisy, soda like carbonation that fades quickly to almost nothing. Dubbel, drab color in the body - a little murky. Not great looking at all.
Nose has the requisite Belgian yeasts and candy, as does the taste, BUT the beer is way too sweet for the style, and is even getting close to too sweet for me to enjoy. That is saying something since I really enjoy both the Quads/BSDA and other sweet beers. This one seems as if the fermentation has not been completed and the sugar has not been converted completely to alcohol, i.e. incomplete attenuation.

Initially I have to say that I am a bit confused by this beer. Frankly I hardly get any ""oaked"" character at all. I guess that there is a very slight vanilla note in there, but without knowing I was drinking this beer I'm not at all sure I would have noticed it. This seems largely like a regular AB to me. If there is one significant difference it's the lack of sweetness that I get from the original AB.
Pour is superb. Beautiful garnet color, good carbonation, head is a super, ivory dense affair and the lace is nice. Good looking beer. Nose is hop based, but seems balanced. Similar with the taste. VERY light vanilla notes, but outside of that it's simple a bitter, hop based West Coast bomb.

This has evolved into a very complex beer. I'm guessing that fresh this was just a typical Double IPA, and that some would say that IS exactly the way it should have been enjoyed. I on the other hand, generally enjoy the way that the fading of the hops profile over time allows the big malts to come through. This certainly has a deep sweetness, with some citric bitterness still present. Probably very different to the original intention but still very nice.

To me this beer is all about BLACK cherries. The aroma and the taste are all fairly true to the real thing and to me it strikes a nice balance between sweetness up front and a little tartness in the finish.

Very smooth in the mouth and the beauty is absolutely no bitterness. The lack of coffee-bite is certainly the key to the success of this beer.

Taste is nasty. Earthy, very earthy and something like a clove infused tea. The pumpkin isn't there for me, but it seems to have been replaced by an all-spice soda. Mouthfeel is weird - fizzy and light, like a diet soda. High carbonation but it's way too raw.

Pour is a dirty, mid-brown, murky body that is not that attractive. Looks like a Dubbel - I don't like the color or the body appearance at all. Head is very small but still good considering the ABV. No lace to speak of.
Strong liquor, alcohol and sherry notes in the nose. Taste replicates this, especially the sherry. A bit of dry alcohol bitterness in the finish, but the sherry is the winning factor. My guess is that over time (I suspect this bottle is quite old) the sherry notes have developed. I like that. Perhaps some hop profile has declined.

Extremely creamy mouthfeel with a distinct (burned) chocolate feel. Sharp and very bitter finish. Bitterness lingers slightly. More stout-like than a Barley Wine (on the label), and certainly not any DIPA character as listed on the BA db.

This is certainly not a heavy beer by any stretch of the imagination, and to be honest I am generally not keen on these very light bitters but this one seemed to hit the spot.

This FINALLY makes it to GA. I had just about given up. $10.49 for the 4 pack at Smyrna World Of Beverage, Smyrna, Atlanta, GA, USA. (Also at Arbor Place for $9.99). Having really enjoyed the 2005 (22oz) version, I have been looking forward to it.
12oz bottle is poured into the Sweetwater 420 Pilsner glass. Cloudy golden body with a small but perfectly formed, compact head, great retention and some superb lace. Nose has mild hop character but not a huge amount.
Taste is unique. Almost a mild spice in the mouth, with a liquor like finish. Hop bitterness kicks in with the aftertaste that has more than a touch of metallic character too. A touch of lemon or citrus there as well. This dovetails nicely with a moreish sweetness that kicks in halfway down the bottle. Very smooth and easy drinking. Mouthfeel is slightly viscous and large, you can certainly tell that you are consuming something a little out of the ordinary and special.
Delicious, almost certainly supposed to be consumed fresh, but I wouldn't mind seeing what this does with a little age on it too."

11.2oz pour which is a huge bonus because it avoids the conversation about NOT pouring the beer into a frozen glass!
Very light, orange pour with excellent sticky, white lace. Unfortunately served waaaay too cold so you have to wait for this one to wam up a little. It's a shame theat they keep getting the temperature of these pours wrong at TM because although I don't really mind waiting a bit, after that time lapse, the head and its appearance suffer some. Ho hum.
Tasting notes are pretty identical to my earlier tasing of the bottled version. The alcohol is still amazingly well hidden, and there is a fresh hop sweetness about this beer that makes it one of the easier American DIPA's to quaff - alaraingly so at an ABV approaching 10%.
Everytime I drink this I love it, I would like to think it will become a draft staple in this parts but I doubt it will last. A little to sophisticated for around here with its tiny little glass!"

&#8206;24 oz bottle, the usual presentation. 
&#8206; 
What's this? A SN hop based beer in the classic APA/American IPA style - I've NEVER seen one of those &#8206;before, WHAT a huge departure for SN!! ;-) 
&#8206; 
Anyway, here we go. 
&#8206; 
As usual a great looking copper clarity in the body and some decent head, retention and some sticky &#8206;lace. Carbonation seems a little low, but the body is fine. 
&#8206; 
Grassy, fresh hops in the nose (imagine THAT!), and similar notes in the taste. Little else. Bitterness is &#8206;high but according to style. Malt backbone is there, but obviously in takes a lesser role. Finish is clean &#8206;with more astringent bitterness that lingers a little. 
&#8206; 
What to say? I really have run out of adjectives that distinguish this from UMPTEEN other SN beers. &#8206;Fine, but how this is diffeent from about a dozen other SN beers I fail to see.&#8206;

24 oz ""bomber"", 2007 vintage. $3.49 from Tower, Buford Highway, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Light orange body, good carbonation, HUGE head, nice lace and good general retention. Nice looking brew.
Light body with PLENTY of soapy, soapy hops! Tastes light and fresh. Wet hopped feel. The wet hops are really upfront, and I like the feel that this brings.
Tasty, but it is a rather one-dimensional soapy hop taste. Not bad, but by the end of the bottle it's waring a bit. I guess a couple of bottles each season and I'll be happy."

Ok, what we get here is a nice, malty bread based beer with a suprising hop presence (maybe that is where the Amber moniker comes from). Finishes clean and strong.

Pour is dark orange with a very thin head and no lace. Not that surprising considering the ABV. Sweet nose and hop based (imagine that!)
Pretty viscous mouthfeel (that is not exactly surprising given the ABV), but a drinkable combination of big hops and big sweetness.
This JUST pulls the combonation off - it's a close call, but considering the combination of bitterness and alcohol this remains an amazingly drinkable beer. I don't think I would want more than one, but at the same time when you consider the whole package, I'm delighted that I CAN manage even one!
Huge hops, equally large sweetness this is a beer that could ONLY be brewed in the USA. In some ways it's totally insane, but it still manages to stay (just, just, just) in the realms of drinkability. This one walks a very fine line, I bet some (non-American especially) BA's will hate it!

Hoppy nose, but it has a large degree of sweetness at the same time. This is a duplicate of the taste. Hops up front, but quickly sweet malts smooth out the beer rapidly. Nice. Creamy, smooth mouthfeel, even as far as to say this drinks like nitro pour! Delicious.

Consequently a pain in the ass to get the beer to pour.
Really disappointed in the appearance. Blood-red cloudiness, but the noisy fizziness of the beer is translated into NO head and NO lace. Poor.
Nose as expected. The taste is also a bit of a disaapointment. I don't get any cherry taste, rather just a persistent sourness (that I was expecting), but a profound lack of real taste (that I was not expecting). Weak tasting brew.
Not a patch on the De Ranke Bitter or the Pere Noel, and worse than some of their other offerings too. I just don't rate (or like) this brew. Disappointing."

Thanks go out to Kevin for the opportunity to try this beer once more.
The malt nose drifts out of the bottle as soon as it's opened, and the beer seems to fulfill many of the criteria for a beer of this type - fresh, lively, good clarity and refreshing. 
It's simple, but it's good and it reminds me a lot of the Gordon Biersch beers in the way that (typical of Sprecher) it's a beer that represents some of the Germanic based styles, nicely.
Some rounder malts than I remember from last time and the beer is both moreish and tasty.
Scores bumped up from 3.0, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5.

Frankly I was really VERY, VERY disappointed. Great head in the Duvel tulip sits on top of a mid-orange body. Not a great deal of lace or retention.
Nose gives away the source of my disappointment. Way too much sourness for a BSPA IMO. Even though the beer was NOT incredibly sour OVERALL, the acidity was sufficient to take it far enough out of the style to annoy me. Plenty of Brett and Lambic character and not much else. Any Belgian yeast character and spice is overwhelmed by the sour character that permeates the whole beer. Not my cup of tea at all.
IMO a pretty poor Belgian Strong Pale with all the sour and tart character. Give me more yeast and typical Belgian candied character please.

All I got was a vaguely sweet, slightly bitter smooth beer with some fairly significant alcohol. Went down very well. Initially any Belgian yeast characteristics were lost on me a bit (i.e. I didn't really get any), but as it warmed they came a little more to the fore.

Not really my cup of tea for an American Strong. I prefer the Bastards that seem (as odd as it sounds) to have more balance than a beer like this.

OK, I'm not the style Police, but in no way is this drinking like a BW, American OR English! One or two early comments that I had heard suggested this was a really sweet BW, more in the English style than the American, but for my money this is a typical American DIPA. Good hop presence and a simple but strong enough malt backbone hold it all together nicely.
Drinks well, and the alcohol is VERY well hidden. This is a nicely put together beer, but it does NOT resemble a BW (of either type) to me. It's another solid, American DIPA that is better than some since it doesn't have a HUGE, grating West Coast hop presence. A more subtle American DIPA (if such a thing can exist!)
Worth a try, but don't expect a BW IMO."

Thanks go out to Vancer as part of CEO/Old Farts BIF. Been wanting to try this one for a long time after I originally fell in love with some of the 471 series on a visit to Lexington, KY a while back.
12 oz bottle. Nice looking artwork screen-printed on.
Great looking beer with superb, dark amber color, good head, clarity, retention and lace.
Big malty body is perfect for the style. This feels really quite robust. Some malty sweetness in there, but the biscuit malts that I require/was expecting are taken over a little by the bitterness. This is a smidgeon too bitter for the style IMO. Slightly too edgy. If you could take the IBU's down a touch this would be a fantastic beer. as it stands I'll put it in the really good category.
Having said that, a really substantial mouthfeel and some serious body and malty goodness almost completely make up for that. A nice beer, but not the best of the 471 series I have had. Seeing as the standard of these beers has been so high, that's not too much of a crime."

First off, a cubed ESB makes no sense at all. I don't know what the brewery is trying to achieve here, but what they end up with is a pretty aggressive, relatively unbalanced, American double IPA.
Pour has a typical DIPA orange/brown hue, with some chill haze. A nice head with some lace and retention. Aroma has a really raw, organic grassy resin to it. Very piney. 
Taste is not all that aggressive in terms of hops, BUT it is extremely bitter. Not well balanced by malts and the package doesn't really come together that well. Not bad, but too raw for my liking. Edgy bitternes without subtlety.
This is not an ESB at all. Perhaps you could put it into the American Strong Ale category, but its malts are a little too weak for that as well. It essentially drinks like a DIPA.
Drinkability is not good - simply to bitter and not well balanced. A beer that needs some work I would say."

At first it seems a little light on the mouthfeel side, but I suspect that this compliments the beer nicely to make it very drinkable. Superb, sherry like aftertaste, and a really creamy finish. Alcohol is nowhere to be seen - superbly hidden, one might even say dangerously so. Not especially ""spicy"" as such, but has a slight Winter Warmer characteristic.
Overall a delightful Belgian Quad with all the right moves. Highly quaffable so you need to take care. Quality."

Anyway, back to the beer itself. From a substantial 1 pint, 3.25oz bottle with a different, updated label from the one in the BA dB, it pours slightly darker than a macro lager yellow, with a small head, some carbonation and a small ring of retention. Good clarity.
Nose has plenty of over-ripe bananas and some bubble gum. Taste has the same, but with more emphasis on the bubblegum, and with a slightly bitter finish. A mild aspirin in the finish.

I toyed with the idea of buying all four, but decided that it would be wise to try one first to see if it was up to scratch. Glad I resisted!
Dark orange, cloudy pour, perhaps due to some chill haze but it looks a bit iffy. Carbonation can be described as 'fizzy'. Some head but retention is zero. Decent aroma with some solid malts.
After that things go downhill. WOEFULLY thin in the mouth and we get a thin, mildly acidic, apple influenced, weak brew. Perhaps even going as far to say infected. Not good at all.

OK. Had a few Berliner Weissbiers in the past, but almost always with the added syrup.

I wasn't sure it would work, but in matters such as these I tend to trust DFH.
Obviously light and cloudy looking, pretty much exactly as I was expecting. Some peach in the nose, but not much. To be honest I think the ABV is a little high for the style. As for the taste, well the peach flavor does NOT make an impact in the way that the syrup would, and as a result this is basically a tart, light beer that is unsatisfied by the peach. Mouthfeel is weak. All in all, the tartness, the lack of significant flavor, the weakness of the fruit and the ABV fail to bring this beer together for me.
Quite a weak offering from DFH, this is one of those DFH beers that just doesn't quite capture it. With such innovative brewing there will always be a few misses, this is one of them."

Combined review of the two experiences.
On tap this looked great! Had a golden orange body and was served in the specific glass for the beer which is a thing of beauty itself. In the bottle at home I poured it into a Tucher Weizen 500 mL glass and it was brown! Seriously brown like dirty water or iced tea brown. Not very attractive. Both servings had good heads and decent lace. That's where the differences ended, both serving types resembled one another in all other ways.
Caramelized bananas greet the nose. Nice. A little alcohol too, this is promising. Tastes start with some clove and banana and then this kind of dries up and takes on a whole load of American IPA characteristics - aggressive hops, bittering and somewhat unbalanced. Hefe up front, DIPA in the back. Alcohol is poorly hidden and a little burning to be honest.
I dunno, to me this is an uncomfortable marriage that doesn't really work. It's not a bad beer (looked good on draught, much less attractive in the bottle), but the unbalanced hops and very prevelant alcohol both take away from the beer and reduce the drinkability for me.

Interesting story behind this purchase. I know for a fact that this particular bottle had been sitting on the shelves in the store for at least three years, and that the beer was almost certainly even older than that. I bought it with a little trepidation, but at the same time I was quite confident that the store had done the cellaring work for me. Took it down to the Brick Store for Dave, Mike, Lee and the gang to try. We were not disappointed.
Nice looking, cloudy orange pour with plenty of head, but that faded pretty quickly. The aromas were spiced as anticipated with some cinnamon, cardamon and a little all-spice. Quite strong in the nose.
Having smelled the beer I was half expecting some kind of wild onslaught against the tastebuds on the first swig, but I was amazed at how smooth it was. The spice had perfectly melded together to make a VERY mild tasting beer. A little orange zest, maybe some rosemary?? Some sweetness up front but this faded quickly to reveal more spice but it was extremely mellow. A tiny bit of funk, but not much at all - a small acidic bite. I've never had a fresh bottle of this so I have no frame of reference, but my guess is that the harsh spices mellow over time, and this is a beer that benefits greatly from aging. As Dave said, you could almost feel the mellowing of the taste - it felt aged!
All in all pretty interesting, and quite refreshing. It went down very well and was clearly a smoothed out beer that surprised me a lot. I was expecting something with much more edge; maybe the fresher bottles have that characteristic."

Original Review 08/07
===
On-tap at the Brick Store, Decatur, GA, USA.
A lighter, less sweet Duvel. A pretty good beer then.
Good golden color but lacks a little body and depth, and although the head is there it lacks great retention and is not as big as I would have liked. Aroma has some mild spice and banana, but these are a little muted. A little bubblegum and some simple esters and pineapple are present, but it lacks a bit of oommpphh.
Alcohol is prominent but balanced. Mouthfeel lacks something - not sure what.
Finishes well with sweetness, but a little less than I would have liked for the style.
I like this beer, and would drink it again, but I wonder how much of that is simply tied up in me liking the style. It may be that this is not the *best* example of the style, but nevertheless a beer that I can enjoy. Maybe a personal preference thing."

I went for the UK pint glass - I like my stouts as pints - the full 20 oz mind you, too! No girly tulip for me.
Another MASSIVE beer with a MASSIVE hype - we'll see.
Jet black, viscous pour, but to be honest the head and lace is disappointing. Creamy coffee and alcohol dominate the aroma. Mild and non-aggressive which was surprising to me (and welcome). Carbonation is low, and the mouthfeel is good (creamy) bu there is a slight hint of fine, stinging bubbles AND some residual ethanol.
Tastes are obviously coffee dominated, but plenty of alcohol too. Although the alcohol IS present, it paradoxically seems well concealed - BIG but controlled.
Finish has more alcohol residue.
Despite what I have written above, this very large beer does have most of its components under control. It does have alcohol present, but it is all in check as is the very obvious but somehow subtle coffee. This an interesting beer to me since it seems really big but at the same time quite subtle - an odd combo and difficult to pull off. Well crafted."

12 oz bottle. Pour is disappointingly flat - lack of head and lace (which to me is a real problem for a Wit) is alarming, and carbonation is light, but at the same time over FIZZY - a very odd combo. Nose has the yeast and spice, but also an odd mixture of sweet, adjunct type macros - not great. Tastes lack Wit characteristics.

IMO this is NOT a good Wit. It lacks body, and is WAY too reminiscent of a macro lager for my liking. Poor example and not very nice."

Dave pulled this one out as a sample a few days ago. He was having one hell of a time with the carbonation of the keg, and it took him forever to pour a small glass.
Pour is about as pale a yellow as you can imagine. Basically it has the appearance of a washed out or watered down Wit beer. Head was good and there was plenty of lace. Certainly a little tartness, but not especially lemony or acidic on my palate.
The guys at the Brick Store were calling this a ""childrens beer"" and there's no doubt that it drinks close to (or even below!) it's 3.00% ABV. There is simply nothing to this beer. The mouthfeel, taste, smell and whole package are all incredibly muted to say the least. I KNOW that's par for the course when it comes to the style, but this seemed even more muted than ever.

The second beer that I have had in the last couple of weeks that I would describe as a ""light"" tripel. The standard charactersitcs ARE there, but the tell-tale alcohol and Belgian candied and yeast characteristics are somewhat muted and depressed.



The upside of this is that the beer becomes drinkable and refreshing, but at the same time it is rather unsatisfying. This is compounded by the small pour which means that the glass is drained VERY quickly without the feeling of much satisfaction.

Anyway, I was discussing the likelihood that ths beer was not particularly interesting with brickstoredave, when he said, ""actually its pretty good"". Dave and I don't always agree on such matters so I was still a bit sceptical as he offered up a draft sample.



I was pleasantly suprised. Offered up as a macro colored lager with a nice, pillow-like head the first obvious departure from a ""normal"" Cream Ale is in the nose. WAY more hops than I was expecting. Don't get me wrong, this is NOT a hoppy beer, but for the style it's off the chart. This is carried through to the taste where malts still dominate but there is a distinct hop presence - again, much more than the style would usually allow. Couple this with the relatively high (again for the style) ABV, and you have a surprisingly aggressive and characterful brew.



I would say out of style, but nevertheless a really nice, refreshing and significant beer - not at all what I was expecting. Drink on!"

Bags of peppery hops in the nose, and replicated in the short, but sharp finish.

Some bubble gum in the nose.



This drinks like watered down tripel! There are hints of the Belgian yeasts, candied sugar, banana, other fruits and alcohol, but frankly the whole pacjage seems very muted. The side-effect of this is that the alcohol is also seriously muted and this feels NOTHING like the advetised 9.1%.



A bit odd to be honest - this feels like a 50-75% tripel to me, (almost) pretty typical, but just not there.

I've been wanting to get my hands on this for a long time for two reasons; firstly because Bear Republic has built a wonderful reputation with me, and secondly because I have continued to hear great things about this particular brew. It was worth the wait and BR and this beer did not let me down.



Popping the cap causes an instant strong hop aroma to waft across the kitchen. The pour is a cloudy, tan/orange combo with a good initial head and some lace. Not a huge carbonation factor at all, but still looks solid in the glass.



Plenty of sweetish hops in the nose. The smell is is not as aggressive as one might think it would be. Again some very subtle flavors. Yes there's plenty of hops, but the malts are strong and hold their own in a sweet (literally) combo. Mildly metallic, mild tangerines and slight grapefruit combine nicely in the mouth with the more astringent and acidic grapefruit rounding out the IPA experience. Definitely some citrus peel in that mix too.



Drinks under the 7.00% ABV, this is one of the West Coast beers that stays away from enormous, resinous hops and still pulls off a great IPA hop bomb without going over the top. A more difficult feat to achieve than simply piling in loads and loads of hops until the roof of your mouth is raw.

Nutty brown ale feel with a dose of centennial hops on top. Bitterness is there but it is beautifully inter-woven into the malts and the beer boasts 65 IBU's of sheer balance. A mild, tea like after taste including a tannin dry finish.
Nose is sweet and clean, and the package comes together to make the beer nigh on impossible to put down. A classic American Amber that is possibly THE best example of the style out there.

The usual spiced aromas are there, with a little clove etc.



Tastes are standard American Wit ones, but where this beer does shine is in its refreshing qualities. It seems exceptionally thirst-quenching. As a result the drinkability score goes up.

Pour yields a classic orange color with a mild cloudiness, a beautiful head, great lacing BUT a little more in the way of suspended particles than I was expecting. Were it not for those particles I might have giving this a 5 for appearance.
Nose as expected, but a little sweeter than some of the big, West Coast IPA's. Taste is pretty much as expected for a beer of the origin and the style. The hops ARE big, but there is a subtlety about the beer - an uncommon trait in this type of brew. Either the malt backbone or other features temper the hop boldness to some degree - this helps the drinkability. Mild grapefruit rounds the beer out. Less pine-resin than other West Coast examples and I think this may be why this is very well thought of by many - a more rounded example of the style.
A little alcohol warmth in the finish but its all in check. Obviously much bigger than a contemporary English IPA, but a classic example of the West Coast, American version."

This is a very light ""Belgian"" Pale and it reminded me a little of Duvel, but MUCH, MUCH lighter. Duvel light anyone?

OK, let's be quite clear about the problem here. The original Shandy is made with a mixture of mediocre beer of some desciption (either lager or bitter) and ENGLISH lemonade. English lemonade is a sugary, carbonated NEUTRAL beverage similar to Sprite or 7-Up. The whole ""lemon"" thing when it comes to English lemonade is a bit of a misnomer. NOTE TO MILLER: Do NOT use American style lemonade in Shandy's! This leads to a horrible concoction that is close to undrinkable.



This pours deep yellow color, completely clouded. The smell is of lemon scented bathroom cleaner and the taste is (what I imagine to be) not far off. A nasty, acidic ending also taints with this ""drink"", and the whole thing is what I imagine drinking lemon flavored Pine Sol would be like.

Label is black, gold and white rather than the one in the db currently.



This is the kind of beer I refer to as a craft standard. Absolutely nothing spectacular, but a solid example of the style and in some ways an excellent crossover beer for the BI's. Nice balance of malts and a little bittering hops.



Looks like a macro (except for the deeper gold color and the better head and lace) and also drinks a little like one. Obviously there is a lot more depth to the body and taste, and a ton more flavor, but it still has some typical, adjunct lager characteristics.

$8.99 at Green's, Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA. 750 mL corked & Caged. Ridge on the neck reminds me of the Westmalle or Westy bottle on steroids. Review written BEFORE reading the review in BA Mag!
Simply the best American beer I have tasted in a LONG time. Bought one last Friday and then (before trying it) popped into The Brick Store for lunch. Dave insisted on popping one purely for ""market research purposes"" (he has it on the menu for $21 which is more expensive than usual for the BS) - as soon as I tasted it I knew why.
This is one of those beers that is an instant classic. To look at it is good, but not much more than simply a solid looking Belgian brew, but the aroma and taste hit the spot exactly. A butterscotch orange body with nice (but relatively fleeting head) and some lace.
The aroma of alcohol is strong, but perfectly balanced with candy sugar and yeast. The taste develops the sugar but there is an amazing balance of orange peel to hold the sugar back and to incorporate bitterness. It's as if there are no hops in this beer but the bitterness is made up from the citrus peel. The finish is sweet, mildly tart and slightly warming. Some hint of sugared grapefruit too. Belgian sugar and yeast charcteristics are melded and incorporated perfectly.
Frankly I feel ths drinks more like a Tripel, or dare I say it, a ""Double"" Tripel! The sweetness is there but it seems to be tempered by a citric bitterness that could easily be out of place but actually dovetails perfectly.
Drinkability is off the chart for me. A classic in the making. How would this cellar??"

Plenty of lactose sweetness in the nose.



A light and easy drinking stout that manages to pull it off by still being full of flavor and satisfying. Sometimes these lower ABV stouts can be a little light and not creamy enough, but this beer pulls the whole package together beautifully.

No head and no lace apart from a little film on the top of the beer. Thinnish in all respects. Not much in the way of body or flavor. There is a little bit of a sweet and sour thing going on, but I don't really distinguish it as mustard. Mildly acidic finish.

Well, they called this a ""Golden Ale"" and named it Blonde, and it's so dark it can't possibly be either! It's basically Amber in color, but the IPA and the Raspberry Wheat were also INCREDIBLY dark in color on the same visit so I think they may just be using one malt for eveything!

Pour gives a lovely clear, rich brown color and an impressive head. Biscuit malts run across the palate making the whole experience a silky smooth, delightful experience. Plenty of body holds the beer together and as it warms it reminds me of a classic English Bitter from back home. Very mild hop presence lends a surprising complexity to this simple beer. Great stuff.



Off the chart drinkability for me, and a 5.00% it means I can enjoy quite a few - not exactly a session beer in my book, but a beer I can drink a few of with great pleasure. That's the key word - PLEASURE."

No pop on lifting the cap, and the beer pours out as a completely lifeless, murky brown tea like color. I suspect that this bottle has somehow lost its carbonation completely or is just a plain bad bottle. Still reviewing for my own records.
Despite the lack of carbonation you still get the full effect of taste and aroma. Plenty of dark fruits and sweet caramel, all dressed up in a little bit of alcohol, but nowhere near as big as the 12.0% ABV would suggest. Sherry notes too.
VERY thin in the mouth. I suspect that this stems from the carbonation problem that I am experiencing with this bottle.

Dreadfully weak aroma, taste and body. Reminds me of what it basically is - an English lager shandy. Virtually no alcohol detectable and a rather plastic, artifical taste - not even as good as a Shandy Bass in a can from the late 70's! A little smoke in there too? Sweet malts and some honey, but no lemon. I think this is because in Europe ""lemonade"" means Sprite/7-Up NOT ""lemon"".

Interesting beer. Has the taste (and aroma) of an English Barleywine up front (malty, sweet and fruity), but then finishes with a little alcohol kick and that telltale American Barleywine hop bitterness. The finish is sufficiently restrained to keep this in the English category, but it is a little more astringent than the typical, English version.
Highly drinkable considering the style and the ABV, and it marries two ends of the same style spectrum rather nicely. Good value too, I think I paid around $6.99 for a four pack."

A close look through the brown bottle reveals plenty of easily disturbed sediment. This settles quickly. Lively pour into the Duvel tulip with a good head that leaves some thin lace. Color is a macro-like golden hue.



Nose is a medicinal herb mixture with some lemon pine bathroom cleaner and a little Belgian yeast! Not quite as disgusting as that combo sounds!



The taste is VERY unusual. A combination of lemon, pine, soap, yeast, pepper and Belgian spice. Odd. The label mentions ""gin"", so I assume some juniper inspiration too.



A little thin in the mouth - lacks real body.

Cloudy, rusty orange colored pour with a big initial head that fades to give a minimal head and ring on the surface of the beer.
Plenty of soapy hops in the nose and not much else.
Astringent bitterness up front that lingers and lingers. Resinous, biting pine and not at all balanced. Malts are waaay too limited to hold up such a huge hop presence. Finishes with more bitterness, a slightly cloying mouthfeel, a burning alcohol presence and some nasty soap.
Drinks more like an American Barleywine, this beer is out of balance and horribly overloaded with messy alcohol and hops. A surprise for Flying Dog which is usually much more reliable. Maybe aged it will mellow out, but for now it's not good."

Fine carbonation, slightly prickly in the mouth. Sweet nose, a little Belgian yeast. As others have mentioned, the label says 10.5% ABV and it certainly drinks above the BA database listed 6.5%, but at the same time it is not overpowering.

Some mild pepper and hop profile in the nose makes you think this is going to be a dry, hoppy Belgian but the taste is MUCH sweeter than you would initially be led to believe.

I've really come to the conclusion that I don't like this beer very much at all.
The combination of what amounts to a wet, fresh hop presence against a malt-based, sweetish Brown Ale simply doesn't work at all well.
It simply goes beynd the American tinkering with styles and is a very good example of why pushing the envelope often ends up producing crass beers in poor taste, that taste poor!
I'm even going as far to say that this beer simply isn't very good.

On-tap at The Brick Store, Decatur, GA, USA. 16 oz pour. 
Pretty much exactly as I expected. A generally good quality beer, but WAAAAY too many hops for the Brown Ale style, BUT at the same time typical of the American version AND typical of Terrapin. Outside of that very, very little to report.
If you are looking for a malty, sweet, traditional Brown Ale (English), then don't bother, if on the other hand you are seeking a hop-based version of the style then you'll probably be very pleased.
My final thought is, ""Why do these brewers seem to need to hop-up a style that was perfectly delicious without bells and whistles?"" I don't get it."

WOW, this is RICH. Velvety and vuluptuous! Sweet malts and mild alcohol (it drinks well below the 9.2%) coupled with a silky mouthfeel gives this beer a perfect mouthfeel. Drinkability is also very high considering everything.



Huge Port and sherry notes in the aroma and the taste, but without the harshness that sometime accompany such brews. Mild dark fruits (raisins) and a little Christmas cake marzipan too. Caramelized malts and burnt brown sugars - it's a treat.

Taste is definitely vinous. It has a dry, almost white wine like quality about it with grape flavors and a very subtle dry fruit flavor. Very tasty and moreish.
Drinkability is HUGE. I was expecting a higher ABV for this beer, but the manageable 8% makes this a beer you could drink a LOT of, VERY quickly - take care.

Updated Review 02/10

Now re-released in the 22 oz format as part of the Mutiny Series. The new big beers from Clipper City have generally been a disappointment to me with some serious hot character i.e. too much alcohol, and generally rough around the edges and ill-defined. To be honest they've been clumsy which is a shame for a brewery that before the BIG series used to generally impress me.
This beer is one that ought to be able to cope with the large format and big alcohol. We'll see.
Very dark pour that is verging on black. Head is creamy and is formed noisily, both good signs. 
Nose and tastes have LARGE fruit, medicinal esters and layers of bubble gum. Quite aggressive. The alcohol is there too and the Belgian yest character is on the back-burner for this one. It still drinks nicely and just about pulls it off.
This is a CLOSE call, as it was back in 2007 with the 12 oz bottles before the Mutiny Series, but it does work for me - JUST!

12 oz bottle purchased as a single for $1.69 from Jax, Sandy Springs, GA, USA.
On the whole, pretty good. Very nice color - a real dark orange, clear pour with little or no head as expected. No carbonation to speak of. VERY fruity nose that manages to tread a unique line between a medicinal whiff and a real deep strawberry fruitiness. For me, it stays on the positive side - just! A little alcohol at the end of the nostril full.
Definite Belgian yeast taste, with typical sweet, candied sugared feel. Mouthfeel is fine, and the finish has some warming alcohol and a slight dryness to it. Unusually, a slight, lingering bitterness in the aftertaste.
A decent effort at a genuine Belgian style that lacks refinement and is a little edgy, but still drinkable. If the alcohol could be toned down a bit and perhaps the more subtle flavors brought to the fore, I think this would be a pretty decent beer."

Looking through the reviews for this beer I get the feeling that there is a pattern. To me this is a decent enough, simple English IPA with mild hop bitterness and a tiny bit of lingering grapefruit in the finish. Good malt balance is present too. Unfortunately, many American palates fail to recognize the value or the beauty in a MILDLY hopped IPA! Of course, this type of beer is much more like the English version of the style that has been hijacked so often in the US.

Pretty much pure orange color with a very fine amount of head and lace. To be honest, more head and lace than I was expecting considering the ABV.



Before getting into the specifics, this is obviously still way too hot. The alcohol is going to need at LEAST a year to even out and after that we are probably looking at several more years of great cellaring ahead of it.



Very typical of the American version of the Barley Wine style. Initial sweetness is tempered by a hot alcohol burn and wickedly bitter grapefruit and metallic finish. Aftertaste lingers and really bites with some serious alcohol warmth.



Some slickness in the mouth, but not too cloying. Not my favorite style (I prefer the original, English style) and I really should learn to lay these baby's down before I crack 'em - I'd enjoy them even more that way.

Very hoppy nose - seems quite dry. Clearly a simple beer, but why such huge hop presence even in this simple brew?

To me, a great opportunity missed.
Despite the very dry hop presence, this is still a drinkable beer, and indeed a half-decent Amber, but the harsh, dry, metallic bitter finish and aftertaste is really quite hard. For me it takes away from the beer. More malt balance required to smooth out the hops.

Classic English BW in all respects. Deep orange pour with little or no carbonation and minimal ring of lace on the surface of the beer (as expected).



Very sweet. Strong aroma is dominated by Sherry and Port notes. Alcohol comes through quite strong but this is still amazingly drinkable. Smooth, but with a kick in the finish. Aftertaste is minimal (a good thing I think). Plenty of caramelized malts and a little bitterness (in true English BW style).



No complaints, exactly as one would expect. One glass is plenty consumed alongside a large glass of water."

Dry, hop aroma that is clean. Saaz? in the nose.



Pils taste, that is clean, but this beer really lacks a BITE. There is a serious lack of bitterness and not the kind of hop presence I look for in my Pils. A lack of sharp aftertaste.



Too soft around the edges for me in the style, with a lack of crispness and an average body. Lots of potential but ultimately it fails."

If you know Unibroue beers the first thing you will notice is that this beer is by far the most easily distinguishable of all of the Unibroue range. No huge Belgian yeasty tastes that are SO patently Unibroue. Don't get me wrong, I love the classic Unibroue Belgian yeast tastes, but many of their beers are difficult to tell apart.



The smell and the taste certainly does have the smoked, peat present, but I think it seems stronger than it actually is simply because this is such an unusual brew for them.



Golden pour with a high head but no huge lacing to match. Good carbonation and some fruit aroma. Nice bitterness mixed in with the sweeter sugar notes with serve to round this out nicely. A thinner beer than you may have come to expect from Unibroue but in some ways even more balanced.

As Dave suggests, the silly glass and wooden block (like Kwak) means the kids love this without understanding the very average nature of this beer.



Looks decent with a dirty, Dubbel like color (that I am not fond of) and a nice looking (small) ivory, rocky head.



In terms of a Belgian Strong Dark, this is a very weak beer. Its main shortcoming is the mouthfeel, but the whole experience is very muted. It has a lot of potential but it simply feels like a watered down version of a style that usually delivers big time. Almost like a Belgian Dark Lite, there is a mild yeast presence, low alcohol presnce (despite the ABV) and muted fruitiness.

In typical Heller-Trum style, the aroma is a basically a side of smoked ham in a glass! A great beer to enjoy with your grilled or BBQ'ed meats.



Unlike some of the other beers in the style, I found that the smoke here did not really overpower the beer. In other examples I found the smoke to dominate to such an extent that other qualities were lost. Some nice malty sweetness that was unexpected and that melds well witht e smoke. A much fuller and more satisfying body than I was anticipating too.



I liked this a little more than I expected so I was pleased that I tried it. Another example of the value of persisting with a style that has been a little less than stellar in the past."

Huge, billowing head on the initial pour. Quite a lot of carbonation. Some chill haze as the light amber body form. Some good lacing.



Initial nose and tastes maybe give away the age of this bottle. There is a distinctly acidic feel about it and I suspect that the beer is beginning to suffer somewhat. Everything is usually great at Green's, but this beer seems to be an unusual exception. Mildly sour lambic qualities that I am sure should not be present!

Rogue is stamped all over this. Huge hops that give a cloying bitterness that is not subtle in the least. The hops cut into the finish and even over-shadow the relatively high ABV.

Plenty of citrus hops in the nose and this is replicated in a BIG way in the initial taste. On first taste this seems like a big, West Coast hopped, resious, citrus and floral DIPA, but the finish cuts in quickly to remind you of the malt balance which is also large. The finish is actually alarming sweet given the upfront hop presence. Huge citrus followed by a devastating combo of alcohol and sweetness.

Many, many degrees darker than any Saison I have experienced, in fact it looks more like a Dunkel of some description.



Thin body, and lacks any kind of farmhouse funk aroma. Atypical in that respect too. Not much to this beer, in fact rather bland outside of a very, very bitter finish (grapefruit and dry tea). In fact the over-stewed tea-like look of the beer and the tanin taste are the major features of this brew. Rather odd if you ask me, not really part of the contemporary Saison crowd, and in addition really difficult to pin down outside of that moniker too. Frankly I didn't like it much."

A dirty brown, Dubbel like pour with some great head and lacing and quite a bit of floaty yeast sediment. All the components of a quality Belgian are there with the aroma and tastes having the standard dark fruits and spicy depth. All the attributes are enhanced as it gently warms. A beer that definitely benefits significantly from the temperature increase. Alcohol is evident, but still controlled. Big candied fruits in the finish with less than subtle sweetness. The finish gave me a little warming alcohol as well as some surprising acidity.

Very smooth, silky mouthfeel that is almost slightly slick, makes this feel like a much higher ABV beer than it really is. Crisp initial sweetness (almost honey like) gives way to a mildly bitter finish that builds slightly in the aftertaste. Mild lingering hop finish. A nice combo indeed.

The guys that are guiding this company, and those that are brewing these beers are truly extraordinary, BUT in a way that many in the USA do not appreciate. Many US brewers are simply piling in loads of hops/malt/alcohol or whatever, in order to produce silly, ramped-up versions of classic styles that are frankly more miss than hit. Many of these beers are crass and in bad taste (in both senses of the word), but DFH continues to manage to walk the fine line between everything that is good in America/American brewing (i.e. entrepreneurial spirit and daring experimentation) BUT AT THE SAME TIME creating innovative styles that do not trample all over tradition (a rather unusual attribute in the USA and especially in US ""monster"" beers). Anyway, you can probably tell that I respect DFH a lot more than many American brewers for their ability to be TRULY innovative WITH class - it's an uncommon combo.



Back to the beer in question. 



A capped, 750 ml bottle, $10.99 Green's, Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA. (BTW, I think this should be a 10% ABV). Bottled 02/09/07.



A significantly red tinge to the copper colored pour as it sits in the Brasserie de l'Abbaye des Roc chalice. A nice, noisy pour with significant (if somewhat short-lived) head and some nice lace. 



A Wit ""type"" nose, but with a heavier emphasis on the spice.



The combination of spices and aging produces a smooth beer with a definite Belgian Pale Ale feel. Reminiscent of a ""light"" Duvel. Surprisingly sweet but finishes wit a mild hoppy bitterness.



A lovely beer that certainly has the potential to elevate beer in social circles and is typical of the kind of brew that can make our mission as BA's easier when trying to espouse the virtues of craft beer as an alternative to wine at the dinner table.

Very light, crisp and refreshing, this beer would come into its own in the summer months and I would hazrd a guess that it would be a big hit with the ladies.

If I had to blind taste this I would have described it as an English/American Barleywie hybrid.

Plenty of caramel and some dark fruits - figs and other Christmas type tastes.



Nice noisy pour with some frothy head and a little lacing. Suprising clarity and some good carbonation considering the ABV. In fact for a beer close to 11%, it definitely has some life beyond what one would expect. Bags of sweet malt upfront in the nose and the taste, and a touch of alcohol in the aroma.



Again sweet malts dominate the taste, but there is very mild bitterness in the short finish in addition to some liuor like character.

At first glance this appears to pour jet black with a small coffee colored head with some garnet hues, but a closer look reveals a dark raspberry red/brownish color. This color is especially vivid when there is only a very small amount in the glass.



Aroma is a milk chocolate sweetness and a hint of fruit but nothing close to the strong smells that some others have reported.



Thin in the mouth, and that respect this is barely stout-like at all, so I think the Fruit Beer moniker is correct. The raspberries are muted to me. They cut in right at the finish, but do not linger. What does linger is the acidic tartness which could be from a number of different fruits. Some milk chocolate cooking chocolate bitterness too.

Pours like a Dubbel with that typically unattractive thin looking, dirty, mid-orange/brown pour. I dislike the look of Dubbels in general, and although this is not necessarily billed as one, that's what it looks like. Plenty of fine sediment particles present and some pretty decent carbonation. If anything, a little too much for the style for me. Not much head and not much lace. Appearance generally looks thin, and is a little disappointing to me.



Luckily it drinks better than the looks would suggest. Plenty of yeast notes with mild ester based fruit. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side for my liking and the alcohol is very well hidden. Finish is dry, yeasty and has a small amount of bitterness that you would not necessarily expect. Maybe a little spice too, but not a great deal.



For me this definitely lacks the depth of a Belgian Strong Dark, and is MUCH more like a Belgian Strong Pale, despite the slightly darker color of the beer.



Glad I tried it, but I want a Belgian Dark that looks darker, has a more substantial mouthfeel and has much more depth in general. Although the ABV is up there, I prefer something that shows the alcohol more. A bit lightweight for the style for me."

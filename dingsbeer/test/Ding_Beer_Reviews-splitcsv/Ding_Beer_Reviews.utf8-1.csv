Batch 352 which I think says 12/19/10 as the bottled on date, but I bought this way before that so that cannot be correct. My suspicion is that is a best before date. Anyway...
Black pour with some brownish highlights. Not much head, very little lace, but it settles to give a spotty, creamy film on the surface.
Nose offers plenty of hop character, and it is typically aggressive for the style and the two breweries involved. 
That carries forward to the taste where the hops could be described as medicinal. It's not so much a question of bitterness, but there is a distinct flavor of herbal charcoal note.
There is a creamy element to the beer which suggests a hoppy stout rather than something lighter.
Not bad, but not a beer or style that I ever likely to fall in love with."

Pour is a tad disappointing as the beer sits somewhat lifeless with a classic macro look - no head, no retention, no lace and a golden body. Color is fine, carbonation is not. Head is particularly disappointing to me.
Nose and tastes give a distinct vegetal sweetness and a malty experience that feels musty and old. No date on the bottle that I can see, so who knows? Finish lingers a little, but not really ina manner that one would want. Feels 'stale', but with no dating how are we supposed to know. Maybe this is a fresh bottle that always tastes like this!
This is quite a dry beer, but that doesn't save it from being a really lackluster effort. I'm not sure if it's the age of the beer or it's general lack of appeal, but it fails to satisfy on a number of levels.
Quite poor."

Any wispy head that was there on the initial pour dies really quickly above a fizzy looking, golden colored body. Pretty poor looking.
No apparent nose, even on warming.
Tastes are the usual combo of vegetal sweetness, high carbonation and a malty blandness that is distinctive only in relation to its non-descript nature.
Not really much here that is too offensive, however it really only says macro swill, so...there you have it."

I have had some really good success with some of these budget brews, but there have also been one or two stinkers so it's always an adventure - let's see what we have here.
The beer goes into the 500 mL Tucher Weizen glass. It's color is definitely out of the ordinary for the style. It's deep, orangey copper which is a long way away from a typical, lemony yellow body. The head is good initially, and to be fair doesn't fade as badly as many other cheaper beers, and even produces a little lace and retention. The color is striking if for no other reason than it's a little odd!
Tastes do replicate some very mild banana notes but the beer lacks a cutting edge. It feels a bit bloated and buttery and does not give a serious, sharp tang. 
The finish threatens more Hefe character, and to be honest it does deliver a little more, but at the end it feels a bit flabby for the style.
Having said that I was still happy purchase; didn't expect a lot, so wasn't disappointed."

Opens with a fearful pop with a button mushroom like cork - I suggest great care opening this one, but to be honest I would rather have it that way than without sufficient carbonation. Nice gun smoke.
Attractive reddish brown hue which seems less muddy than the usual Dubbel appearance which is a bonus. Having said that beer is a dreadfully disappointing head and it fades horribly. No lace, no retention - shame.
Light, alcoholic breadiness in the nose, but it's pretty muted.
The tastes are a very nice malty, lightly alcohol based fruitiness. I feels quite bready and has a little depth as well. A touch of caramelized raspberries in the back and the finish offers more of the alcohol soaked, marzipan based maltiness - very nice.
Tastes are the strong point here but the head retention is terribly poor."
"De Scheldebrouwerij","Hop Ruiter","","","Belgian Strong Pale Ale","8.0%","bottle","3.7","4.5","4","3.5","4","3.5","4/7/11","So I've been eying this 750 mL bottle in the store for some time and assumed (from afar) that it would be a Belgian IPA (considering the name), but was a little surprised to see it in the BA db as simply a BSPA. Additionally it was reviewed in this months BA magazine and was given the moniker 'Belgian Strong Golden Ale'! Seems like the beer has a identity crisis. Either way I'm pretty confident that I know what this beer will taste LIKE, it really depends to what degree that the white pepper, spice notes, alcohol, Belgian yeast/candy and hop character kick-in, before we can assign it its rightful place on that particular sliding scale.

Into the Duvel tulip she goes.

A pretty deep orange gold color on the body with some really lovely head, lace and retention. Beer looks bright and lively.

Nose gives up a little bitterness but not a great deal.

The tastes are a confusing mixture of things for me. what I would call a threatening hop base and a lurking Belgian yeast note but neither really come to the fore with any force. There is also an underlying sweetness that makes me almost think 'tripel' for a second, but then that is snatched away too. There are plenty of surprising floral notes too, which all adds up to a crazy package. I don't dislike it, but at the same time it never really delivers one thing or another. It's not a Belgian IPA, nor is it a really clean BSPA, and in that respect to be honest it disappoints a bit.

In addition I like the alcohol in a beer of this style to bite a little more than it does here. Needs a dash more pepper or solvent bite.

A beer that really doesn't know what it is. Like I say, not unpleasant, but a beer that falls between several stools for me and slightly lets me down. I wanted to like this more. Shame."

On the neck label the Batch # (2), and the bottle count (205/450) are noted.
Pour is a dark, chestnut brown with quite a lot of sediment, a lovely rich, coffee colored head, some which brings with it some decent retention and lace.
Big 'ole which malty notes with some sherry and alcohol. 
Tastes reflect that, but come in with a bit more subtlety. The sherry and alcohol notes are reflected early, but then we get more chocolate character.
Body is a touch thinner than the style and the nose would suggest, but the shortcomings are not significant and still delivers a smooth feeling.
Interesting. A beer that seems to sit closer to a coffee-based, chocolaty porter or stout than an American Strong. Definitely low hop character for the style, and the mouthfeel doesn't match.
Interesting beer."

Had no idea this was a Ridgeway beer until I looked at the label very carefully.
A really pretty color on the pour with plenty of ruby red highlights throughout the beer. Conservative head but still gives decent retention and some nice lace. However, the color is the star in the appearance; quite exquisite.
Nose and tastes give a mild smokiness that permeates the air above the beer. The beer is quite sweet and the malts dominate. There's no doubt that this is a unusual beer. At first this is not a surprise to me since an English Porter will certainly be less aggressive and more subtle than the American version of the style, but that's not where this ends. In reality this beer is really more like a smoked Dark Euro lager than even an English Porter, and it does not feel especially rich or creamy, but it is a very tasty and drinkable beer. The smoke is really subtle, sweet and light and it works really nicely.
Mouthfeel is definitely light.
A little unusual, so if you can accept that it is definitely NOT an American Porter (that shouldn't be hard), and also that it's not a very typical English Porter either (less easy to accept), and take it for what it is, you'll probably enjoy it."

Very typical for the style, a cloudy and turbid brown soup like affair with some big, rocky, pitted, off-white head and lace. Retention is not great. It's a bit of an ugly looking beer for me.
Nose and tastes deliver typical big, hoppy alcohol notes, and there is the requisite dry finish. 
Strangely, the alcohol is fairly well hidden during the drink, but in the aftertaste and at the end the beer packs its' full punch. The combination of the dry character (good) and the somewhat overbearing alcohol (bad), make this a one and done beer for me.
Not a bad example, but it's too aggressive for me and I found it a bit muddled and lacking focus."

Chilled this off perfectly and the medium pop on opening the corked & caged bottle produces some nice gun smoke. 
The head 'fizzes' up initially but of course it does not last and there is not much lace or retention. A very thin film of bubbles sit atop the beer.
The color is REALLY memorable. A very, very distinct lemon colored, yellow body. Super bright in terms of the hue and a stand out feature of the brew.
The nose is fresh and bright if somewhat predictable. Some apple notes and a little tart alcohol.
Tastes strike all of the right notes. Light, tart cider, citrus brightness and Brett fusion. Sharp and tart without lingering, the beer is clean. I really light the carbonation that seems perfect. It dances on the tongue and titillates but never gets prickly like beers of this type, can. As the beer warms I get a little more sweet character with some fruit coming through. Citrus. Green apples and gooseberries.
Overall a lovely, tasty beer which simply summarizes what RR does magnificently well."

Pour gives lots of typical, American Adjunct Lager classic traits, but the body is a quite strange glassy affair with alarming clarity. As is son often the case the beer produces an initially very good head, but it fades very quickly and leaves no lace. Poor retention.
Nose is slightly vegetal but with no really offensive notes.
Tastes are much the same as the nose in terms of their neutrality and non-offensiveness but the lend a little more sweetness than the nose would have initially suggested. Bright carbonation leads to a refreshing, breaking crispness across the palate.
The beer feels clean to me which s definitely in its favor and a malty sweetness than I don't mind, but truth be told like so many other there really is no distinguishable or quantifiable 'taste' present other than the usual."

Nothing on the label to suggest that this beer has Jai Alai as the base, but reading the reviews it apparently does.
The label is attractive and it suggests a fruity, rich experience is in store - that doesn't really happen for me.
Pour is a VERY attractive deep copper color with a high, fluffy head. The color is very rich and reminds me of one of those high def photographs that has that orange hue. The beer looks rich.
The aroma is also VERY strong. As soon as the cap is popped the beer starts to exude that pine notes associated with Jai Alai.
Unfortunately there is a fairly strong solvent alcohol taste that comes with the beer which to be honest, overwhelms any fruit character for me. I get VERY little fruit here at all, and it feels largely like a pretty standard, aggressive American IPA. Lots of bitter metallic notes which is OK, but it still leaves me craving a tropical fruit splash.
This is one pretty beer, and it's OK, but I would have LOVED a whole bunch of luscious fruit to come through in the taste; it just doesn't so in that respect a bit of a miss. Perhaps the label misled me a bit, and I felt slightly disappointed."
"Jailhouse Brewing Company","Midnight Special India-Style Black Ale","","","American Black Ale","10.0%","bottle","4.45","4.5","4","4.5","5","4.5","3/26/11","So, I had heard about the new limited, special series that Glenn at Jailhouse was going to release and this one popped up at Green's on Buford yesterday. $8.99 for the large (bomber like) bottle.
Part of the new, Solitary Confinement Series; Cool! Not sure that I understand the label with the train bearing down on the convict in his bed, but, hey...whatever!
The pour is a very rich looking, dense, totally black affair that pours with a real, 'gloop, gloop' noise as it comes out of the bottle. Heady is creamy.
The nose gives some light hops and is restrained, and balanced.
Tastes? OK, let's cut directly to the chase here - for ALL intents and purposes this is mildly hoppy, very creamy stout. It's VERY tasty, but if you come here looking for a typical (in so much as one can achieve for the newish style) Black India Ale then you may get a jolt.
Mild hops are the key with a REALLY creamy feel. Malt sweetness is VERY well represented too, and as is the case with ALL Jailhouse beers, this brew is finely balanced and not aggressive. A very large amount of dry chocolate character for me too, but it's not a dry cocoa or bakers chocolate - rather its a much richer, more milk chocolate like taste on my palate. The hops are present but at the same time they are definitely a backseat presence. They manifest themselves more in the finish and aftertaste rather than up front but even then they are countered with plenty of sweetness. The creamy feel is maintained throughout the beer for me.
Look, I have to be honest here. When I heard about the Jailhouse special series I was VERY excited. Then, when I saw the first one had ""India-Style Black Ale"" on the label I was really disappointed (NOT my favorite style, and I was worried about bandwagon jumping). However, when I cracked the bottle and drank the beer, I found that this was essentially a lightly hopped, really creamy, well-balanced stout so I had no need to worry.
Good grief, Glenn is making some superb beer, and if you ignore the style designation, this is another. Wow!"

Pour produces some nice sticky, white lace on top of a slightly murky, brown body. Not really very interesting to look at but at the same time the head is decent, produces some nice lace and is somewhat well retained.
Nose offers little other than some sweet malts.
The tastes are fairly ordinary with a few hoppy hints amongst the fairly dry, average malt base. Drinks easily and has good carbonation for the style. 
No groundbreaking moments here, just a solid, domestic version of a style that lacks much definition or character. Probably best sourced close to its home, very fresh and perhaps even on-tap."

Pour is a deep gold color with a pretty spectacular head (if somewhat light), but the lace is very good. Nice retention.
The carbonation seems a touch on the high side.
VERY strong hoppy aroma which is frankly a bit surprising. 
The hops threaten a bit at the start of the beer but never really amount to the threat of the burst that came in the nose when the ring-pull was first broken. There's a light, floral touch about the beer but the carbonation is not in check enough to make the beer really reach its potential. Prickly feel is a bit annoying to me and take away from the overall experience.
Pretty tasty, but I'd enjoy a little more malt presence to back up the green hops, and of course the use of the word 'session' on the can is simply factually inaccurate, but it's still a tasty beer."

Beer pours a very cloudy, chocolate brown color with a very, very modest head. Lace is minimal. In stronger light the beer takes on more orange hues. Does look especially attractive, but having said that a great Mild is seldom a stunning looker, so there is a degree of authenticity about that!
Nose is a very nutty affair - noticeably so in fact. Surprising. If this were a blind taste taste I would guess that this was a brown ale with nut character of some description. As the beer warms, the nutty character seems to morph into a yeast and nut combo.
The beer does not replicate the nutty character of the nose which frankly is a good thing, but is does leave a little residual in the back end.
The beer is simply balanced with a pleasing drinkability that goes down easily, but it seems a long way removed from an English Dark Mild to me. No sweat, I'm just delighted to get the chance to drink a well balanced, tasty beer that comes in at session strength - it is LITERALLY difficult to be able to do that these days in the US.

Pour is an impressive, bright golden color with some lovely clarity, good carbonation, a nice, tight white head with some good retention and lace. Attractive no doubt with some great depth of orange color in the golden hue. Nice.
The nose offers a little breadiness amongst the sweet malts and a a hint of toasty grains.
Tastes give more of the toasty grain character and a honey elements that is more on the clover and fragrant side of things rather than intensely sweet. A beer that is warm in character and gives subtle hints and notes that will escape many. The bread element never leaves, and this beer is one that is probably best suited to cooler months. Surprisingly hearty, filling and satisfying for a beer with a light touch.
Drinkable? Certainly, but I'd need to be in the mood for this. If I were, this is a beer that I could drink a lot of despite its non-session beer ABV."

Nose gives up a little maltiness but to be honest it really is nothing to crow about. Some sweetness and a dash of alcohol but not much else, even on warming.
Tastes are pretty sweet which is OK for the style, but follows up with some significant bubble-gum that is a little grating. There is quite a lot of ester character with pineapple definitely in there, but the beer never really delivers that specific, Belgian yeast elements that I'm looking for. Alcohol is a touch solventy for me too.
I dunno I was expecting more I guess, as a beer I had heard a lot about and in one of my favorite style ought to excite me more than this did. I found it sweeter than it should be with not much subtlety or interest."

Light foil on the neck of the bottle.
New Holland is one of the few brewers that get to NC but not to GA, so I generally pick up something from them every time I'm up in NC.
Inky black pour with a modest head. Some nice, then mocha film sit atop the black body. Carbonation is reserved but entirely appropriate.
Nose and tastes give a fairly significant sweet effect. Some alcohol and lots of dry chocolate in the finish. A little warmth but considering the ABV the beer is pretty drinkable and the alcohol is largely hidden.
Actually the whole package seems surprisingly light to me, especially in terms of the mouthfeel. No slickness or difficult coating of the mouth.
The biitterness is not really that evident until the aftertaste when a combination of very light charcoal, smoke, dry bakers chocolate and a touch more alcohol come together.
Smooth, relatively well disguised alcohol and a beer that is typical of the American version of the style. No t my favorite, but a solid 'B' for me."

The bottom line with Sprecher is that they produce some great examples of simple styles, that are generally under-appreciated outside of their immediate locale, and by America geeks in general.
Simple black body with a modest head.
The thing I like about both the nose and taste associated with this beer is that they both represent a VERY light, balanced profile that sits in a drinkability range which is accessible. The ABV, although it could be much lower, also adds to the drinkability, ad the beer is one that one can really attack as a satisfying DRINK as opposed to SIPPING!
Very light malts and a gentle bakers chocolate touch on the beer. Light in the mouth with a pleasing kiss of bitterness in the back end. Finish is dry as expected, but again it's perfectly balanced and only represents a subtle brush with that characteristic.
Impressive, tasty, drinkable and overall just a really pleasing beer. Not the first time that I've said that about Sprecher."

Superb color on the pour, giving a beautiful, garnet clarity that I seldom see these days. Color is deep and present. Head is to be frank, a little disappointing. Small, not well retained although the lace defies he lack of retention.
Nose and tastes give up a classic biscuit malt and a light touch which defines the style (at least in the bottle). Some hoppy notes are added to the alcohol which produce a nice balance of drying malts and satisfying digestive like tastes.
The beer fills a HUGE void in the USA for lovers of the style, and whilst we all know that the cask equivalent would blow this away, it still represents a solid offering that helps define a bottled version of the style.
Lovely weight, excellent balance and a beer that I will turn to time and time again (as long as I can get it).

Retro style can which is attractive - good times.
Slightly hazed with a macro colored pour, the beer appears similar to a macro adjunct with perhaps a notch above in terms of color and head. lace and retention are still huge issues though.
Nose and tastes deliver a macro adjunct experience as well, but it is less sweet and offensive than many in a similar group. Fairly neutral in the final analysis, but not really offensive or too sweet. Clean beer with a lack of linger aftertaste or unpleasantness.
Carbonation seems appropriate and the beer does what it is supposed to.

Body is a golden color with a disappointing lack of carbonation - weak to be honest.
Pretty offensive, sweet, grainy corn hits the nose and palate and never gives anything more than that. Vegetal notes and a more than average sweetness drives home the adjunct feel.
Not good, difficult to consume and typically Minhas. that adds up to a write-off for me. Blah. Belch. Meh."

I approach this beer with a mix of trepidation, excitement and interest since I feel that it is likely to bring together two elements of beer that are usually at opposite ends of the enjoyment spectrum for , namely Belgian yeast and character at one end (the good), and aggressive, hoppy, high ABV American Barleywines at the other (the bad) - it promises to be quite the experience.
The pour is a VERY attractive, bright dark copper with some lovely clarity and a surprisingly good head considering the ABV. Lace and retention are also above average, certainly a good looking beer.
The Belgian character is evident immediately and I'm glad of that! It does manage to sustain the yeast notes throughout as well. Ultimately it DOES deliver the more harsh, hoppy, high ABV notes that one would associate with the regular version of OG, and that's OK with me even if it's not my preference.
The sugary alcohol clashes a little with the more subtle, Belgian nuance (and it's even worse when the hops crash in), but since the American influence seems to cut in very late in the beer, it does seem to 'work'. The lateness of that appearance helps the beer overall but it does significantly shorten the enjoyment of the backend and aftertaste and finish of the beer. In the end though, not too much lost.
It's definitely a little bit 'mad', and certainly in the Stone mold of beers that push limits but this is one that does work for me - others have not.
All in all it's clean, delivers at both ends of the spectrum and manages to keep the disparate, fighting influences if not exactly in harmony, at least at arms length. In the final analysis I found it surprisingly good."

Heard a lot of buzz about this beer in the last couple of weeks as LA/Port has recently made it to GA. For some reason (not sure why) I was under the impression that this was going to be largely a draught offering, so I was a little surprised to find it in bottles.
Pour is an attractive hazy marmalade color with a large, three finger head but doesn't quite give the magnificent and sticky lace that such a good head should bring, and one that is often associated with the style. In that respect slightly disappointing in terms of the look.
The nose is big, green, resiny and has a 'whole-hop' type feel - quite aggressive.
The tastes (unsurprisingly) follow suit, but rather than bringing with them a tangerine or grapefruit fruitiness, the beer drives home even more bitter green pine. It lacks a sweet element for me, and that's no good in a DIPA for me.
All the elements are there for this to be a super west coast IPA, but the malt bill comes up WAY too short for me, and it's almost as if I needs a couple of spoonfuls of sugar mixed in to the beer or even a splash of sweetened grapefruit juice."

22 oz bottle with some really thick gold wax on top. Ding and the wax go to battle for a few minutes before I manage to prise the cap off. Wax seal like affair has 2011 embossed into the wax.
Pour is the requisite black, inky body, but with a very well retained head and some nice, cappuccino, sticky mocha colored lace.
The mouthfeel is pretty silky without being remotely cloying at all. Very smooth even considering the style. 
Tastes reflect the style well, but it's quite sweet and mild. It's not that the honey actually shines through as a taste or even as a harsh sweetness, but it certainly significantly takes the edge off things - really rich and non-bitter.
There is a hint of hoppy character WAY in the back of the back end, but it is really not significant.
Alcohol is INCREDIBLY well hidden.

What is this??
Expecting an Amber/Red of *some* description I get a honey-colored, slightly hazy beer that, apart from the big, fluffy head, appears to be a macro color.
The nose and tastes are SUPER sweet and grainy. I mean SWEET, even by my standards that can usually tolerate a lot of sweetness. There's a corny maltiness about the beer too. Metallic features amongst the vegetal notes. Some alcohol.
Strange, and if this is an Amber/Red then I am a Dutchman. ZERO out of five for the style, and pretty undrinkable to boot as well. The head is decent, retained to some extent and overs some watery lace, but utside of that this is fairly odd and virtually undrinkable. Nasty."

The beer comes as a hazed, mid-orange pour with the emphasis on the cloudy nature of the beer. Quite 'dense' looking which is OK for the nice, two-finger head that forms, but less appealing in the body of the beer.
Typical, west coast, American IPA is the simple analysis here; large, piney, resinous grapefruit in the nose which intensifies on warming. More of the same in the tastes with perhaps a bit more sweet grapefruit than the nose would suggest. Simple aftertaste and a few hoppy burps - a good sign.
Alcohol quite well hidden.
Served too cold, this beer benefits from warming a bit and could do with a body that was less clouded. Apart from that it's a typical, solid, west coast example fo an IPA which is both good and bad - you get what they say you will get, but at the same time the beer could honestly be one of dozens and dozens of other beers - ultimately, OK, but largely forgettable and nondescript. I'm looking for something a bit 'cleaner' both in look and taste to give higher scores."

The beer has very little hint of being a Winter Warmer and frankly no winter spice element that I can detect. It drinks like a thin, acidic, slightly off brown ale that may be on the brink of developing a large infection. Some slight lacto elements, the beer is pretty poor under any guise, and a tragic Winter Warmer.
Too light in the mouth and a nasty acidic aftertaste pull the shambolic 'beer' together.

Nose gives plenty of sinus clearing, fruity acidity - as expected.
Tastes reflect the nose but with a touch more aggression and more residual drying effects from the oak. I like the carbonation which seems to add some life to the beer. A bit higher than normal for the style, and it brings a touch of CO2 into the taste - I like that.
Pretty solid example although I think that there are beers that offer a lot more subtlety even within/considering the style. This lends a typical, in your face American approach which grates on me after a while. The acid is a bit all over the place, and crashes into me a little too much to suggest refinement.

Kolsch? Nope.

The nose instantly gives a fairly significant blast of hops, and the tastes replicate some of the hop bitterness too. Also present is a large malt backbone which holds the whole thing together. Aftertaste is quite dry.
In a blind taste taste I would put this down as being an old, American IPA. It fails the 'look' test for a Kolsch and has very little resemblance to the style no matter how one cuts it.

Surprised to see this at The Beer Dispensary in Apex, NC, USA. Not an Urthel beer that I have ever seen in the US before.
Pour gives a pretty standard, honeyed, hazed, lemon color with a nice creamy white foam on top. Some nice lace as the beer sits in the Brasserie de l'Abbaye des Rocs goblet.
A significant, sweet earthiness permeates the nose of this beer right from the get go. Organic feel about the beer.
In typical Urthel fashion the tastes are a little reminiscent of a Belgian IPA with some significant bitterness and a little hoppy note in the finish. The hoppy bitterness breaks the white pepper bitterness open a touch, and *slightly* moves the beer to a different level from your typical Saison.
The aftertastes accentuates the soapy, hoppy bitter section but it never gets aggressive and always feels within, if somewhat prodding at the edges, of the style.
Tasty, and a touch off-beat for the style but for me it works well. Nice"

Pour is a rich, golden color with good clarity but a few hints of hazy cloud. Head forms quickly, is small, light and fluffy and fades to yield no more than a thin film and next to no lace.
Nose is interesting. As well as the tart acidity that one is expecting, there is also a fleeting whiff/hintof the green-feel hops. However, this slips away quickly to give way to the acidity in the blink of an eye.
The tastes mirror the nose with the apple acidity barging past a minor hop kiss to yield a typical wild rather than one that flirts with any hop presence. Each mouthful tempts us with hops, but within a few seconds it's all gone, snatched away by a more classic, wild element. Puckering acidity in the initial tastes lets up to give a more manageable and somewhat familiar fruit acid as the beer warms and is is consumed.
A very nice example of a 'yet-to-be-well-defined' style with the tiniest of nods to the hops, but if you've EVER drunk a west country cider in the UK you've seen this ALL before. The similarities between this beer and the cider that I grew up with as a thirteen+ year old are inescapable and have extreme synergy. All the way from the puckering apple acidity, through the light, manure funk and into the first quenching, then drying mouthfeel, this beer is ultimately no more than an American version of a British classic and it owes its existence to a place, time and beverage that has gone before."

I've had this beer a few times before, but this is the first review.
There is absolutely no doubt that the nose that the beer generates is absolutely unique and extraordinary. A big, fat, green, fresh hop presence that lingers and is the highlight of the beer for me.
The copper colored, clear body gives a tremendously impressive head and a lot of sticky lace. Good signs.
Some metallic notes and plenty of bitterness that lingers and drives the beer into some dark territory. The beer is actually increasingly aggressive and doesn't let up much. Slight alcohol burn in the back end, finish and burn in the end. Plenty of resinous pine but lacks much grapefruit based sweetness. Quite harsh but paradoxically drinkable.
Hoppy burps ensue.

Nose has a surprisingly lack of coffee element and is mainly dominated by a malty, alcohol note.
The mouthfeel is very light which I suppose could be taken one of two ways. Either the beer is very drinkable and easy, or it lacks presence for a beer that with the ABV should really be an Imperial Porter. The tastes lack coffee for me and only replicates a simple alcohol based malt beer which does not have much presence. Meh...
I dunno, this comes up short for me in virtually all areas. It ought to have more depth, it ought to have more coffee, it ought to have more taste but it doesn't.

Cork is wedged in pretty tight, it is a pain to open. Also, the lack of 'pop' and lack of gun-smoke is a little disappointing.
In anything other than bright light, the beer looks black. In stronger light the body is seen to be a shade or two lower getting into the very, very dark brown region with even a few red notes/highlights in the extremities.
Aggressive pour was required (at least by me, since I am a fan of creating some decent head on the beer). Tan head is short-lived and recedes to give a thin, spotty film on the surface. Considering the ABV, I can live with both the carbonation and the head, even if I would like them both to be more substantial.
Nose offers tremendous sweet malts, alcohol and a light licorice element. It permeates the room from the glass!
The licorice is carried forward into the tastes, but unlike some other, similar licorice elements in other beers this one offers a sugar coated experience with a lack of bitterness. The alcohol is definitely in the picture (and at 13%, why not?), and there is plenty of rum and raisin character that comes through.
Massive sweet marzipan, other almond tastes and further brown sugar, licorice and dark fruits collide quite violently on the tongue.
The aftertaste is that of a classic, English Barleywine with a barrage of even more alcohol and further light roasted caramel and a REALLY pronounced warming effect.
The mouthfeel offers some 'better than expected' prickliness and a paradoxically smooth (but more 'in character') middle and finish.
Look, this is a BIG beer in all respects, but it does manage to pull off a tremendous combination of attributes that are all within the style. It's NOT for the feint of heart, nor is it for those who do not like the classic dark fruit based, Belgian candy styles, or beers that are not sweet. However, if you ARE in that category (as I am), you're gonna love this. 
Considering the ABV, the beer is off the charts for drinkability.

Relatively new entrant to the Atlanta market. Th e pour gives a clear, copper colored body with a one finger head. Head is unfortunately poorly retained and there is virtually no lace. Color is pretty though.
I'm very surprised at the hoppy nature of the nose. It's quite striking under any circumstances, and considering the style that is even more amazing. The tastes also give up some of that hoppy element, but it's not quite as strong as the nose initially suggests.
The beer is quite clean and dry, and imparts a refreshingly metallic note. The bitterness builds quite substantially.
Not at all what I was expecting for the advertised style, and the beer combines an interesting combo of styles that sit somewhere between an IPA and dry, clean red/amber ale. It's very hoppy when considering the APA style."

It seems to me that Bell's are getting away with a little something here. They are filling a gap in the US market, but they are doing it with a beer that's not very good. However, the gap in the market make it looks better than it really is. It's a missed opportunity.

The pour is a particularly attractive, gold color with a moderate, white head. It looks really nice in terms of the color, but I would much prefer a bigger and better retained head. It lacks a little in that department, but the color is really superb. Very nice carbonation.
The nose delivers the usual Schlenkerla bacon smoke, but it seems more complex and layered than some of the other Schlenkerla beers. The oak smoke seems VERY intense, but paradoxically more subtle than some of the similar beers from the brewery. The oak clearly brings a different feel. The beer lingers too. 
Complex malts with plenty of sweetness to compliment the smoke. There is also a lingering bitterness that builds and as the beer is consumed it really feels mildly hoppy at the end - THAT, I wasn't expecting. Strangely, the ending also comes in sharply sweet. It also delivers a little bit of solvent like alcohol in the finale.
A VERY complicated beer for me with plenty of rich, layered and competing factors that compliment one another brilliantly. A tremendous experience for me.

Nose has some dry, grainy alcohol and a little degree of sweet malt.
There is a hint of bitterness that permeates the beer (good), but it also delivers a paradoxical grain based, vegetal, corn sweetness. The alcohol (solvent) comes through in a bit, more in terms of taste than burn.

Nose and tastes are at first watery and grainy, and then cut in with a huge dollop of sweetness. The sugar seems very artificial and quite chemical in its nature. The lack of body continually repeats itself.

12 oz single. At first glance, from the general appearance and more obviously from the name, it seemed to me as though this was going to be some huge, American DIPA that would be a real plate abuser. On closer inspection it reveals that the beer is not supposed to be that at all, and it's just a swell since it did not appear especially hoppy at all. In fact, the name was somewhat ironic in both the respect that it was not notably hoppy OR delicious!
Anyway - the pour is a hazy, deep orange with a nice white head that looks pretty good. if the truth be told, the best aspect of the beer is to be found by simply looking at it, the rest is somewhat downhill from there.
A few notes of bitterness are backed up by a weakish malt base and a lack luster mouthfeel. Somewhat watery I thought, and the beer lacked much depth or presence. Grainy alcohol comes through a bit amongst the sweetness, but overall there's nothing of any substance to report.
Finish leaves me wanting something else, as the tastes fade in an alarming manner. Compare this to a run of the mill American Pale like Sierra Nevada's and it fares even worse."

The nose here is quite weak, and the tastes follow suit. Sure there are chocolate notes and some bitterness amongst those roasted malts, but the overall package feels quite weak to me. This of course may be a function of age, but it ought to be able to stand up to some cellaring - maybe not. Some dark chocolate powder (cocoa), but it feels washed out and lacks maltiness. Weak.

Nose and tastes deliver some substantial, malts that are nicely complimented with a decent splash of bitterness. The hop profile is noticeable and definitely brings a presence that is unusual for the style, AND gives more punch than a beer with this kind of ABV would be expected to deliver.
The bitterness lingers longer than i would think it would as well, and with it comes a satisfying feeling of alertness. This beer is one to be reckoned with on a number of levels and I like it very much. A little soap in there too.

Nose and tastes are SUBTLE! Imagine that! Very light fruits with some subtle, sweeter fruits like peaches, but a healthy dose of sweetened grapefruit giving the true IPA moniker. Very easy to drink, and a beautifully balanced IPA that will not assault your taste buds, rather it will caress them.
Gentle, appropriate carbonation, and despite the poor pour, a good amount of lace on the glass. Finish gives a kiss of more bitterness and a lingering fruity feel. Some hoppy burps, too.

For a beer that has a Czech Pils moniker, it has a heck of a lot of adjunct lager character!
Head retention is pretty weak and the beer delivers a nose that is chocked full of vegetal sweetness.
The aroma characteristics are somewhat 'bothersomely' repeated in the tastes and frankly they do not improve much. The nagging sweetness replaces what should be a dry, clean, bitter Saaz bite in the finish, and the beer generally under performs horribly for the style, and frankly doesn't do any more than just that.

Pour is an encouraging, reddish brown affair with some nice clarity and good, attractive highlights when the light catches it correctly. The head is a little small, quite poorly retained and lacks much lace, so the good work provided by the color is unfortunately undone almost immediately. Shame.
The carbonation seems a touch low.
A malty beer with fairly simple caramel and sweet characteristics without getting complicated. However, it does seem really light in many important areas including tastes depth, nose and satisfaction/mouthfeel. I was initially encouraged by the sensible ABV, and I do like a good bock, but this seemed to lack depth and the German yeast components that are essential to such a beer.
Has the potential to be good, but ultimately it misses on most fronts. Disappointed, as I really wanted (and tried) to like this much more. As far as Minhas goes this is NOT their worst effort by some distance, but in the end it's still pretty poor."

To be fair the beer does pour with a Pilsener appearance in terms of color, carbonation and clarity, but the head is woeful and the lace non-existent.
The tastes and nose are INCREDIBLY sweet, even for my sweet tooth and obviously horribly out of place in a Pils. The Germans would be horrified by this I feel. It's got macro adjunct written all over it - straw colored, vegetal, corny tastes mingle amongst the overpowering sugar rush. Pretty much undrinkable in the final analysis.

Pour offers a strangely red tinge to the beer with plenty of white head. The color goes beyond amber and to another level. 
Nose offers little, but the tastes do deliver a touch more that I was expecting. Some light acidity on the malts and a light dry character that no-one is calling 'hoppy', but on the other hand does deliver a certain non-sweet note.

Rye beers (of any description) are not really my thing so I approach this with a degree of trepidation. 
the beer pours as a totally clear, golden straw color with a small, white head. Carbonation is decent and leaves a touch of lace.
With the combo of pale malts and, hops and rye, the beer does deliver a clean-cut edge with a degree of bitterness up front. However, this beer is not really deep. Finish is short and dry (good), but lacks much presence. The rye bitterness builds a bit and is an interesting alternative to a noble hop bitterness but never fully replicates it,
A little graininess to it, and a beer that although not sweet per se, seems sweeter than it should be for the type of brew that it is.
No complaints here since the beer delivers a refreshing experience, but in no way is this a beer that is memorable or lingers on the palate. OK, I suppose, but still leaves me saying, ""ho hum"" a bit. Wouldn't turn down a few in the height f summer, but never a beer that I would seek out again."

Some light, peppery spice on the aroma and tastes that also lend a degree of bitterness. Sharp and clean, the beer gives away its sharp roots with a combination of dry, stinging bitterness. This is by no means the harshest of the style I have had, not does it deliver the real sting of solid Saaz (or other noble) 'bite', but it definitely captures the genre quite nicely.

Dark copper, garnet colored body with good clarity and a small, off-white head. In the Chimay chalice the beer leaves some decent lace and a thin, creamy spotty head on the surface of the beer.
The nose is where things get interesting to say the least. There is some sweetness that I was expecting, but there is also a dose of some hop character. 
The tastes are also pretty odd. There's a lot of sweetness, but not really a lot of fruit character or Belgian yeast notes. The lack of yeast is areal disappointment. Plenty of syrupy alcohol and again, a strange, out of place hoppiness. This beer drinks like a HUGELY sweet IPA. It's extremely odd. There's also an odd smokiness to the beer, too.
Don't come here looking for a typical BSDA, this isn't it, rather it's a strange combination of sweetness and a thinnish IPA with a bit of smoke in the mix.
ODD, and not to my liking really and unrecognizable in the style."

I'm immediately put on the defensive by the idea of a 'Black Saison'; as a traditionalist and a person that really loves a great Saison this doesn't really fill me with a lot of inspiration or hope. 
Jet black body with a small, creamy head.
Some nice lemony, citrus notes in the nose, and a simple replication in the tastes. Some nice, sharp orange peel and a few light spices and white pepper in there too. Very, very minimal roastiness (which I am glad about), but then again why use the dark malts?? There's a decent dose of bitterness, but it's based in saison tartness and a light spicy nature rather than a roasted element. I don't get much rye either, which for me is also a good thing.
A smooth creaminess in the mouth comes with the fine bubbles.
Although I enjoyed the beer somewhat, I really don't see the point of use use of the dark malts. They really don't bring a significant roast character, and since they don't do that, why not just brew the beer with a more traditional grain bill? It comes across as gimmicky, i.e. a stunt to make something 'different' - that bothers me a little."

Pour is a nice looking one, with all the requisite attributes for the style, plus some really nice alcohol legs. Head and lace are not amazing, but solid.
Nose is pretty strong, but mainly in alcohol and little else. Usually that's not a good sign but this particular aroma sits OK with me.
Very light in the mouth which adds to the drinkability. The beer is a collection of maltiness wrapped inside more alcohol. Obviously some roastiness but very little harsh bitterness. There are a few notes of various chocolates (both dark & light), and the beer comes together rather well.
Quite an easy drinker and light in the mouthfeel, but the beer does give a very significant alcohol taste and delivery.k"

Delighted to get it for that kind of money since there seems to have been a very mixed reception for this beer.
Poured into the champagne flute, the appearance lives up the style with a hazed, darker than one might expect, peachy, golden body and a hugely effervescent head.
The nose offers a dry, acidic alcohol aroma that is promising.
The tastes on the other hand are nowhere near as dry as I was expecting, and give (in parts) quite a lot of sweetness and apple taste. The beer also comes across with quite a heavy handed syrupy feel and is nowhere near as dry as I was expecting or hoping. In fact, the beer is really quite viscous and not easy to drink.
A beer in this style would need to be WAY drier, crisper, lighter and less sweet if I were to go near it again. I didn't dislike it as such, but this beer is far too laborious for the style and couple with the alcohol is quite a big effort.
Not an easy beer, and I've had many better in the style and it seems as though these two brewers ought to have come up with a better beer. At $16.99 I wasn't happy with the price, at a higher price point I would have been increasingly annoyed."

A lovely, deep brown color with some decent head and retention. Not much lace, but still looks nice. Decent depth on the color too with some nice red hues coming through.

A nice, smooth nuttiness permeates the whole experience and leaves that lingering malty character that one really wants with a brown ale. 

Carbonation does feel a little prickly which detracts from a creaminess that I usually need in a brown ale, but it's not too off-putting. 

ABV could drop another % point or so too, but again not much to concern me here.

Tasty, and delighted to get a 'proper' bottle this time. Scores adjusted.

Original scores: 4.0, 3.5, 2.0, 3.5, 2.5

12 oz single, thanks to Steve for the chance to try this one.

Pours with a decent brown body and a head that receded quite quickly but did leave some lace. 

A slightly acidic note comes off the beer which has me thinking CCB infection again - is it my imagination? The nose suggests a much bigger nutty note than the taste delivers, and once again an acidity comes through to spoil the malty experience that such a brown ale should deliver.

I have no idea if this was one of the many infected batches of beer from CCB, but it seems oddly acidic to me and doesn't stack up well as a brown ale for me. Another CCB disappointment, I'm getting a little tired of this.

Pour is a dark brown with blackish, red highlights and a resplendent, high, mocha colored frothy head. Head retention and lace are both very good.
An extremely solid, malty nose suggests depth, and a lot of it.
Tastes don't quite deliver what the nose suggested, but still give a hearty malt based beer with some alcohol and a decent dose of bitterness. A tiny amount of oxidized, sweet liquor character that I was not expecting. Finish has more malts and the beer feels quite filling and expansive.
This is a beer that whilst although not heavy, certainly has some depth and delivers a malty experience that others in the style shy away from. Sort of a cross between a Wee Heavy and an American Strong, the beer is much more subtle than some American versions and brings plenty of malt to the table.
Interesting."

Hazy, butterscotch orange pour with a splendid head. The head is very ice-cream like, and threatens to be almost solid. Thick white density with retention to match. Great looking beer.
Nose gives a characteristic musty, rye note which is carried into the taste. The tastes give quite a bitter, peppery note that lacks the charm or fruitiness of a beer like a Saison, or the sweetness of a Tripel, two styles that also offer some pepper. This seems more black pepper than white pepper.
Not a style I care for a lot, but this did look fantastic and offered a pretty nice drink, but the musty character lingers a little and it's what turns me away from these beers a bit."

Pour gives a lovely black color (in poor light), but a more traditional brown based beer in better light. The head is tight, and mocha in color with a nice amount of retention and lace considering the ABV.
The worry with the ABV of 9% is that the solvent alcohol may begin to take over the beer and rob it of its normal style characteristics. Fortunately it doesn't, and the beer delivers all of the requisite banana, bubblegum and alcohol sweetness that one would expect. Lots of repeated waves of estery, fruitiness and a solid warmth from the alcohol in the finish.
All in all nicely put together, and the beer drinks very well.

Pour is a slightly reddish brown, with some good clarity, a smallish head that is not retained all that well and does not really give much lace.
The nose and tastes combine to yield a very nice malty, alcohol flavor that is compact and fairly short without fuss. The beer is pretty light with a straightforward approach that delivers a bready finish and some simplicity and depth that is uncommon. Robust, perhaps a little nutty and definitely yeasty, the alcohol pops in for a brief appearance in the final flourish too.
Nice beer in the style which pleases me but may be a little too simple for some."

750 mL capped bottle. Not really sure what a Oatmeal, Rye, India Brown Ale is, but...
Opening produces a HUGE gusher - not a trivial amount of beer lost, in fact around one third of the total contents are lost on the kitchen counter. Makes me think 'infection' or a best 'over-carbonated', we'll see.
The pour gives a frankly UGLY, chocolate brown color to the body that looks like viscous med - totally opaque. The head is obviously very good, well retained, a coffee-color and gives some nice lace. In that respect the beer looks good, but the color is just pain UGLY. An immediate paradox in the appearance.
The nose gives an acidic twang and some blue cheese. This makes me think Brett or infection.
The tastes reflect the nose and offer an acidic, light, blue cheese note and not much else. Funk is all over the place and the sour note persists through the beer, or at least the amount I can get down before drain pouring the rest of the bottle.

Tastes are in line for the style and combine a decent hop and malt balance with the requisite dry finish. Aftertaste lingers to give some more residual hoppiness which is appropriate.

The bottle has silver foil on the 22 oz neck. An aggressive pour produces a slightly hazed, mid-orange body and gives a lovely, dense, creamy white head. Looks a little like a latte floating on top of the beer.
Nose has a little soapiness (which I like), but it never gets strong. I would not have guessed that this beer was based upon Denver Pale Ale, but the label confirms.
The tastes are essentially a residual sweet, lightly woody, viscous sugary affair with some hop resin residuals as well. The alcohol is very well hidden and the sweetness (somewhat surprisingly) never gets very large. The beer walks a strange line between hops and sugar and I suppose works, but it's a real sipper and nothing that I would ever want more than one of, every 12 months or so. A fairly decent dose of vanilla, too.

Nose and tastes are largely devoid of any character with a slight, sweet grain note and perhaps a little crisp citrus.

The initial taste blast is a little unexpected and seems quite bitter and hoppy. I wasn't expecting this a all considering the style and it is really noticeable. I didn't like that jolt very much, but on the plus side as soon as it came, it faded and the middle and back end of the beer behaved in a much more standard fashion.

Went to an Atlanta curry house and sw it on the menu, but they were out. A few days later i picked up this gold foiled, 650 mL bottle at Total Wine, Perimeter, Atlanta, GA, USA for $2.49 (I think). 
There really is very little to report her in terms of the appearance (golden clarity, initially high carbonation, frothy head, small amount of lace and retention), nose (largely bland but with a grainy sweetness), taste (INCREDIBLY sweet, even by the standards normally associated with such things), or the drinkability (OK for what it is and it could wash down a hot curry), but for me the beer has a certain, strange charm. Perhaps it's the curry association, maybe the presentation, or perhaps even the marketing, but this is a beer that I enjoyed drinking and would re-visit.
If you cannot stand the sweetness I wouldn't be surprised, and to be fair I am not exactly recommending this, but for me it was a decent example of something that I was expecting little from."

For an American IPA the nose is really quite malty. It reminds me a little of a Sam Oktoberfest. Quite a shock.
Tastes are also strangely sweet and malt based with what comes across as a layering effect of bitterness from the hops. Middle, back end and finish combine to give quite a coinage metal effect and a short, sharp grapefruit ending.
I quite like this beer, and definitely enjoyed more than I though that I might. It delivers a very strong malt base behind the metallic and clean hop tastes, and a ll in all delivers a pretty satisfying bitterness. Some may be disappointed with the lighter touch that this American IPA delivers, but I on the other hand think it combines some decent, Nobel bite along with some simplicity.

This is the third in the series for me, and I had pretty poor experiences with the Stone and Victory versions (the Victory was especially awful), so my hopes are low for this one. Having said that, this kind of things is something that DFH is likely to pull off better than the other two breweries involved so there is more hope.
Nice golden pour, with some attractive cloudiness that is appropriate for the style. Impressive, fluffy and pillow like head.
Nose and tastes do have a floral and herbal element, but it is nowhere near as aggressive and overwhelming as the other Saison Du Buff's. Quite a lot of lemongrass, and a full, fluffy mouthfeel. Not a great deal of complexity here in as much as it does not deliver any white pepper or any subtle fruit, phenol or ester notes, but it does end with a touch of spicy bitterness that lingers a little.
Much more in a classic Saison style than the other two 'Buff's' and in that respect I like it a lot more, and it sits better with me. best of the three by a LONG distance, and frankly that should not really surprise us given that DFH is a brewery that handles this type of beer better than Stone and Victory."

Pour was a dark brown affair that was presented with far too little head. This was a pouring issue rather than a beer issue - a common problem when drinking at Taco Mac.
The beer was also too cold, which had an influence on the nose. With time, the beer did release its aroma and when they came it was worth the wait. Some decent, light, understated smoke.
Tastes were are very simple smoke, with some decent malt to back it up. the beer was pretty straightforward and simple, which for me is becoming both a signature trait and a great strength for Glenn and Jailhouse. If you want over the top, complicated nonsense then look elsewhere. If you want well made beer with a simplicity that yells 'quality' then Jailhouse is a brewery that will work for you.
Glenn has a commitment to a house style and to beer that has simplicity but solidly made. This is an interesting diversion which proves he has the capacity to step outside those parameters and do some interesting things. Jailhouse is truly a player to watch."

Nose has some alcohol, but frankly not a huge amount of hop presence when considering the nature of the beast.
The tastes are similarly sweet and slick as opposed to very hoppy. There's a little hop burn in the chest with the alcohol, but it doesn't tear at the palate in a massively aggressive manner. The slick mouthfeel is appropriate and to be expected when considering the style and the alcohol content.
There is a decent amount of solvent in the very back end, finish and aftertaste which takes a little away from the overall experience for me, but the beer never really delivers what I would call a huge hop battering. Some metal in the aftertaste too.

The beer is quite bitter - with a metallic twang. I'm not sure that oaking an IPA is a wise move, and the combination seems to create a very, very bitter affair with all the bad aspects of unrefined grapefruit and none of the good. A tiny vanilla note upfront is almost immediately overwhelmed. The bitterness does not have much charm, and it creates a burning nastiness that lingers for some time.

Alcohol taste lingers in the finish.
Given the lack of carbonation, the beer is actually incredibly drinkable. I cannot imagine how much I would like this if it were even mildly carbonated. Essentially it's a poor mans Utopias.
I suppose that this is a ""beer"" that essentially can do without the carbonation, since its lack converts it to a sherry, i.e. a beer much like Utopias, but the annoying thing is that I don't suppose LA started out with the intention of producing a totally uncarbonated beer - did they?"

It's fine, it acts as a decent thirst quencher. Light grain notes in the aroma and a very, very mildly acidic finish complete the picture.
For me, this style is really heavily dependent on two factors. Freshness and weather context. In the middle of a hot summer with the beer coming straight out of the tank, one could really get to love many American Pale Wheat's. Under less favorable circumstances of freshness and temperature, bees in this style can appear watery and bland."

Very ordinary in the mouth, the beer has a few wheat characteristics but ultimately fails to deliever in any significant manner. Perhaps a few citrus, lemon hnts of acidity but overalll disappointing.

Pour is a rather attractive golden color with some nice clarity. Head is tall, frothy and sticky. Retention is average, wish it was better to complete the visual package.
Nose is a typical, fruity hop bomb with some alcohol and largely in line for the style. If this were a blind tasting I don't think I would pick up any smoke at all, but knowing that there is some present the beer does reveal a hint - no more, but enough to let me know what's going on.
Unsurprisingly this is a big beer with a good smattering of typical grapefruit and peach fruit and a harsh ending. The finish is combination of quite jarring ethanol and hop resins.
There is a hint of smoke that runs throughout the beer and although it is slightly more noticeable in the tastes than the nose, I remain unconvinced that I would detect it blind. I suspect that I would say that the beer had a spiciness to it which I think can be attributed to the smoke, but without knowing that I might just say that it was 'peppery'.
The mouthfeel is a bit slick, but that's appropriate considering ABV and style.
The beer works well, BUT strangely I find myself craving more smoke! It's tasty but would be even better with more of the charred notes. Like most beers of its type it's going to work best with food.
The third and fourth beers in the theater series have proved to be much better than the first two, and have even done enough to restore a little faith in Terrapin. As ever with this series, value is lacking even when considering the cause."

A hazy orange pour, a sticky white head but a few yeast particles/floaties that I could do without. When the particles settle at the bottom of the glass we see some medium carbonation. The head is nicely retained and the stickiness is always a good sign for a beer like this.
Nose has plenty of light hops - nothing amazing, but nevertheless ""present"". A *slight* green hop cone note in the nose as well.
Tastes are those of a well tempered, American IPA. By that I mean there is plenty of hop bitterness, but the malt backbone hols it together well. A somewhat paradoxically fruity taste up front, followed by a dry finish. Interesting combination.
The finish is quite short, has a little metal and reiterates the dry character. Alcohol doesn't seem like it is almost 7%.
Pretty good example of the style, and a beer that I enjoyed more than I though that I might. Taken as a package, this is a beer that one could easily have on hand on a regular basis as a solid staple. Nothing earth shattering, but pretty solid."

Label is slightly different to the one in the BA db where the words Pilsner Beer have simply become ""Pilsner"". Notched as being bottle in Wk 1, May but no year given, assuming 2010.
The pour yields a beer that has a pilsner color (perhaps it's a little more 'yellow'), but unfortunately it comes with a slight haze that substantially detracts from the clarity. Not really what I'm looking for here, and it upsets the balance of the look. In addition the carbonation seems a little low to me, and the head and lace could both be much better.
Nose and tastes are both very disappointing. They add up to what is simply a non-offensive macro, adjunct lager and not much else. There's no Saaz or Noble bitterness, and these is a lack of a clean edge. With those attributes missing, a beer that is supposed to be a genuine pilsner can drop off very quickly.

No Belgian yeast character to speak of. The beer is quite 'snappy' with some really clean lines and some fairly well defined fruit notes. Light zing in the finish and a crisp drink.
Not bad at all. A simple beer which is a plus for me, a sensible (if not exactly low) ABV, combine to produce a tasty, balanced beer that is very drinkable. Light touch with some malt presence too.

A hazy, orange copper color body with better head and lace that I was expecting for a beer of its size.
Aroma and initial tastes are excruciatingly sweet, and it's a sweetness that lacks the charm of an English Barleywine and comes charging at you with clumsiness.
The beer is a convoluted and confusing array of alcohol, sugar, malt and tastes that seem to be esters in their profile but are difficult to pin down.

The alcohol in the nose seems a little strong and it has me a bit concerned for the tastes. In reality it doesn't manifest itself quite as aggressively as the aroma would suggest, but it is still a prominent feature.
At first I didn't think that this was going to be a very hoppy stout, but as the glass and bottle progressed it seemed to build in hop bitterness. A underlying very slight lactose note seemed to added to the sour/bitter elements and the beer got quite sharp.
Light roastiness runs across the middle of the palate and adds to the dry, bitter character.
Quite surprised at how hoppy this stout was. and that is generally not to my liking. I think this would do better in the American Double Stout category."

The label suggests that this beer is a cross between a Scotch Ale and a Porter. I'm not sure what that means, but in the final analysis the beer drinks largely like an American Porter to me.
""American"" in the manner that the hops are higher than the original English version, and the beer has a less creamy texture and finishes drier. No Scotch Ale character for me.
Dark brown pour with a few reddish highlights. Head is good and leaves some decent lace.
Nose has some malts but is fairly neutral. A few darker grains,
A little thin, lacks a creamy texture. Dry finish with a touch of bitterness and light prickle on the carbonation.
Not much going on here, but the beer is non-offensive. Unfortunately it is also non-memorable as well. Sort of a neutral beer for me."

Pour is a dark brown, muddy affair with a huge, well retained coffee colored, ice-cream styled foam that eventually falls away to give a light foam.
Nose gives a fairly predictable sherry like note, but to be honest it comes with a little oxidative, mustiness that takes the edge of a little.
The tastes do something similar. A sweet, very light Madeira note dominates, but again a slightly oxidized, alcohol element cuts across the finish. there is even a noticeable last minute dash of acidity that confirms the oxidation. Not troublesome, more surprising.
The finish introduces the best part of the beer for me. I get some distinct pepper amongst the sherry and oxidized elements and it works well. Very interesting, very good but if I'm honest it did not live up to the (massive) hype,"

Murky. mid-brown/orange pour that creates some head but not much lace.
Nose offers a malty fruit base that adds a little bitterness that is reminiscent of grapefruit, but to be honest it's not a grapefruit taste that one normally associates with a high hop profile.
Similar things happen in the taste, where the slightly bitter grapefruit sits on the fruity end of the spectrum rather than the hop end of the scale.
As the paragraphs above would suggest, the beer is really quite fruity and only has a a hint of bitterness in the finish. Winter Warmer? I dunno, this seem quite malty and English in its taste and doesn't deliver any spice notes at all.

Jolly Pumpkin is a frustrating brewery to me - more of that later. 
The pour produces a burnt orange hue with a small head that produces some nice, white lace. Looks good.
The nose and tastes are well,...Jolly Pumpkin! Light acidity, strong apple notes, plenty of cider character and the light funk and mild Brett character. They meld quite nicely together and the beer offers a sharp, refreshing and slightly ethanoic acid finish. Tasty, satisfying, but...
...ZERO, and I mean ZERO (as in totally devoid) of any pumpkin character, and that's central to my problem with JP beers in general.
The second half of the bottle produces a lot of nasty looking coagulated protein or sediment.
Frankly, being experienced with J beers I wasn't expecting a ""Pumpkin beer"", nor was I expecting anything other than the cider character than I got, so my question is WHY call the beer a pumpkin beer? Why not take the Fantôme route, and call ALL the beers that they make, some version of a Saison/Wild/Farmhouse??

A couple of inches of snow in Atlanta, another half inch of ice on top and a snow day gives me an unexpected opportunity to crack this one - not much else to do!
Beer pours essentially a jet black pour with perhaps some very dark brown colors at the extremities. A thin, tan head that recede to give a white color around the glass. 
The nose is strong even when the beer is cool, but becomes potent as it warms. The liquor and alcohol aromas are increasingly strong, and really sharp in the nose from several inches away, and noticeable from several feet! This concerned me a bit, since I was thinking that if this was going to manifest itself in the taste then I wasn't going to be too happy.
The tastes DO reflect the nose, but they are surprisingly mellow when considering the volatiles that are escaping the DFH signature glass. With over a year on this beer, there is a pretty large element of sweetness that stands up to the aggressive liquor notes and the alcohol. Make no mistake, this beer is still a big beast, but there is a tamed element to it, despite the warm that builds in the chest on the way down, and the light solvent touch that evaporates in the mouth as the beer is consumed.
I was very wary of this before I opened it as I typically don't care for the bourbon notes too much, but there is a whole bunch of other notes that combine to produce a great package; oak, a little smoke, vanilla, dark plums and molasses and rum. The alcohol stings and gives a touch of pepper as well. These tastes meld well with the bourbon elements to produce a full on assault that is surprisingly drinkable.
Tasty and better than I was expecting and certainly more drinkable."

Light , golden orange body with an initially, big rocky head that leaves some nice sticky lace. Slight haze/cloudiness. 
Nose and tastes are typically English in terms of the biscuity malts and the relatively restrained hop profile. I think that this is a slightly older bottle, so it may be that these attributes are a function of some time, and earlier on this beer was more ""American"" in its feel.
Light metal in the finish, but this adds to the clean feel associated with the beer. Some light peach and other soft fruits cut across the back end to end a sweetness to the beer. Surprisingly fruity actually!
Seems a touch thin in the mouth to metal.

A clouded, ""orangey"", copper colored pour with some scant white head but a lack of much presence or lace.
A somewhat attractive blueberry based fruit aroma comes off the beer, even when quite cold. This nose intensifies as the beer warms as the volatiles escape.
Tastes are unfortunately less attractive than the nose would suggest, but in a surprising way. Sometimes, beers like this a criticized for their ""imitation"" fruit flavors but that's not the problem here. In fact I would describe the blueberries are quite ""natural tasting"", however the beer is oddly sweet with a combination of sugar notes and high, solvent alcohol taste that makes it rather difficult to drink. It's a bit sickly sweet in its taste, and this is coming from someone that usually loves sweet beers. The combination does not meld very well together for me, and last third of the bottle is not consumed.
The beer ends up being too heavy, and I am looking for a brew with MUCH cleaner lines if I am picking up a fruit based beer. Here is seems like there is an unlikely combination of high sugar levels with excess alcohol! Seems odd, I know but whatever it is, and however it was achieved, it does not drink easily.
I am NOT against fruit beer in general, it just seems as though this one is not coming together very well."

Interesting. I actually really like the presentation. The clear glass with the dark contents look appealing and interesting to me, and frankly whilst completely understanding and not disputing the chemistry, I feel that the number of problems with skunking are generally overblown a little. Anyway....
...a solid, chocolate brown colored pour with some great looking clarity. Carbonation is OK, but I wish that it provided a better head and some increased retention. If we could get that up a little this would be a really nice looking beer indeed.
Malty notes dominate (obviously) but with them becomes a touch of musty cardboard. Something similar comes in the tastes too, and ultimately I feel that this beer is one the verge of being quite tasty, but ultimately doesn't really cut it. There is a distinct German yeast note in there along with some sweet, malt based sugars, and in all all it's not bad at all.
Perhaps a touch thin, and whatever is needed to increase the body, the head retention and give the beer a little more depth of flavor, needs to be added to take this one over the top."

Pour is a rich, clouded, honey orange hue with an inordinate number of yest floaties. The combination of the color, floaties and general muddy appearance does nothing for the beer and frankly makes it appear somewhat ""soup-like"". This is not a good sign in my book. Head is strong though, and leaves lots of sticky lace.
Nose and tastes both give similarly muddled impressions. Hop bitterness and edge is lacking, and it is replaced by a large, unwieldy malt presence that manifests itself as unattenuated sugar. Strange. the beer lacks a clean edge in many respects, and it comes across as a ""kitchen sink"" beer. This type of concoction is a manifestation of all that's bad about contemporary, American brewing. The idea that somehow more of everything makes a beer, ""better"".
It's a soupy, unpleasant mess with hardly any redeeming features. A lot of stuff, poorly managed and thrown together. Alcohol is burning and aggressive to boot. the sugar and alcohol make it slick in the mouth.
Frankly, I think it is a poorly brewed beer."

Not sure about this from the get-go. Is this a filtered Wit? Seems odd to say the least. The beer is golden with a small head but almost has zero cloudiness in the glass. Makes me feel odd, a bit like the disconnect between the appearance and taste that one finds in the American-style India Black Ales.
Smell offers some light lemon and that peculiar sinus clearing carbonation that can sometimes exist in a beer.
Lemon notes are less prominent in the tastes than the nose would suggest but still offers a decent blast of citrus. the carbonation is quite high and deliver some prickly mouthfeel elements. Finish is short and clean with a snappy, quick bitterness.
This is a drinkable beer, but as for being a typical Wit I would say no. All the way from the appearance through the lack of yeast/wheat character and the lack of any significant orange or coriander notes, I would say it is this lacks many of those attributes. It's OK, unoffensive and fairly simple, but it's not a beer that you would point to as being typical."

Slightly hazed, orange gold body with a soapy looking, one finger head. Head is light and frothy in appearance. Lace is minimal.
Carbonation seems a little low.
Tastes are fairly straightforward grains with a hint of bitterness in the back end. Light soapy tastes compliment the bitterness to yield a drier than expected finish.
Surprisingly I get a yew lemon notes in the beer which add to its lightness and make it pretty drinkable. Light lemon persists all the way through to the finish and the aftertaste.

Crystal clear, light golden clarity with an impressive, rocky, pillow-like head, great carbonation and some super lace. Very good looking indeed.
A really clean, light grainy nose with a dash of white pepper. Again, impressive for the style.
Clean body with the requisite character; clean lines, slight bitterness (in a Saaz/Noble type manner) and a short ending. Although good, perhaps paradoxically the tastes are the weakest part of the beer. I would like the bitterness to be a little more prominent.
Without question the best beer that Terrapin has put out amongst this muddled, confused and somewhat frantic recent series of side projects and other, ""special"" releases. Having said that, and despite the fact that I am very happy to pay a premium price for ANY premium beer (lower ABV ones included), the value is debatable even considering the cause."

Very strong bread nose with plenty of sweetness.
Tastes are similar to the nose in as much as we get a big blast of malt and plenty of biscuity character. There is (somewhat disappointingly) quite a lot of solvent alcohol taste, too. The sweetness (which is fairly intense), does temper the alcohol some, but the overall package feels STRONGLY ""American"" in a s much as it is pretty much devoid of much subtlety.
The English malt/biscuit character is there, however the beer stomps all over the simplicity of that. When the simple notes are lost, it seems a bit like the point of this beer is left behind.

The beer pours with a mid-brown, clouded body and a healthy, light tan head. Some decent lace considering the ABV.
The nose is not especially strong, even on warming. It reveals a little malty sugar but not much else.
The tastes are pretty interesting. Very, very well balanced slightly bitter malts, with virtually no hint of the alcohol. There is some simple sweetness up front, but this gives way to yield an extremely mild, light and gentle touch of hops - just a kiss.
The finish is very short and clean.
This is a very atypical Rogue beer, but the best that I've had (along with Maierfest) in recent years.
The price is the real issue here, and if you consider it alone this beer is dreadful value, however it IS a really nice beer. Very mild, subtle and surprisingly so for a Rogue beer. Drinkable, tasty and well-balanced. The latter not really a trait of Rogue beers!"

It's the kind of beer that I would be absolutely delighted to be able to produce in my garage, but at the same time also pretty disappointed if I couldn't! What I mean by that is that the beer doesn't have any flaws as such, but is truly a pretty mediocre effort for a professional outfit."

Impressive, dark chestnut brown color with a really creamy, espresso type head that has nice retention and some very creamy, coating lace. Looks like the proverbial dark chocolate milkshake.
Plenty of malty, bready alcohol in the nose.
Creamy mouthfeel with a hint of acidity and perhaps even a touch of lactose character. The tastes do not give much in the way of nuttiness until the finish where there is a hint of hazelnut and a bitterness that one would associate with the outer skin of a Brazil nut. Drink more like a milk stout to me, and even though the label describes this as a ""Northern English Brown Ale"", if you took this to a working mens club in Salford I think you might get a Kirby Kiss for your trouble. Way too much alcohol to even be considered as ""English"" anything IMO! As it warms the lactose note increases, and I KNOW this is not categorized as a Milk Stout!
Its full mouthfeel and creaminess are both the strength of this beer and its downfall. Nice, but just too much to ever make it really drinkable for me."

I was expecting a typical, malty experience and the beer did deliver it, but to be honest it felt a touch on the light side to me. Light caramel and toffee grains interact with the bitterness to produce a beer hat has a LOT of bready character. No problem there, but some depth is missing for me. The beer remains extraordinary drinkable though, and within a few minutes the bottle has disappeared.
Easy drinking, but somehow leaves me wanting a little more malt depth. The brew seems a tad on the light side (and I'm NOT talking about the alcohol) rather there is a mouthfeel that leaves me slightly dissatisfied."

Some Belgian yeast notes in the nose and tastes, but also a fair amount of hop character that I wasn't really expecting. The hops, although fairly muted and reserved, still sing out too much for the style for me, and frankly don't belong there, even in the relatively muted manner that they appear. Caramel malts are present but to be honest they get a little overwhelmed in terms of the whole package.
Alcohol is fairly present too, and this comes across as quite strong beer.

Now I'm confused. Bought six bottles of this because I was sure I would like it, and after sharing bottle #1 I felt REALLY good about my purchase, however as I drink bottle #2 I feel less confident than I did a few weeks ago.
I had this for the first time about three weeks ago and absolutely loved it. Now I try it for the second time and I feel a little less enamored with it, but above all there seems to be a slight carbonation issue!
The beer pours with a lightly, chill-hazed brown-garnet pour. As I say, on this occasion the beer is poorly carbonated and lacks life. There is a little carbonation at first, but by the time the beer has sat in the glass for about ten minutes, it's completely flat. Disappointing, and not something that I experienced when I drank it three weeks ago.
Nose and tastes deliver plenty of honey, sugared alcohol and some light fruit. Good depth on the Belgian yest and fruit elements and the brew gives some nice fig and plum character. The beer finishes with a dry note that reminds one of the oak element, and a touch more drying ethanol. Aftertaste lingers and reinforces the dry character with some evaporating alcohol.
Definitely some woody, dry fruit in there too.
Interesting beer and I'm a little conflicted here. The carbonation worries me a bit, and it's confusing since I don't recall it being low a couple of weeks ago!?"

Obviously this beer is quite old, and probably at an age way beyond what the brewer originally intended so the review should be viewed in that context.
Corked & Caged affair that opens with a pretty small pop and a touch of gun smoke. 
The pour is a fairly bright orange color, with a still body an a disappointing lack of carbonation/head/lace. I suppose that given the age of the beer that the carbonation situation should not be that surprising, but nevertheless it's a bit of a shame. The color is especially striking. 
The nose reveals a sugary sweetness and not a lot else. 
The body is a little cleaner than the sweetness in the nose would suggest. No cloying notes (that I was a little concerned about). 
In terms of taste, to be honest the beer isn't as good as I was expecting, but equally it seems a little unfair of me to expect that a beer this old would still perform as well as originally intended. Having said that, at 10% there might be a small degree of expectation that things would have held up OK. Any spices that were there originally have largely disappeared and there is a degree of mild oxidation. With the oxidation comes a very, very light touch of sherry (good), but also of course of touch of cardboard (bad). That's something that you have to live with when you are dealing with older beers.
In the very back end there is some light alcohol notes.
Despite the condition of the beer, it's still tasty and pretty drinkable I just wish that had drunk this beer when it had first come out - my bet is that this was amazing at the outset. One thing to note, age means that this beer drinks nothing like a Witbier now - the degree to which it did originally is unknown to me, so perhaps there has not been much change there at all, or maybe there has been a huge change.
Strangely (or perhaps NOT strangely at ALL) a very similar reaction to this beer as my reaction to Allagash 11th."

Pour is a superb looking, garnet color with some tremendous clarity. Head is small, leaves little lace but is a pleasing tea hue. Attractive.
Nose has a rich, sugary, molasses light liquor note that is replicated in the taste t a n extent, but the beer feels a little thinner than the nose suggests.
The tastes offer a touch more alcohol than the nose, plus some mild hop character.
This beer reminds me a lot of Fuller's Vintage Ale, except it seems to have a little less body, is a little less rich, has bit more alcohol and more hop notes! Sounds like a lot of differences, but when taken together it DOES remind me of the ""great one"". The beer drinks much more like an English beer (with notes of English Barleywines and English Old Ales).
There's a noticeable vinous character (obviously) from the Pinot Noir, and it builds as the beer warms. The vinous character is warming in the chest too, and it gives a really pleasant overall feel to the beer. 
Jubel 2010 is what I imagine a beer like Stone's Arrogant Bastard would be, if it went to live in England for a couple of years, learned some manners and etiquette and then came back to the USA to show-off it's more refined training!

This beer has been on my Wants list for quite some time, and having passed on it at least once in the store, I wondered if I would get the chance - many thanks, Mike. Bottled in July of 2009, this is described as being best before 2019.
Expensive looking in as much as the beer comes with a heavy gold foil, a neck label stating that this is bottle #1971 out of 7800 all in a heavy, green glass, 750 mL container. Surprisingly comes with one of those cheap, plastic sparkling wine ""corks"" which somewhat takes the edge off the presentation. Opens with a disappointing lack of carbonation.
The beer pours a pretty lifeless, somewhat drab, murky light brown color with very little head or lace. Nose has a musty, ""old"" note about it with a whiff of liquor.
The tastes are complicated with all kinds of elements pushing their way around. There is a diacetyl butter note, some butterscotch a strange, apple/fruit like acidity, a cheap lemon shandy note and finally some whisky based alcohol. The lemon notes pushes through to the greatest extent in the end, and the beer drinks something like an English lemonade shandy with a dash of whisky added.
It's odd, because frankly I don't like the taste very much at all, but there seems to be an odd draw about it that makes me come back and take another taste, just after I though I couldn't drink any more. However, this sensation does not last to the bottom of the bottle, and ultimately I had to dispose of it.
This was a disappointment frankly. Under=carbonated, and a beer that didn't look attractive and was WAY too busy to really get a handle on. Perhaps in very small quantities, and warmed?? I don't know what lead me to think that, but it struck me that warmed on a stove, this might work well."

Pour is a murky brown body with average head and lace. Not that enamored with the color or the appearance and it has me a little unhappy.
On to the nose and taste. It actually drinks in a much cleaner than the color and bod would suggest. The light fruit touch and the cleanliness are traits that I have (happily) begun to associate with Baird, and they are attributes that I enjoy. the nose has a lightly spiced alcohol note, neither of which are truly enforced in the taste. The tastes impart a fruit note (which I suppose are the figs) but frankly could be an orange, citrus based flavor as well. The cinnamon is really muted, and again could really be any, light, winter spice. Frankly it tastes better than it smells and a LOT better than it looks.
Pretty simple, Winter Warmer type of beer, and one that you would probably enjoy if you like the spice note to be a little more muted and less aggressive. Emphasis here is on a light fruit angle, which as I say above, seems to be angle that Baird takes quite a bit and one which I enjoy.
Not a classic Winter Warmer, but a lighter, fruitier version. One downside is the $10.99 price tag. Just a little too expensive to make it good value, although the beer itself is very nice."

A great depth of garnet color on the pour, coupled with super clarity and a decent head, the beer looks really nice in the glass.
Nose gives some really good, alcohol soaked malts with a brief promise of some toasty warmth.
The beer delivers a taste that is a bit drier and more bitter than the nose (and indeed the style) would suggest. It delivers the aggression that one would expect from a Doppelbock, but doesn't quite punch with the sweet blows that one might expect. Extremely bready beer with lots of yeasty tastes.
The beer finishes with a drier and less sweet ending that I would like.
Strange one this, it has some characteristics that one would obviously associate with the style, but then again it seems to lack the classic sweetness."

Gusher from the bottle that leads to an ugly pour. Murky reddish brown with large specks of yeast floaties in huge quantities. This beer is obviously struggling through either an excess of bottle-conditioning, the lack of filtration or some other final stage issues.
Given the amount of foam that gushes from the bottle, the head and lace a woefully disappointing.
Nose and tastes give an overly aggressive bitter, hop note that tastes like an American Barleywine or DIPA gone wrong. It tastes something like an Arrogant Bastard clone that was made by a poorly skilled homebrewer. Odd aftertaste too. Odd mouthfeel comes with the excessive carbonation of the body.
This may be my first beer from Mad River and it's a very poor introduction. Lack of balance, huge, nondescript poorly managed flavors, and the suspicion of some kind of inability to package the beer correctly. Off-flavors of hop soaked cardboard as well.

Honey orange color on the pour with a pleasing white head. The beer is capped with a frothy layer of thick bubbles and the head provides some nice, inviting lace.
Nose seems very weak and has me worried. It seems as though this beer has potential to be extremely light on flavor if the nose ids anything to go by.
I need not have worried. The tastes provide a really quite aggressive, fresh hop explosion. This is surprising for two reasons. First the nose did not give any of this away at all, and secondly it's not the kind of bitterness and depth of flavor that one usually associates with the style. Some fruit notes underpin the hoppy blast and beer comes together to give a very satisfying experience. Some soap notes amongst the hops as well. The toasty, pale grains support the beer nicely, and to be frank I'm pretty impressed.
More depth of character and flavor than one is used to with the style, so in that respect and exciting beer to drink. Good stuff."

Fairly innocuous looking, mid-brown pour with some creamy head but not much lace.
Nose and taste reveal quite a lot of the bourbon character, in fact a bit more than I was expecting. I'm not a huge fan of bourbon aged beers, but an American Brown Ale does at least seem like a sensible place to put such a thing, and this works fairly well. The bourbon notes are not exactly strong, but they do make a fairly steady appearance all the way through the drink. They also have the effect of tempering any overtly hoppy note that the American versions of brown ales tend to give. For me that's a really good thing, since the last thing I want in a creamy, smooth brown ale is a bunch of in your face hops. As much as I'm not keen on bourbon in my beer, if we are talking about a brown ale then it is a preferable flavor than a bunch of aggressive bitterness.
Smooth with a few other liquor (rum) tastes too, I like this a little more than I thought I might. It does feel a little thin to me, and that seems to be the one ""faulty"" area.
Having said all of that, I bet if you enjoy bourbon aged beers then this beer is one that you will enjoy."

Surprisingly black pour with little or no brown elements that one often sees with porters. Head and lace are frankly both a little disappointing even if they are a nice mocha color.
The nose reveals a touch of coffee but not any bitterness or hop character to speak of. I like my porters, mild, smooth and creamy and although Blackhawk hits to some degree on each of these attributes, ultimately I feel it misses the boat slightly. Some very mild char and a touch of acidity or sourness that one might attribute more to a stout.
Some more light, bitter coffee grinds in the finish, but otherwise a somewhat ""ordinary"" experience. Perhaps fresh, closer to the source and on tap I might like this more, but for now it's a beer that i could frankly take or leave."

Pour is a good looking, light, bright copper hue with some sticky, complex lace. Head is small and leaves just a ring around the extremities of the beer. Clarity is excellent, carbonation medium.
Essentially, if you've ever had an English, west country cider you will have had an experience mightily similar to this.
Nose and tastes reveal some fairly straightforward and simple light apple and cherry acidity that offer a pretty gentle introduction to a touch of light Brett and funk. the nose suggest a little more acidity than the taste ultimately delivers. Acidity is low, but present enough to let you know that you are drinking something that is a bit different. The apple and cherry notes become more fruity s the beer warms and the drinkability is high. 
The beer has a very refreshing, light touch and in that respect reminds me a little of a cider like Strongbow. Slightly less aggressive than that drink, and perhaps lower carbonation and hence a bit smoother.
Simple and that's its beauty. A great way to introduce a new, but LIGHT acid/sour/brett/funk experience to those with little or no knowledge of such things that will break them in gently without too much aggression."

A honey body sits underneath a tight, fine, dense white head. Nice lace.
The nose and tastes are very floral with the emphasis on the lemongrass rather than the orange peel or coriander. The body and mouthfeel are both very full and smooth and quite surprisingly so as the style can sometimes be a little light. Sensible ABV for a change, too.

The beer is essentially a Vienna Lager in terms of the way it drinks. Sweet, malty, pretty much no hop character and a watery mouthfeel. The dry element is just about the only way that it resembles the style, and if you are looking for any type of significant hop-based experience, forget it.

Orangey, yellow pour with some pretty fierce carbonation. The head that forms initially is very high, fluffy and white. It fades quickly though to give nothing more than a tiny film on the surface of the beer and one or two wisps of lace.
Little to report here other than a pretty sweet, thin beer that to be honest I don't mind too much. It has a lemony aroma but not much of that is transferred to the taste. Some acidity and fairly drinkable given the style circumstances.
The pale malts are the feature here and they support the beer quite well. Not devoid of taste and the can is a bonus."

Standard jet black pour with a smallish head. There is a distinct lack of body. The beer really is quite thin.
The beer pulls together an odd combination of attributes. It's quite sweet but it brings a terribly unrelenting solvent alcohol presence. The roasty sweetness that IS there and threatens to be a nice taste that the beer COULD hand its hat on, is once again overwhelmed by the rubbing alcohol/methylated spirits and paint thinner keep on coming through over and over again. Horrible, nasty burn that results in a drain pour for the second half of the bottle.
Oddly, the solvents are not so noticeable in the nose.

This beer is nowhere near as intense as I was expecting, which may be due to the age of the beer. It has probably calmed down a bit since it was first bottled.

The nose delivers a HUGE blast of cinnamon. Not subtle, not restrained and a little off-putting.
The tastes follow suit with some large cardamon, cinnamon and ginger elements all present. Underneath it all there are some caramel malts, but the spices are extremely dominant and also add a bit of herbal quality as well. There isn't much here outside of the spices but I'm not sure that they were trying to do much else. Alcohol well hidden.
This strikes me as a mood beer. If you are in the festive mood and want to indulge in a beer that reflects spicy, winter warmer type scene, then you would probably go for this. Outside of that context this could become a bit of an effort and you could tire of it very quickly indeed."

Obviously amongst the smoke and peat is a beer that is simply malt based with some caramel undertones with the sweetness. Very tasty and packed full of flavor.
Sprecher make some really fantastic beer on the malt end of the spectrum and this is no exception. Certainly pushing the peat notes to the absolute maximum for me, the beer is not quite as drinkable as I would like (because of the peat), but still maintains a high level of quality."

There's a big, 'ole piney West Coast nose upfront with this one. Quite herbal too.
Tastes are largely as expected with drying hops, aggressive bitterness and some hot alcohol, but this beer lacks the richness and complete, malt intensity that the other Bastards do. It feels like Arrogant Lite, and the mouthfeel matches the lighter feel. The lack of malt depth is what really distinguishes this beer from the other, similar beers that Stone brews. It has a strange, floral or herbal note that is a little off-putting. Quite surprised at how the hops seem to add pine and green herbal notes rather than straight up bitterness.
Not a beer I care for much, and given the excellence of Arrogant Bastard this is a beer that is difficult to purchase when the others are out there. One and done here."

Pour delivers a classic, English Pale Ale appearance with a slightly clouded, light amber hue with a spotty head that produces some nice retention and some sticky lace. All is well with the appearance.
Nose offers some lovely malt notes that have depth, plus a pronounced, buttery, toasty aroma. Nice.
Tastes reflect the nose and also bring a slight, light-rum character. NOT boozy, but it does have some raisin and bready notes. Short finish which is quite dry for the the level of malts that are present and defies the origin of the beer. Any sice notes (nutmeg and cinnamon are mentioned on the label) are extremely subtle, and that's one of the strengths here.
For intents and purposes this drinks like an English Pale Ale, and if you are anticipating a Scotch Ale or a Winter Warmer, forget it. Simple biscuit malts with hop character that adds a degree of unexpected bitterness is the real element here, and it tastes very good. Subtle, refined and gentle, many will miss the charm and sophistication of this beer."

I first tasted this beer way back in February or march of this year when I visited the brewery. I thoroughly enjoyed it then, so i was delighted to see that the bottles had finally made it out a couple of weeks ago - good stuff.
A honey colored, orange pour with nice cloudiness, a decent yeast sediment that makes its way into the Tucher Weizen 0.5 L glass and produces a light, non-dense head with a touch of lace.
The nose offers some sharp, fruity acidity and this is what we find in the initial tastes, too. Light citrus notes are the main feature here. A higher hop profile that perhaps is usual for the style, and all in all this beer has a MUCH deeper presence and depth than is usual for the style. Impressively brewed, Slammer Wheat seems to go well beyond the parameters of the style and to a heavier ""more present"" mouthfeel. A few soapy notes that become quite a feature of the taste.

There is no doubt that there is a degree of bakers chocolate in the tastes in addition to a touch of cocoa. A pretty dry beer considering the malt content. Chocolate actual builds quite a bit over the course of the bottle
Quite full in the mouth, the beer is very smooth and leaves a slight coating on the tongue and teeth.

When a beer has the generic words, ""Belgian Style Ale"" on the label it makes me nervous. When it's from the Holy Mackerel stable as well, it makes me even more wary, and to be honest I do not have high hopes for this beer before I open it.
A copper hue with a decent amount of lace and some creamy head that sits on top of the brew,
Firstly this is NOT, by any stretch of the imagination a beer that should be categorized as a Belgian Strong Dark. It fails to fit that category on a whole bunch of levels. For all intents and purposes this is a, ""slightly darker than normal"", Tripel.
The nose and tastes deliver most of the classic Tripel elements; a viscous body, plenty of sweetness, some fruit esters (pineapple) and a BIG dose of alcohol. In the back end there is a really interesting blast of herbal, juniper tastes and some bubble gum. The Tripel notes are backed up with some white pepper in the finish. A touch of honey in the sweetness and a little caramel and banana round things out. The bubblegum notes that come with some Tripels are subdued.
It's all there for a Tripel (with the exception of a light copper color rather than a bright, golden one) but ""Tripel"" is the benchmark that will tell you where this beer is coming from and how it drinks.
Quite tasty, and much more enjoyable than I was expecting, but this is a beer that you will want to drink in small quantities!"

Pretty light in the mouth which may seem like a good thing, but to be honest it feels a bit thin and watery. More bread and sweetness in the back end and finish.

Grainy, buttered toast on the nose with some slight grassy hop aroma - not much at all, even on warming.
Tastes offer an organic-like experience with a clean bill of malts making up the majority of the tastes. Some more light hay and grass but it never really adds up to much. Not much depth here, and I suppose that's OK, but the beer ultimately remains pretty ordinary. ""Sweet"" and ""clean"" are attributes in its favor, but not much else is.

Pour is a good looking, dark brown color with some nice clarity. Carbonation is relatively low which seems appropriate. Small head with some spotty film on the surface and a little lace. A little thin.
I read a couple of reviews of this beer which described a coffee note to the beer which to be honest I took with a pinch of salt. ""Coffee"" taste is one of those default, fallback tastes that I think people sometimes imagine in Stouts and Porters and other ""dark"" beers, and in a Brown Ale it seemed a little unlikely; in reality it was spot on!
Quite a lot of coffee in the nose and also in the initial tastes. The coffee settles down a bit and the beer goes into ""Brown Ale mode"" with a little nuttiness and some deeper malts. All of that is fine and dandy and it's quite nice, but the problem here is the alcohol. It seems to bump heads with the relatively subtle style, and with the mouthfeel being quite thin, it takes on a solvent aggression that grates on me very quickly. 
I suppose that Imperial Brown Ales are OK, but to me it gets tedious and drinking is not easy. This beer lacks the depth to hold up so much alcohol and in the end it gets quite solvent-like.
A potentially tasty profile spoiled by too much alcohol."

Pour is a very, very good looking golden orange body with a wispy, thinnish head. Not much retention, some lace.
Nose has plenty of sweet malts and perhaps a whiff of solvent like alcohol. Not very well defined as far as I could make out.
Tastes are built around that of a malty, relatively high gravity lager with some lemongrass notes. There is little or no juniper character, and the beer reminds me a bit of a watery Maibock. It really doesn't have a lot of body but in one way that makes it more drinkable. The alcohol seems to build over the length of the beer, or at least the alcohol TASTE, builds. There is a little bitterness in the far back end but it is pretty minute.
The bottle mentions the lemon peel, but it also says the beer is ""hazy"" which under absolutely NO circumstances is it.

Pour is an impressive jet black body with a tight head of very fine bubbles. Nice looking head and decent retention and lace.
Nose releases some bready malts and not a lot else.
Tastes release some very light alcohol notes amongst the very lightly charred, dark chocolate. A little bitterness that is the source of the slightly dry character. The dryness doesn't really ever get very high, which I suppose keeps it out of the Irish/Dry Stout category. A light, metallic bitterness lingers for a while on the palate as well.
Th body achieves the unusual, but welcome, combination of being pretty light but also creamy. Unusual to get hat combo pulled off. 
Alcohol pretty well hidden to be honest.
Extremely drinkable, in part because of the relative lightness of the body, but either way it goes down very easily."

Meh, when beer gets like this for me it essentially ceases to become beer and turns into an experience that is simply too much like hard work. You have to really work at this beer to appreciate it and drink it, and for me that begins to detract from the point of ""having a beer"".
It's a VERY high octane product no matter how one looks at it, and a beer like this could ONLY be brewed in America, or least by a brewer with a colossal American influence.
Pour is an attractive, reddish brown highlighted black, with a decent mocha head and a little lace and retention. The head has a coffee color to it.
The initial aromas are really quite sweet, and offer a boozy malt bomb that put s one in mind of an English Barleywine. When one considers the appearance and nose, all is well. The tastes are a different matter though.
What starts off as a reflection on the nose (sugary sweetness, lots of malts and plenty of booze), about half way through a vicious bitterness, led by unrelenting citrus and pine-needle base based hops, cuts right across the palate. It ends up being a puckeringly dry, charcoal based nastiness that coats the tongue and not in a good way. Some wood, some drying sawdust and a everlasting bitterness that dries the tongue and palate for scores of minutes after the beer is finished. Alcohol arrives in a loud shirt and wears its sunglasses indoors. Hot and unsophisticated in the extreme.
Rough around he edges, this beer screams aggression and frankly has all the hallmarks of beer that is trying to be a noisy, brash, uninvited party goer without much class.
Horrible finish and aftertaste, takes the beer from a smooth start to an almost unrecognizable ending. Impossible to drink more than maybe 18-10 of the 12 oz, this beer also represents absolutely APPALLING value. All that's bad about contemporary, American craft beer."

Pour is a hazy, honey colored amber with a fluffy white head and some persistent lace.
Aroma is pretty sweet with plenty of maple syrup notes, some more honey and brown sugar.
All of these aroma characters come together in the taste to produce a real, sugar sweet, malt bomb. Finish offers a little hop bite, but it's generally lost amongst the sweetness. Aftertaste lingers a little.
Mouthfeel is pretty rich and reflects the sugar nature of the beer. Quite full and a little viscous.
Very tasty with the honey like elements but you're going to need to enjoy a sweet beer to make much sense of this."

OK, small hiss/fizz as the cap is prized off, in a moment you'll see why that detail is relevant.
Pour gives a rich looking, thick, jet-black body with a few very dark brown highlights at the edges. The beer leaves some very impressive, tobacco colored film/oil on the inside of the glass like alcohol legs that cover the whole surface of the vessel. Impressive. ZERO head. ZERO lace.
Nose gives a really sweet, alcohol based aroma with some serious chocolate and malt notes. There is also a little smoke (see more later).
The tastes reflect the nose and are very rich and sweet. The chocolate, alcohol based notes are defined by their extravagance and richness, but they also come with a smokiness and a little acidity. Sweetness upfront and some charred notes in the back end.
Here's the rub - ZERO and I mean ZERO carbonation. Not just a beer with relatively low carbonation that we would expect, but basically a completely flat experience - like milk. In fact, the beer kind of reminds me of an alcohol laced, dark chocolate milkshake. Flat.
The aftertaste leaves a little coffee-grind bitterness which also has a slightly charred, charcoal based molasses.
I have a feeling that this bottle has somehow become ""uncarbonated"". Seems unlikely, but there really is no other explanation. There was a very small hiss as the beer opened but the lack of ANY CO2 seems odd. I couldn't even generate any head with a massively aggressive pour. Despite the lack of carbonation the beer still feels slick and rich in the mouth and is in no way thin.

Typical Pils appearance with a light golden body and a wispy head. the head lacks much presence for me.
The nose and tastes are in the right ballpark, but a re a little too sweet for my liking when I consider the style. I like my Pils to have a really strong Noble/Saaz bite especially in the finish, and although this beer delivers some of that, it doesn't really come through strong., there are quite a few residual sugars there which conflict a little with the bitterness that I am seeking.
Simple and drinkable with a little hop, soapy character which is good, but the beer lacks in in your face bitter punch in the finish and ultimately just feels too sweet for me. I need more soap and a lot more brutality in the ending.

Pour is a well carbonated, totally clear light straw color with a huge, fluffy and sticky head. Lace is pretty good too. Color is a little light, but otherwise looks pretty good.
Nice carbonation leads to a lively mouthfeel.
Nose is a little corny and vegetal to be honest, and does not inspire much confidence.
The tastes are citrusy. Some lemongrass but it is quite watery. The back-end and finish are very short, but it is clean with almost zero aftertaste. More slight, shandy-like lemon tastes fall into place.
Drinkability and thirst quenching notes are high, but outside of that the beer lacks much depth. It's really VERY light, and in that respect perhaps a good beer to introduce the BMC crowd to a new brewer."

Clear bottle presentation with the blue accents makes a very attractive proposition.
The color of this beer is truly a sight to behold. Beautiful clarity on the pour and a copper/red/burgandy body sits underneath a white head. Some lace and a fine film forms on the surface of the shimmering body.
Nose is surprisingly muted to be honest. Even on warming the liquor aspect is not strong to me (although it is certainly there), rather we get a slightly acidic, apple based note.
Similarly the tastes are not quite a huge as I thought that they may be. For some that may seem problematic, but for me it's the contrary. This really is quite a subtle beer, and had this been inspired elsewhere, the rum notes could have been overwhelming. As it is, it's pretty light. Sweet, mellow and surprisingly light and drinkable, the beer actually screams subtlety which is not how it could have turned out. Low carbonation which works well, and the dryish rum notes build over the glass, but ultimately still work swell with only a slight warming alcohol effect. For me the oak character is really pretty reserved and light.
Very enjoyable and it has a drinkability that is much higher than I was anticipating. Tasty and easy drinking."

The beer is much hoppier than I was expecting and this is the abiding memory. Some good levels of bitterness that makes the beer drink like a freshly hopped, American IPA. Some citrus notes and pretty, green and fresh feel about the beer. Malts are present in quantities that hold the whole thing together nicely. Alcohol is well hidden and beer drinks lower than the ABV would suggest it might.

Pour is a very rich looking, black color but does not have too much viscosity. Thin, creamy film forms on the surface of the beer.
Initial tastes give some nice chocolate malts and a healthy does of booze. These are the main competing/complementing factors. As the beer warms we get more and more liquor and sherry notes and the brew really starts to come into its own. As expected the nose starts to develop with warmth, too; a malt bomb laced with somewhat menacing alcohol.
Although the alcohol based malt is the obvious main factor here, there is a jarring hop bitterness that never leaves. It lingers, and makes itself especially known in the finish. Still, the beer is definitely sweet and nicely balanced considering the massive nature of many of the elements.
This beer remains a brooding, latently aggressive beer but also has style and presence.
A truly great beer when I tasted the original many years ago, and this maintains much of those characteristics. Strong and bold, this is not for the feint of heart."

Pour is a pretty light amber color with plenty of orange color. Quite hazed. A little head, a tiny bit of lace but not much retention. It looks a bit muddy.
The nose does not give way to any hop character, rather it gives a simple, malt sweetness and not a great deal more.
The tastes are intensely bitter in several areas. The front end is not too intense, but the middle, back end and finish are really quite shrap. It's not subtle at all. Strange really, becasue the beer is held togeher by a decent, biscuit like, English malt framework, but the beer also deviates fairly dramatically from highly hopped version of an English Ale (which is what one might think this would resemble).
The bitterness is obviously the feature here, and that's all well and good, but to me it sits a little awkwardly against the malt bill that it is coupled with. It's just not especially drinkable for me, and it seems as if there are two separate, competing factors. Not bad, just a bit awkward. For me, it gets caught between an English Pale Ale and West Coast hop bomb. Weird."

The tastes are based on the same light fruit and spice as the nose. The spice builds with warmth and as the bottle is consumed. White pepper is present, alongside a touch of aniseed. Perhaps a dash of pumpkin or cardamon. Some mace and some more obvious nutmeg. Even some carrot cake. Not much alcohol at all, and a nice, slightly lingering bitterness related to orange peel in the back end and finish. A few of the typical Unibroue yeast notes, but it seems a bit more muted than in many of their other beers. The yeast does get a bit bigger as it warms, as does a dash of wintergreen.

I have literally no idea what is going on here. If the attempt was to make a Flanders Red then this is a complete failure. If they wanted to produce a slightly watered down version of a DIPA, then success!
$14.99 (at least), in some locations even more expensive, for the 750 mL (plastic) corked and caged bottle. Cork is very difficult to remove.
Beer pours an ugly, murky brown that looks like tea. Head is initially good, but fades very quickly to give a thin white film on the top of the beer. Watery lace on the side of the glass. 
Nose has some watery hops, and not much else. The beer delivers a watered down hop taste like a bad DIPA homebrew. There is nothing more to this beer, other than a bit of alcohol in the finish. Water herbal notes make up the aftertaste. A bit of dryish, woody oak there too but it also seems like a mistake.
ZERO Flanders Red character and a bad, bad DIPA on top of that.
Since I heard about this collaboration years ago I was excited for this brew. After it came out and I heard that people were disappointed, I thought I would leave it to see if any Flanders Red character developed - it didn't. 
Total write-off and I am amazed that these two breweries allowed this beer to be inflicted on the public. Awful. Drain-poured a fair amount of it.

Word on the street is that this is essentially the same beer as this; http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/864/46125
but the beer has been ""tweaked"" a little in terms of the recipe, and (obviously) it has been re-branded as part of Red Brick's image overhaul.
The pour gives a nice, mahogany body with some light chill haze. The head is tan and light and bubbly. Retention and lace are below average.
WOW! The nose and tastes are ENORMOUS bubble-gum and fruity banana. ""Strong"" is NOT the word, it's an astonishingly powerful, sweet assault. There are some underlying almond notes, but these almonds a sugar coated! We then get a massive array of esters that follow through in the middle and the back end. Pineapple, pears and other tropical fruits are there too. Some alcohol that warms in the chest on the way down. A little slick in the mouth.
The finish is amazingly short considering the early assault, and the beer does not linger in the aftertaste as one may have though after the initial blast. Something to age? This needs to settle down a bit.
There isn't much subtle about this beer, and I suppose that's OK, but this beer will not please anyone who does not like a very sweet, fruity, Belgian style beer. I DO like this kind of beer, but to be honest this thing is really MUCH too over the top even for my, sweet-loving palate. 
The beer is not really like a BSDA at all, and I would favor the description of a fruity Dubbel, either way this is a pretty crazy beer. MUCH aggression in terms of the fruit, I bet lots of people will hat this. I don't, but it's really a borderline beer in all kinds of ways."

Nice golden clarity on the pour and a pretty high head. Head fades to leave a small collar and a little lace. Attractive.
Very strong (surprisingly so) sweet malt aroma builds from the moment it is opened. The sweetness carries into the tastes with some light hay, a bit of wet grassiness about it and a small whiff of organic notes. Appropriate, gentle carbonation. there is quite a lot of grain based sweetness here, but I like it. it lacks significant bitterness that might score it lower if we were really considering style, but it's still a tasty beer.
Clean and easy on the palate, and a nice ABV.
Quaffable and a light touch on the beer makes it a good thirst quencher. Obviously not a session beer, but one that could be consumed in fairly large amounts.

Pour is a mahogany brown with a nice frothy head. Relatively short lived, but still solid. looks nice, has good clarity and is well appointed. Nice.
The aroma is a mixture of some alcohol soaked raisins and a touch of burned malt.
The beer is not as sweet nor as complex as I was expecting. In those regards it lets me down slightly, however it still tastes superb. A little warming alcohol stills on top (and at the back end of) some gentle marzipan and a fruity blast. A touch drier than I was expecting, but the alcohol seems pretty well hidden to me.
A more gentle and subtle beer than I was expecting since it did NOT deliver a massive, sweet assault on the senses but still a superb example of the style. When drinking, the alcohol is a few notches lower than 11.0 % ABV would suggest and comes together nicely, but later I really felt the full force, almost as if the sweetness were hidden, but still came back to give me a headache!"

Drunk on numerous occasions on a recent trip to Jacksonville, FL, USA. This review is taken from one of the draft servings.
High head sits a top the amber body and leaves some superb, sticky lace.
The aroma and tastes match one another in as much as the beer gives a high fruit element amongst the hops. This is a fruity tasting IPA indeed, BUT it in no way skimps on the hop profile either. It's pretty unusual in the way in manages to combine the two elements that can be competing factors. Light grapefruit, and then a few more tropical, sweeter, softer edges to the fruit.
It's a beer that is somewhat of a paradox. It DOES have the signature aggression in the hop profile for an American IPA, but at the same time it also gives a gentle, softer sweet fruit note that I really enjoy.
It's a REALLY tasty beer but the ABV creeps up on me a bit and I really can't consume much more than 12 oz at a time. the drinkability is good because of the taste, but it's not a beer that can be consumed in any type of quantity."

Nose offers some light, fruity acidity and not much else.
The beer is pretty much exactly what is says it is going to be on the label; in some ways that is very encouraging. There is a pretty solid, brown ale base that offers some good malts, and on top of that we get the fruity acidity of the raspberry flavor. Both elements (raspberry and brown ale) compete for ones attention in equal degrees. Both are there, and both make an appearance, but to be honest this is also the weakness of the beer. It gets caught between the two and never really makes it as a brown ale OR as a fruit beer.
Lots of fine, reserved carbonation that makes the beer very creamy.
The color (when held up to the light) is the strongest feature, and although I don't DISLIKE it as such, it never really gets to where it needs to be as a Brown Ale or a Fruit beer.
Strange, a beer that limps to nowhere in particular but in a non-offensive manner."

The red wax on the bottle is extremely thick and a big pain in the ass to get through. 2009 vintage with the date embossed in the wax as per a seal.
The pour is pretty much un-carbonated and yields a murky, dirty brown body. Not attractive and little or no head.
Nose has an enormous amount of oak and associated liquor notes. Very good aroma. 
Tastes reflect the nose and there are a lot of residual sugars, sherry notes and some warming alcohol. Nothing that surprising, but we do get a somewhat unusual, cocoa, bakers chocolate, dry finish which is not what I was expecting. It's not really in line with the type of beer this is, but it does take the edge off the alcohol and in a strange way makes the beer more drinkable that it otherwise might be. Maple isn't really there at all.
As it warms the oak gets bigger and bigger and bigger, but the alcohol does not build much and the dry finish never lets up. A touch of tannin like bitterness at he very back end.
Body is pretty dead, but to be honest that is somewhat expected. Not full of life!

This is a very, very sweet beer that I actually like. It does NOT deliver a classic, Noble or Saaz bite (which I would want if I was concerned about style), but it is very drinkable.
Having said all of that it seems like it is closer to a macro, adjunct lager than a classic Pils, but it does have some kind of strange appeal.

OK, I have to admit that I was hoping that this was going to be a Belgian Dark of some description (given the Grand Cru moniker), but of course there is no reason why that should be the case, nor should I expect something like that from SN but a man can dream, can't he? Actually I got over that ""disappointment"" fairly quickly.
The nose and tastes have a lot of pretty clean, fresh, green, wet hop notes and a decent does of alcohol. To me this beer isn't really an American Strong at all (it doesn't seem to have the malt presence. The hop bitterness build and to be honest I feel as though this beer drinks much more like a west coast DIPA than anything else.
Lots of metallic green hops on the back end and the aftertastes. It's also pretty light in the mouth and doesn't offer much depth of body. That might be considered a good thing, but it's out of sync with the ABV for me.
Not a beer for me, and I think it has style issues (it seems more like a fresh hop ale to me) but there is NO doubt that it carries the SN trademarks. I suppose that can be both good and bad depending on your perspective and angle."

This is one interesting beer with a LOT of white pepper and herbal notes. It's really quite medicinal amongst the strong hop base, and the beer comes together quite well. The light aniseed and floral notes are repetitive but on each mouthful there seems to be a slightly different angle which keeps the beer interesting. Perhaps a note of mixed spices as well.

Off the top this is not your typical American Barleywine, so don't expect a hoppy concoction in the bottle - that just wouldn't be a Shmaltz beer!
The pour is basically a jet black pour with a HUGE, bubbly, mocha head. Really massive. This looks like a big, American, RIS in the glass.
The nose is quite alcoholic with quite a lot of fusel alcohol but paradoxically and somewhat confusingly, a big dose of malts also cuts in.
This is a VERY hot in terms of alcohol, but not in terms of it being a hop based American Barleywine. I find many American BW's things that I do not enjoy, and many of them are very hot as well, but funnily enough this beer is just alcoholic rather than a very aggressive, nasty hop-forward beast. I'm NOT surprised in one way (since this is a Shmaltz beer), but since it is labeled as an Ameican BW it does surprise me that there is no hop presence in sight. Plenty of licorice, syrupy sweet malts, light charcoal and a small,soy sauce finish.
This is a really strange beer (it reminds me a lot of Two Turtle Doves in as much as it's a has sweet elements of a Belgian that has had candy added, but also has the licorice notes of a Belgian based stout) and it has an amalgamation of many notes. Curiously, American BW is not really one of those things.
BIG and pretty hot, this beer is a CLASSIC cellaring candidate. In fact, in recent times, it's difficult to think of a beer that would be better suited to the job. Lay it down and sit back and wait. In time this could be amazing."

Nose and taste are pretty restrained for a beer of this style. there is a lot of sweetness amongst a few typical resinous, west coast notes. The sweetness remains the dominating factor amid the clean cleans. The beer is surprisingly simple and has lots of clean lines right through to the finish.

Pour is an amber color with some nice clarity, good head and some nice lace. Looks tidy in the glass.
Nose gives a few notes of toffee and caramel and the tastes reflect that. The beer has a few nutty elements and is obviously and definitely malt based, but as for being a Scotch Ale I just don't get it! If you are looking for some of those classic notes, then I think you will be horribly disappointed. If you are looking for a nice, simple, wintertime beer with some good levels of malt and a generally, sweet, malt based taste profile then you may well enjoy this beer. Don't look for classic Scotch Ale notes.
The price is a whole other issue, and this may be a Taco Mac problem rather than a Bell's problem, but at $9+ a pint this is one of the worst value drinks I recall EVERY buying."

Pour is a dark, dank looking reddish brown with some rocky, impressive looking head. LOTS of sticky lace too, a nice looking beer.
Aromas and tastes match very well. There is a VERY strong vinegar element to this beer that pushes the very boundaries of the style, and not really in a good way for me. The ethanoic acid notes are dominant, and although they diffuse over the course of the bottle, they are without question the featured taste. The beer never gets fruity or creates much in the way of traditional Saison notes, although I suppose one could definitely fir the vinegar into a ""funk"" character if one wanted to. Some dark, sour apple notes as well but not a great deal more than that. Quite aggressive and harsh.
It's almost as if this beer strays into sour territory and the brew never really smooths out very much.
This is a pretty interesting and tasty beer but it does stray a little too far from the predicted Saison/Farmhouse area for me. It's not traditional in that light in the slightest. OK, I suppose, but I find it a little annoying. Some will love this, but not really my cup of tea."

Typical pour into the DFH signature glass. Great looking golden pour with a large head head which is fluffy, dense and produces a lot of sticky lace. Lovely, whipped topping effect from the lace. Very thick.
Nose gives a little white pepper but also some bitter, herbal notes. Some hops in the nose. Some sinus clearing menthol.
Tastes are very interesting. Lots of Pilsner malts, but also plenty of herbal bitterness from the continuous hopping. The sweet malts are constantly competing with the bitter hops and the beer has a real battle going on between to the two extremes. The aftertaste and finish give a similar feel. A battle between the sweetness and the dry, peppery bitter notes. Finishes relatively dry for the style and does not leave a film in the mouth and is pretty clean.
I'm half expecting the alcohol to cut in more aggressively, but at 7.5% we've seen more aggressive ABV's in this style in the past, too. A little prickly nature in the mouth, but to be honest that fits right in with the style and enhances things.
Interesting beer as the typical, syrupy viscous notes that sometimes accompany this style are absent. Also the alcohol is well hidden and does not impinge upon the tastes as I have found with other impy pilsners.
Nice beer"

Pour is a very attractive, dark maroon color with a decent head and some nice lace. There is excellent clarity on the pour, and to be honest the beer looks really nice and inviting in the glass.
Nose is somewhat muted, and gives very little even on warming. A little bit of alcohol and perhaps a buttered toast whiff.
Tastes are fairly neutral but revolve around light toffee and caramel and not much else. Very little depth here and quite a thin beer in the mouth.
I could see this being a really nice beer with some work. If we could get some more depth to the caramel malts and tastes, or perhaps convert to a true Winter Warmer with some spices, we would have a half-decent offering from this ""budget"" brewer.

MASSIVE thanks go out to Steve for the opportunity to finally get my hands on this beer. I've been trying to get hold of it since I came to the US, and until very, very recently it was generally ""not"" available here. Despite several trade attempts I never managed to get one until Steve just simply gave me one! That's an amazing piece of advocacy that I will always remember.
Color is frankly a not particularly attractive, cloudy brown, Dubbel-like brown affair. However the head and lace are both excellent and lead to a more satisfying appearance than just the color alone with give.
Nose offers some pretty strong spice that reminds me of mace.
The tastes are quite aggressive. There is a lot of licorice, aniseed and herbal like spice and it doesn't let up much. The beer is very rich, exciting and bright to me. It satisfies and is smooth and sweet. There is also some orange peel and all-spice as well. Lemony yeast and more light liquor.
Despite the Easter moniker, this beer definitely has notes and spice that are VERY winter warmer like to me and this would make a great beer to savor in a festive moment. It's a classier version of a beer like Old Fezzywig.
A classic and extraordinarily delicious beer, BUT if you don't like a rich, dark spice in your beer it would be best to avoid this!"

I have had a few really NASTY experiences with Thomas Creek, so I approach this beer with a little trepidation to say the least. However, several people have told me that their experiences have been similar, but Up the Creek made them think again.
Off the top, the beer contradicts its ""Extreme IPA"" moniker in many ways (see below), so if you are looking for a classic, American DIPA look elsewhere.
Pour is a very attractive color indeed. A deep garnet brown that is bright, clear and really rich. Lovely looking. A thin film forms on the beer but expected virtually no lace.
It pours in a pretty viscous manner as one would expect but the beer is actually surprisingly light in the mouth for such a behemoth. In addition the tastes are really quite subtle. Plenty of malt based toffee and caramel, light touches of alcohol (well hidden) and only kisses of hop bitterness in the finish and aftertaste. Amazingly well balanced considering everything. There are a few liquor notes as well with a touch of whiskey and light peat warmth.
I am delighted that I let this sit for a while since it simply HAS to have helped the beer mellow out a little. I wasn't expecting much but got a really nice beer that I enjoyed.
This beer is the cross between an American Strong Ale and an English Barleywine. Alternate mouthfuls give me a little dry bitterness and warming, sugary, toffee alcohol warmth."

Extremely malty and musty nose. Lots of organic hay and and some degree of mustiness as well.
The nose goes into the taste with a yeast based acidity being quite strong. Fruit notes peek through somewhat, but this a German based malt bomb without too much else going on for me. Perhaps a little unfair as there is a tiny hop bite on the back end. Alcohol very well hidden.

Pour is a rich looking, clear orange with some good carbonation and head and lace to match. The lace is pretty sticky. Looks solid in the glass and almost has the look of a fine Belgian Tripel.
The nose delivers the typical spicy rye notes but it is pretty restrained and much less intense than many others that use the grain. The tastes reflect the nose and its light touch as well. The beer is sweeter than many rye beers that I recall, and the malts shine through against the notoriously difficult to suppress rye elements. Not too much bitterness at all. The rye adds a creamy elements that fills out the beer somewhat. There is a substantial feel about the mouthfeel which is a combination of the tastes and a fine carbonation.
I'm just not a huge fan of rye in beer, so that's the context of this review, but this is somewhat milder than most and I like it better than nearly all of the other rye beers that I recall. I'm never going to be a ""fan"" as such, but the beer is definitely one of my favorite interpretations of the style, even if I'm not in love with it."

Extraordinary hype has surrounded this beer in the last few weeks, and to be honest I even got a little caught up in it myself. I dislike it when that happens, but of course this is not one of those ultra-limited, one day only release affairs that I had to camp out overnight for (I'd never do that), so at least my dignity remained in tact. Anyway, on to the beer.
Into the DFH signature glass it goes.
Some slightly lighter hues at the extremities of beer that pours the color of cold, instant coffee. There is a very small head that fades quite quickly to yield a thin film on top of the beer. There isn't any lace to speak of, but the beer does leave some interesting, thinnish, alcohol legs on the inside of the glass. Obviously quite surprising given the ABV which is not all that high, and would not normally be expected to produce such an effect.
It takes quite a bit of warming in the glass before any significant nose comes through. When it does, there is a slight alcohol aroma with some very lightly roasted malts. Not very strong at any point.
The tastes deliver a touch more of the ethanol and a some very light sweet, roasted malts. I suppose there is some chocolate there but again it never gets strong. The alcohol actually builds quite a bit and gets mildly fusel.
Paradoxically the beer has a cream taste to it, but also seems thin in the mouth. Also paradoxically, a beer (and style) that you might expect to suffer if it has a thin mouthfeel, actually seems to benefit from the light touch that the mouthfeel brings. It makes it easy and very drinkable without ever getting heavy.
This is an extremely easy drinking beer, but the lack of real chocolate and quite high ethanol presence make it very interesting too, since it sits outside what I would call a typical Milk/Sweet stout and it sits outside of what it says on the bottle. It never gets really sweet, but is also never bitter. Strangely, the fusel alcohol is what stays with me.
It just never gets really creamy, milky or chocolatey which one would think could make this beer disappointing, but actually it isn't. Another paradox!"

Pour is a seriously hazed, butterscotch orange color with a persistent, thin film that sits atop the beer with some scant but pleasing lace.
The nose has quite a lot of ethanoic acid and is sinus clearing.
The tastes are very acidic - at least at first. It is difficult to know where this is coming from. Is it the Guava? Is it some kind of Brett infusion? Is it just a function of a farmhouse/Saison brew? The longer the beer drinks, it seems more likely that the fruit is the culprit, but nevertheless the pure acid lingers and cut across the finish as well.
There is a fine, light carbonation that breaks over the tongue and leas to a pretty nice, smooth, silky mouthfeel. I really don't detect much Belgian influence or yeast, nor do I get any significant fruit that cuts into the acid.
As in the case with this type of beer in general, the beer does get slightly less aggressive down the bottle, but there is no doubt that it still feels extremely acid based and vinegar like.
It's not an especially sour beer as such, nor is it the most tart beer that I can recall drinking, but it IS vinegar-like and it doesn't let up much.
All in all a very interesting brew, but not one I'm likely to go back to.A little too acidic for me without bringing the tartness or the edge of a Gueuze."

Nice light amber pour with a smallish head but it does produce a little lace. Plenty of citrus, slightly onion-based aromas. Tastes are clean, obviously nicely hopped and straightforward but ultimately forgettable. Well balanced and refreshing, but in the end it's simply just another hop-forward Sierra Nevada beer and not much else. In that respect it seems a bit pointless to produce yet another SN clone (at least from a beer and brewing point of view) but perhaps makes a lot more sense from a marketing and profit point of view. Some light spice in the hops and it finishes a little on the dry side.
There are some floral, grassy notes in there too, and overall it does ""feel"" somewhat organic, but not it a really significant, specific or even replicable way.
Ultimately fine, but no more than a typical SN beer, but at the same time the beer does not feel (or taste) significantly different than a bunch of their other fresh/wet/hop-forward beers, and in that respect is horrible value at the price point that it seems to command - maybe the $4-5 worth of wax on each bottle send the price up!?"

On tap, Taco Mac Douglasville, GA, USA. I've never seen this on tap before, but then again I've never really looked for it since this is a style that generally does not interest me much.
Pour has a couple of interesting aspects. Firstly it is black but definitely has some reddish brown highlights a the extremities, and secondly it produces a really nice, thick, creamy head (almost like a nitro-stout pour) that leaves plenty of pretty lace. It looks really good.
Nose and tastes reveal plenty of grap[efruit based, fruity citrus notes and a little pine. More ""East Coast"" than ""West coast"", which of course, is entirely appropriate. Some roasty malts too, but th ebitterness again generally comes from the hops rather than a darkened malt which again seems spot on for the style.
Finishes clean and easy.
For a style that I don't care for much at all, this was pretty good and pretty drinkable. I'd still prefer my IPA's/DIPA's to LOOK like those beers, but this replicates a bitter beer very nicely.
Having said that, not something that I would reach for very often in the future, however not a beer that you should ignore (at least once)."

There is a bit of peachy, orange floral taste in the background as well, but this is essentially drinking like a west coast IPA.

Pour is a somewhat alarming, yellow color that has plenty of macro notes about it but perhaps more importantly does not have the slightly darker, more orangey amber color that I was expecting. Head and lace are minimal.
The surprises continue through the nose and the tastes where there is an odd combination of Heineken-like skunk, Pilsner malts and a Saaz/Noble bitter ending. VERY peculiar indeed. The beer does have a malty start but never gets very sweet and it has an odd drying, biting finish that reminds me of a cheap, Eastern European skunky lager.
This is simply NOT my idea of a classic O'fest at all, and the beer, although not exactly nasty does leave a funny aftertaste and a very odd sense of style.
Weird, and frankly not good on a number of levels. I find it doubtful that the brewery is unaware of what this tastes like, so I am confused as to what they are trying to achieve. They certainly haven't produced a beer that I would classify as a contemporary O'fest - perhaps this is a more traditional approach?"

Not an especially attractive pour that generates a murky, reddish brown body, a nice, thick, creamy head but a carbonation that at first seems a little on the high side. After it all settles down it does produce a creamy feel and a less prickly mouthfeel than I first thought it might.
Nose and tastes give some gentle tartness and a really fruity feel. There is a truly fruit based cherry note but the sour element is pretty restrained. Almost sweet and sour. Not much dry character (I was half expecting some grape skins or other tannin notes that never really came on strong). Finish is satisfying with more of that restrained twang.
I like this beer a lot. Good depth of mouthfeel, a solid fruit note and a tiny, tiny tart note come together really nicely. Well rounded and a tidy beer that made me very pleased.
The other interesting thing about this beer to me is that although the BA db currently lists this as a Dubbel, AND notwithstanding the fact that there are many beers with more ""fruity"" character, nevertheless this beer STILL feels, tastes and drinks much more like a fruit beer to me than any other style."

Perfect golden clarity on the pour with some nice carbonation. Head and lace are a touch disappointing for me.
Nose and tastes are typical for the style, at least until the back end and the finish. The finish adds some fusel alcohol to the mix that I don't care for and sits especially badly in the style. Plenty of organic hop notes with serious sinus clearing capabilities, but the finish on the beer is quite boozy and beyond the, quite harsh and aggressive.
Thinnish too.
The more I drink of this the further it gets away from the style and the more the paint-thinning alcohol cuts in for me. It feels like I'm drinking a beer that is well above 6.6% every time that I swallow, and the beer seems almost like a splash of rubbing alcohol was added to top up each bottle. Some herbal/floral and medicinal character, but it never quite catches up with the alcohol.

Mouthfeel is a typical, syrupy assault. Alcohol is hidden behind the sugary fruit.

Curious to see what this has done in a few months.
Definitely more Belgian yeast character for me, and the grape elements seem to have dropped off quite a lot. This is not good news for me, since I really embraced them in the fresh beer and that is what I enjoyed the most, back in October 2010.
Alcohol seems a little more prominenet too. A few peppery notes have come to the fore as well.
I still really like this, but it has changed somewhat over the last few months and for me it has lost something. It produces some bubble-gum burps. Quite Triple-ilke in some regards.
Scores NOT adjusted at this time.

Original review 10/10

In a word - spectacular.
The beer (somewhat strangely) pours in two very distinct halves (I wasn't expecting the sediment to play such a role).
The first pour has a bright, perfectly clear appearance (beautiful clarity) with lively carbonation and a light golden hue that makes it look crisp and clean. The second half (obviously with a decent amount of sediment) pours with a fair degree of haze and less head/carbonation. Nevertheless, both halves have good head and retention/lace (considering the ABV) in the Duvel glass. Is this bottle-conditioned??
Nose and taste are both distinctly vinous which I am delighted with. Having heard that the beer had all of these grape elements, I was concerned that the content would have been hyped and that those elements would be subdued or not there in full effect - there was no need to worry, they are at the core of the beer and its presence. Wave after after of sinus clearing alcohol, edgy but clean vinous grape notes and serious white-wine acidity bring together a truly beautiful beer. It IS edgy; it has a fusel alcohol element; it screams organic volatiles, but it comes together with grace. Some grape skins, a little gooseberry and some other semi-hard green fruits, but ultimately a delicate beer that could stand up as a fine beverage in many culinary circles.
At first the edginess bothered me a little, but on reflection I think that it makes the beer. It is going to be interesting to see how this smooths out over time, but I would not want to lose too much of the clean, sharp grape notes.
Alcohol packs a FULL presence, but at the same time serves to give notice that respect for the quality of the beer is required. Warming, light burn in the chest reinforces the wine angle. Despite this, the beer seems REALLY light to me and the drinkability is huge even considering the alcohol content. The aftertaste delivers a pleasing bitterness with a clean, German feel to the hop base.
All in all the best VE Epic in many a year, and a beer that showcases a whole bunch of things magnificently well. I don't know if this was a tricky beer to brew - maybe not - but no matter how difficult the process was it is a spectacular success. Stone does this from time to time for me, i.e. blows me away. 13th Anniversary was the last and the first Arrogant Bastard many years ago was another, and perhaps I've become harder to please over the years but this is a beer for the annals."

Unfortunately, this is another relative disappointment which doesn' make the mark for me.
Pour is pretty much as expected with a low carbonated, jet black body that doesn't produce much head or lace after the initial, aggressive pour.
Requisite light, charred malts but the smoke is disappointingly restrained. I don't necessarily want a massive Rauch assault, but I DO want to get a decent amount of smoke to define the beer - frankly, it never arrives. The beer is quite sweet (which I like), but it never comes together to give a very satisfying experience for me.
This style (the smoked versions) is/are some of my favorite beers, but this one lacks the presence of say, a Left Hand Smoke Jumper (and YES I DO know there is a difference in terms of ABV for those beers)."

The nose offers a light but intense roast.
Tastes are very much the same, but a few pointers;
 + ZERO Belgian character
 + Well hidden alcohol
 + Some lactose notes
 + Licorice and burned character in the aftertaste
There is an annoying and lingering aftertaste that feels a bit milky to me, and coupled wit the lack of Belgian character this beer begins to grate with me a little. If you are looking for a Belgian Stout it might be better to reach for a beer like Two Turtle Doves. There is some chocolate here but it seems muddy and ill-defined.
Ultimately a bit disappointing for me, others may like it more."

Nose has a slightly medicinal acidity.
The taste is that of a lightly sweetened grapefruit with lots of decent fruit flavor. The beer drinks incredibly easily and is really refreshing. Light tart fruit notes give a nice sweet and sour combo and here is even a more ""beer-like"" malty aftertaste and finish.
I actually like this a LOT, and that's in relation to my love of grapefruit juice but also because I find it very refreshing and tasty. Is it a classic? Perhaps not, but I like it and I don't care who knows. So there!"

From notes.
A hazed, orange pour with a decent head and some lace. The lace is well formed and is nice and sticky.
Nose and tastes are rather wheat based which seems unusual for the style. Sweet elements from the beer which, given the style, I suppose is to be expected. The beer drinks very easily although the tastes are a little tiring (I couldn't see myself drinking much of this).
The beer has a slick mouthfeel which does make it easy to consume, but at the same time it makes it a beer that fills your palate and stomach quickly.

Nose is fairly neutral but the tastes are better. I'm always looking for a dry finish with the Reds and this beer delivers that. There is some sweeter fruit to temper the dry grains and the beer works nicely.
All in all a very solid effort and a beer that I could easily work with. Tasty and simple, the style highlights are hit nicely and the beer could be offered as a cross-over or introduction to a new style for a noob."

Pleasing nose with some gentle fruit and spice, but that doesn't really manifest itself quite as strongly in the tastes. Perhaps even the few months age on this has not treated it all that well, and it would have been better, fresher. Dubbel like fruit notes and some mild all-spice. Quite rich in the mouth - pleasing.

Poured into the DFH signature glass, the beer pours a very attractive color (a copper/garnet body) but has a somewhat disappointing head with only a tiny amount of retention. A small film forms on the surface of the beer with a tiny, white collar. It lacks the richness and noisy pour of the best beers in the style.
Nose offers an aroma that I would characterize as a fruity, American DIPA effect. Some alcohol.
The tastes reflect the nose, BUT there is more fruit than hops, and also a certain acidity. Strange combination of tastes that alternates between working well in one mouthful and not combining quite so nicely in the next. Just when you think this is going to be a fruity, American strong ale, the hops quickly kick in with a large amount of dry character and make the beer quite bitter. Definitely some American Barleywine character but it never gets REALLY aggressive (as is often the case for the style). American Barleywine ""lite""??
To be fair, the beer DOES remind me of an Arrogant Bastard, but it's nowhere near as good, as drinkable or as smooth. It's too edgy (and not in a good way) and it lacks a refined, classy presence. A boozy, dry finish as well that delivers some warmth on the way down.
It IS tasty, but it's a beer that seems to ultimately fail to get its act together properly and leaves me hanging. just seems like it never got finished correctly."

Blood red, scarlet pour with a big fizzy, pink head on the pour. Obviously this fades quickly to leave no lace and there is almost no retention.
The nose makes it obvious that this going to be pretty tart. A little funk in the nose and we also get a touch of the horseblanket in the tastes.
Initial tastes (unsurprisingly) prove that. Some light fruit, but otherwise it is ALL dry, tart, apple notes with the usual cider elements being repeated for a man with West Country experience.
The sharp bitterness is frankly the only aspect that makes any sense here, as anticipated but as it warms we do get a touch of raspberry. Even at the higher temperatures the raspberry remains a restrained element but it manifests itself with a bit of a sherbet, candy note.
These beers ALWAYS take on a less aggressive element as they warm, and this is no exception. Carbonation in the mouth remains high and slightly prickly despite the lack of life in the body, in the glass.
Nothing that i didn't fully expect here, and in that respect the beer works well. Obviously you have to be in the mood for this kind of thing, but when you are nothing else will do."

Bottom line is that this is not a very good beer.
The appearance is odd. It has a macro feel about it in as much as it comes with a huge number of small bubbles clinging to the inside of the glass. It looks highly carbonated, but the beer seems largely lifeless and there is no head or any retention. There is a darker color than a typical macro would give which I suppose is from the honey element.
The nose and taste do deliver a little sweetness from the honey, but they are minimal and all in all the beer is weak in taste, and dreadfully poor in terms of its presence. It lacks any depth at all, and feel watery and light without much taste at ALL.
Light and gassy, the beer lacks any depth that one would expect the honey to deliver.

As for style points - close to zero. It's a macro, Euro lager for all intents and purposes and I would NEVER have guessed German Pils in a 1000 years if tasting this blind.

Nose and tastes are distinctly malty (as an English Pale often is), but it lacks much (if any) of the distinct, biscuit malts that the real thing would have. In that regard it's not at all authentic for the style, even if the beer does still manage to deliver a decent, malt-based experience.

There is a turbid orange pour which disappoints. I really want a good clarity on any Pumpkin beer. Some low level head and a little bit of lace.
The nose replicates the combo of pumpkin and light liquor notes very well. I don't get excited about the aroma much, but it does it well. There is also a VERY strong, alcohol note that comes out of the glass which literally makes my eyes water.
The tastes also produce a very obvious barrel-aged note amongst the pumpkin, but it also combines to give a bit of a vegetal, carrot taste. The alcohol is also nowhere near what the aroma would suggest. Odd. There is lots of sweetness too, and the liquor notes are really quite subtle. Melds well.
The one good thing about this beer is that it does EXACTLY what it says on the label. This is often a problem with American brewed beer, but here it hits the pumpkin and barrel-aged notes pretty much on the nose - it doesn't *do* much for me, but it does a good job of replicating them.

Nose is quite rich and boozy and promises much.
Frankly, tastes are less impressive. There is a very distinct chalky nature to the beer which detracts from the richness in the mouth and also leads to a diminished taste profile. Elements of alcohol and light roasts are there, but the residue that coats the teeth and tongue subtract from the overall experience a bit.
It IS true that as the beer warms things get quite a bit better, both with heightened alcohol and some more warmth and depth of character. However, the beer still finishes with a dryish, precipitate feel - the solid suspension sits somewhere in the middle of it all. Light burn in the finish too.
This is not a clean beer at all, and although all of the requisite elements are there the mouthfeel and richness is not, and the chalky feel really gets in the way for me. Ultimately this does not do it for me."

The nose offers a LOT of west coast, medicinal, sinus clearing, grapefruit and citrus based hops.
I'm almost instantly annoyed by the beer as soon as it hits my taste buds. For all intents and purposes (in least in terms of its taste) this is an IPA. Not a problem, but in the BA database it is listed as a BSPA. There really isn't much else here other than a strong citrus based, IPA profile.
All of that is fine, but the Westmalle yeast is simply not present in the taste. The beer is NOT even a Belgian IPA! The hop presence (which is very tasty BTW, and is in the manner of a ""Fresh Hop"" style) overwhelms any possible Belgian notes (either in terms of yeast or candi sugar).
Syrupy, viscous feel which is appropriate for a beer of this ABV.

The funny thing is, that the beer tastes a LOT better than the appearance would suggest, BUT it is an incredibly fruity, sweet IPA and NOT one that shows any signs of significant hop bitterness or any alcohol (I was amazed to see this listed at 7%).
There are some light pineapple and bubble-gum notes, but also some almond (marzipan) tastes too. It drinks a bit better than that description might suggest, but there's virtually no hop bitterness that I pick up.

Anyway...



...16 oz pout at Taco Mac on the East West Connector, Austell, GA, USA.



Pour offers a nice clarity with a lighter than expected golden color. It certainly doesn't have much ""Red"" or ""Amber"" color. Head is about average and offers some lace. Looks OK.



Nose and tastes offer the usual Red Brick experience. Solid, OK, but pretty much forgettable. Simple hop profile and a gentle malt backbone hold the thing together. Seems to me like there is a familiarity about the yeast strain used which I don't dislike as such, but it seems to offer a certain blandness to most of Red Brick's beers. BTW - I'm NOT sure this is a fact, but it drinks that way to me.



Finish is clean, but it's presence is just so so for a beer that has been (apparently) brewed as a ""one-off"" and as a ""special"" release. 



Drinkable? Sure, I'd have one or two (well, maybe one), and ultimately disappointing and terribly uninteresting.



Not offensive, but a light caramel based beer with no distinguishing character as per usual from the ""rut"" that IS Red Brick Brewery. What I'd expect from Taco Mac, the beer destination for consumers that *think* they know beer but really just tick beers to collect T-shirts."

Beer opens with a slightly disappointing lack of pop, but the pour is better than the lack of gas might suggest. Although the color is that slightly clouded, not particularly attractive mid-brown, Dubbel like affair, it is pretty much as I expected. The head and lace are much better, and the creamy residue that sticks to the side of the glass is very pleasing and reminds me (in a good way) of a nitro pour.
The nose is chock-full of malty fruits. The aroma is reminiscent of a Belgian strong with some prunes, plums, raisins and other dark fruits.
Initial tastes reflect most of that, but add a traditional, lightly smoked, peat element that meshes really well. Some super alcohol notes (which is somewhat surprising considering the restrained ABV), and it also adds a light alcohol touch in the backend and finish/aftertaste. A touch of estery pineapple too.
Mouthfeel is resplendent with a creamy finish and a full feel.
The difference between this and Terrapin's version of the style that I had a couple of days ago is STARK, and not in a good way for the Terrapin guys. This is a benchmark in the style for me. Not my favorite style but a really great beer in the genre."

Pour as expected is jet black, but the head reminds me of the Guinness my dad used to drink with a really solid, rocky nature to it. Impressive.
This maybe a combination of mind games and tricks, but his version of the classic black stuff seems richer, deeper, darker and sweeter than many others. The mouthfeel seems particularly rich and I even get a splash of smoke in the back end. Some nutty elements too, with peanuts being part of the game.

The nose gives up a LOT of chocolate. I was really expecting that, but it is pronounced and keeps coming. A little alcohol.
The tastes give up a massive amount of warming, liquor like alcohol quickly. Very mild chocolate malts come in behind the warming alcohol, but it never gets as big as the nose might have suggested.
Smooth and slick in the mouth that compliment the alcohol nicely.

Extravagant presentation with thick, gold foil and corked & caged presentation with a fancy label. Close to @$20 for the chance to try this.
The pour is interesting since on the first two pours into the Duvel tulip there is little to choose between this and Duvel (nice golden clarity with a high, rocky, white head), but on the second two pours there is a lot more cloudy character.
Initial tastes do not detract much from simple Duvel either, but if anything the alcohol presence is slightly dulled as is the Belgian character of yeast, esters and light candy. Dulling those attributes serves no purpose and seems like a waste of time.
The extra hop character does build over the course of the beer, but it never really amounted to anything that supersedes (or ""betters"" Duvel) - in that respect I see no point. Some bitterness builds along with a dry character, and it's not unpleasant, but WHY? Increased grapefruit is DEFINITE, and increased grapefruit is something I generally enjoy, but...
...""WHY?"" remains the underlying question here. This beer doesn't stray THAT far from Duvel, but why bother at all? I don't get it and frankly ultimately I just crave a straight-up Duvel even more."

The usual hoopla that is associated with DFH (relatively) limited releases that is beginning to leave me cold. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of DFH but the hysteria that has been building over a number of beers in the recent past is getting tedious. Ho hum.
Pour reports nothing. It's jet black and there is not much head. Perhaps a few red highlights but so what. Good but standard.
Not a particularly rich RIS, in fact rather average. Solid roast notes, a decent splash of alcohol and perhaps some spice from the odd ingredients, but ultimately sort of unmemorable. I would not go out of my way for this, and in the end it does not stand out.
Again, don't get me wrong this is a tasty, nice beer, but some of the hysterical yabbering about this beer has been a little ridiculous. By all means buy a bottle and enjoy it, but expect a standard, good RIS and leave it at that.

In the updated presentation for the Limited release Series from Redhook.
Actually, the style forced me into aging this for a year because I knew I would probably not enjoy the alcohol and hop intensity when it was young. This both is almost exactly 1 year old, and carries a date of SEP 09 2009.
Pour and nose are exactly as expecting, giving a mid-brown, low carbonated body with a lot of hop aggression and some alcohol. Head and lace are both minimal (again as expected for the style and ABV). All in all, not much to report initially, and pretty much to style - so far, so good.
Given that initially this beer fits the style well, I am assuming that over time these tastes have changed and mellowed a LOT. There is a fair amount of peach-like fruit character, a decent amount of sweetness and a hop profile that has probably dropped off a lot. Much more malty than I expected, and I suspect it is a lot smoother than it was a year ago.
Good decision to leave this for a year, and pleasantly surprised."

Carbonation seems a little low to me. Lacks spark, depth and life.
Massive, and I mean massive, bubble-gum presence in the taste; OVERWHELMING in fact. There is almost nothing here other than the bubble-gum esters and a little warming alcohol. The funny thing is that I quite enjoy the bubble-gum character normally, AND it is somewhat appropriate for the style, BUT this beer is so over the top it's damaging. Too strong a presence by a mile.

Beer does DEFINITELY not have the color of a Belgian Pale, and on the menu it was advertised a ""Strong Golden Ale"" which again, it most definitely isn't. Not sure what they are going for here. To me it has more of the character of a dark(er), Belgian ""single""/""simple"" with perhaps a hint of Belgian IPA character in there too (American influence - unwelcome in my book).
The pour is amber with a fair amount of chill-haze. Light, but appropriate carbonation and a relatively smooth mouthfeel.
The nose and tastes combine to get an interesting sweet-sour note of light pineapple and then in the back end some more pineapple. Nice touches of Belgian yeast and some alcohol. All in all quite enjoyable.

Hazed, orange pour with a bone-white head. Not much lace. Unusually light in color for a DIPA with almost a Hefe (or a least a wheat beer) look about it.
Nose has sweet, sugary citrus which is replicated in the taste. Not especially bitter, and frankly a pretty reserved and low hop presence in this beer for the style. This is NOT a complex or complicated beer by any stretch of the imagination, and for me that's the appeal. Simple, tasty stuff.
Pretty drinkable, but there's no way that one could describe the tastes as typical for an American DIPA where the hop presence is supposed to be high. Definitely NOT a ""West Coast"" version of the style, which I suppose, makes perfect sense. Short finish without lingering bitterness. Alcohol very well hidden considering.
Not a classic example of the style, and I would imagine that this will disappoint many people that are looking for some palate wrenching bitterness. For me though, it works well and I enjoyed the simplicity of the beer despite the high ABV."

Unpleasant non-descript, artifical fruit taste greet the nose and mouth and imparts a sickly, sugar attack on the senses that defies any real, specific explanation or description. It's definitely like some kind of generic fruit ""punch"".

Nice combination of spices in the nose and the taste. The dominant flavor is a warmish, ginger. The ginger actually burns a little and is quite strong, with a little heat. The beer is plenty simple and reflects what one would expect from the style, but the ginger heat is definitely the feature that lingers, even giving a light burn in the chest on the way down.
A little alcohol warmth and even more ginger. The ginger mimics the alcohol warmth.
The beer is a little light in the body, but all in all I did enjoy it. You've really got to like the niche of pumpkin because without that you are going to find this difficult to cope with, but no more than any other in the style."

Peach colored pour with a nice head that produces some lace. Th beer actually looks OK, as long as you observe it for what it is and no more. 
The nose is that bad either, with some artificial raspberry notes and some lightly acidic lemon. Things go awry when the tastes cut in. The nasty, fake sweetener taste that cuts across the whole drink is where the beer fails. It leaves that nasty, dry aftertaste. The fruit is there, and to be honest it's not too sweet or actually unpleasant but it seems fake. A little more lemony acidity and we're done here.

The pour is a very deep, chocolate brown with a lovely, mocha head and a little lace. The depth of color is impressive.
The nose is even more impressive. An incredibly deep, malt bomb with lots of alcohol and plenty of chocolate notes. The nose and tastes also reflect more than a touch of whiskey too, but it's still classic Doppelbock. Plenty of alcohol comes through, but it seems appropriate and in sync with the style so nothing to concern you there. 
The mouthfeel is without exception, the weakness of this beer. Under no circumstances is it poor or watery, but it does not reflect the depth of color or the depth that we find in the nose. In that respect it is a slight disappointment.

The pour and the appearance are most definitely the weakest points. A light brown, murky affair with an annoy over-carbonation that leads to a difficult pour and foam that snakes out of the bottle.
After the somewhat disappointing appearance things REALLY take-off in a serious manner.
The nose and tastes yield a pretty much perfect combination of light liquor and beautiful depth of raisin based fruit, alongside a lovely, candied Belgian presence, with gentle warming alcohol. This beer has alcohol hidden beyond belief but still delivers a caressing, seductive warmth in the chest on the way down. Layer after layer of malt goodness break on the tongue with light peat and repetitive smoothness. the beer repeats it's gentle kiss over and over again that creates a lingering, loving ending and an aftertaste that is difficult to remove.

Well, this certainly lives up to the name, a strange beer to say the least.
I don't quite know how to describe this, but it drinks like a dry, hoppy Marzen. It's odd because the last thing that you would associate with a lager of that basic description would be a dry character or a bitterness - odd.
Perfectly clear, the beer pours with a disappointingly scant head, not much lace and golden orange hue.
The nose is really rich and nice. It offers some classic sweet notes and some pretty malty notes - like a classic, German lager should. The tastes however cut in with a profound bitterness that is very dry. The hoppy notes seem really aggressive and the lingering dry tastes attack again in the aftertaste. Dry, dry, dry!
Odd, since the taste as described above does not suggest much drinkability, and indeed I would not want a lot of this, but the beer is not horrible.

Nose delivers an unusual combination of a decent Pils-like bite of hops, but also a sweet background to the beer. The sweetness is the thing that stays with me which would normally make me a little unhappy, but the fact that there IS a decent dose of hop bitterness too, helps me to enjoy this beer a little more than I thought I might. Then sweetness comes with a touch of fruit, a bit like some peach infused soda.

Nice looking pour with a very attractive golden color and plenty of head. Some retention, a little lace. Solid looking.
The aroma gives a little white pepper and a few sinus clearing elements, but nothing out of the ordinary for a Saison. HOWEVER, this does not set me up for the taste!
The taste is a garlic laden, herbal assault that is difficult to get to grips with. It's abusive up front, but fades a bit as the beer warms. Nevertheless there is very little subtlety here. Perhaps this is the point of the beer I dunno, but it still makes it hard work.
Green elements, almost reminiscent of chewing on some floral hops are followed by a bitter, unrelenting, aggressive finish and aftertaste.The beer constantly recalls accidentally chewing on a cardamon seed in a great curry, or perhaps getting a mouthful of rosemary that was not properly integrated into a great lamb dish.
Extreme, and not not necessarily in a really good way. Barely even beer in the truest sense of the word.
I think this is a classic example of American brewing going awry. Stupid beer, flawed concept, difficult to drink, no point."

Beer pours with a brown, Dubbel like color but with more clarity than one associates with the Dubbel category.
The bottle opens with a disappointing lack of pop, but pours in a very much better manner than the opening would suggest. the beer yields a lovely, creamy, cream colored film on the surface of the beer, and produces a small amount of broken lace. Nice, light booze in the nose that produces some decent sherry aromas.
There's a decent amount of yeast in the nose and this get carried forward to the taste. Some fruit, a little alcohol but the beer also produces a mouthfeel that is reminiscent of a nitro pour - strange.
Plenty of sweetness and a nice balance from a really malty background. A little boozy, but it comes in with some sherry notes and a touch of almond marzipan.
Definitely an odd beer. In summary I would say that this is a cross between a Dubbel and a BSDA, with a few alcohol notes and with a strange (but good), nitro-pour character.

The beer pours as one would expect. Jet black body with a tan head that produces a little lace and some alcohol legs.
The beers' overwhelming aspect is a deliberate and sapping dryness. It's not the alcohol that you remember (it's well hidden), nor is it the considerable bitterness (which is persistent) and it's not even the roasty, burned and slight charcoal notes (as they should be present), but rather it's a chalky mid and back ending that will not go away. ""Chalk"" is really the dominant adjective for me.

Pour is a bright, honey orange affair with a large, but somewhat light and thinnish head. The head is not especially well retained and there is little lace, both of which seem to be a function of the high carbonation of the beer.
At times the beer almost seems ""fizzy"" and this obviously detracts from the mouthfeel. 
The aroma and tastes definitely have a nice Belgian yeast character, but ultimately that's all it is - a ""character"" rather than a fully blown presence. The beer needs an entirely larger and brisker presence to challenge the better beers of the style. Some dry pineapple does cut in, but the estery fruit notes seem to fade just one wants them to cut in with a vengeance.
A little more fruit in the finish but it also dies a slow death in the mouth.
It just feels as though the beer needs an injection of flavor to get it over the hump. God forbid, but it almost feels like it's a ""Lite"" Belgian Pale@ Gulp..."

Nose and tastes are essentially a malt bomb which may confuse those people looking for a West Coast style DIPA. I have no problem with a DIPA taking on some significant malt character, but in this case the beer seems overwhelmed by a bready sweetness that is unrelenting. I suppose it's all in order, but it actually makes the beer have a very low drinkability IMO - surprising coming from me, since I usually enjoy that aspect of many beers.
Very little hop character and a LOT of Barleywine-like features, but strangely without the typical hop aggression of the American BW, or the sherry-like notes of the English original.
My first CCB beer, and to be honest, given all the hoopla surrounding this brewery I'm not greatly impressed. Having said that, the amount of hype that accompanies certain, new breweries and their beers these days, how could the hype be justified? Impossible.

The beer does provide the typical element for the style- plenty of malt, yeasty aftertaste and a moreish and yummy taste, however the whole beer seems to drink WAY above the 5.4%.

Nose and tastes replicate a west Coast style DIPA quite nicely with huge grapefruit, pine and alcohol notes combining to produce a beer that represents the style VERY well. I need to be in the mood for this type of beer, but if I were, this would fit the bill nicely. With deliberate and obviously big alcohol, a syrupy mouthfeel and an aggressive blend of malt and hops, this beer is not trying to be anything other than an abusing assault on the palate. However, like great DIPA's of this ilk, it still manages to remain within the parameters of the style (whatever they may be) and has just about enough of each element to hold the whole package together.
I seldom want a beer like this, but if and when I do, this would be a good one to turn to.

Tastes are inoffensive but frankly they lack any kind of Saaz bite or bitterness. The beer comes through with some creamy, neutrality but in the end it is somewhat weak. A lack of crispness and a lack of dark, bitterness that I expect from the style.
The bottle calls this a ""Weizen Pils"" which I'm not sure means, but there is a light haze in the body. The bottle also boasts that there is sweet malt (true) and bitterness (not true).

There is a touch of warmth in the finish and aftertaste, but it's pretty mild and the alcohol is generally well-hidden for a 10% beer.

As soon as I tasted this beer I knew that if I read a few reviews at the lower end the criticisms would be that ""this doesn't really taste like an American DIPA"", and to be fair those reviewers are correct - that why I LIKE this beer! If you were to review this beer in a stylistic manner it would score very badly, but to me it drinks really well and is fantastically tasty, however if you are looking for a typical, American DIPA you are going to be severely disappointed.
Pour is a very nice mid-orange with some decent head, retention and lace.
The nose yields some alcohol and a little malty sweetness, but not really any hop note.
The tastes are very similar to the aroma and frankly the hops are pretty much conspicuous by their absence. This is a well put together, malty pale ale that has a slightly bitter and warm finish that rounds out nicely. Frankly, and rather confusingly, this is basically a beer that drinks like a malt-bomb rather than a hop bomb. Finishes with some warmth and a slightly liquor like back-end. Some sweetness and sherry round out the beer.
Very moreish for me, and a tasty beer that showcases the maltier side of things very well. Smooth in the mouth, it coats and is well balanced.
A catastrophic failure as an American DIPA, but a very pleasant to drink beer IMO. Reminds me more of a lighter Scotch Ale or a malt infused, ""double""pale ale in the English style. tasty."

Nose is VERY good with a strong sherry like, alcohol smell that is very enticing and promises much.
The beer delivers some of the characteristics that the nose does, but they are somewhat muted. Some light fruit, alcohol and more sherry plus rum, but not as intense as the nose would have suggested that they might be. Some oxidation, but that was to be expected with the slightly older nature of this beer.
Carbonation is where the beer falls down, with a thinnish body being rudely interrupted by a a fizzy, out of place , prickly carbonation. A little annoying.
The beer gets a little watery as it drinks too.
Well, considering the gluten free aspect this is not bad, however the body is where it falls down. I would drink this again, but not as good as St. Peter's Sorghum that I would buy again."

12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Mid-orange, macro like pour with good levels of carbonation and a rocky, if somewhat small head that produces some lace.
Nose and tastes are both lightly hopped with some of that characteristic soap note that can flag a beer with some bitter character. Dry body and a touch more bitterness make up the back end and finish. Definitely some grassy, hay like notes which is typical of many organic beers.
I was surprised by the hop-forward nature of this beer. No, it's not ""hoppy"" per se, but it does deliver a larger amount of bitterness compared to expectations."

Not sure what to expect here, but what I do know is that it is brewed with the Sorachi Ace hop and the ""Ancient"" Kaneko Barley. Having not especially enjoyed Brooklyn's Sorachi rendition, I get a bit nervous about this beer.
Pour is a slightly hazed, golden body with limited head, retention and lace.
Nose and tastes give an awkward combo for me. There is a yeasty, light funk in the nose which promises much. It appears from the aroma that the beer is going to drink in a classic, Saison type manner with a light acidity and touches of traditional horseblanket and musty notes. All of these have great potential for me, however, when the beer reaches the palate it forces an IPA like bitterness on to the palate that just sits really awkwardly. There is a touch of lemongrass and honey in there too (good), and some other brief citrus notes, but then we get a blast of sweetened grapefruit and the beer falls between two stools as it aggressive seeks your attention. Sweet background complicates the issue for me.
Since my experience with Brooklyn's Sorachi Ace was almost identical (in terms of the odd, competing tastes), I feel that this is a feature of the hop and it's not something that I care for me. It's like the beer is trying to be a hoppy Saison, and it cuts right across both styles and does not deliver well on either front. More sickly sweetness too.
An odd beer for me, and not something that I'll be going back to anytime soon."

Typical Dubbel color with a burned orange appearance with a better than average head. Some creamy remnants form on the sides of the glass and on the surface of the beer.
The beer exhibits quite a lot of fruit in the nose and the taste with an emphasis on alcoholic, dry pineapples or peaches. Some marzipan notes as well. The combination of obvious malts and slightly more subtle yeasts drive this beer to a good place and it's nicely put together. In sheer terms of being ""well-brewed"", this is one on Terrapin's best efforts.
Finish is short.
I like the beer, mainly because it is so clean. Dubbels are a difficult thing for me as they have the potential to become somewhat ""muddy"" and lose definition. This one holds up well and has the potential to become a more frequent visitor to the Terrapin stable."

A classic example of the American Red style with potent hops, but bitterness that is tempered by a dry, rich malty backbone. Perfectly balanced, this is one aggressive beer, but, at least for the style, the ABV and other characteristics stay perfectly in balanced.
A really quintessential beer in the style and it comes without pretension.

The nose and tastes have plenty of clove and banana notes, but the emphasis seems to be on the clove and spice elements. Some alcohol, but also a few medicinal phenols. The phenols are where this beer starts to deviate a little from authenticity. They don't grate, but the y do add a pepper note which although is not too unpleasant, does take it a little out of the genre.
The finish comes through with a little more fusel alcohol.

Nose is largely American IPA without much Belgian influence. The tastes do better, with a healthy dose of Belgian candy sugar and some yeast notes. Some metallic notes appear in the back end with a little coinage. The beer seems very dry to me, and the combination offers a bit of a battle of the senses which keep the beer interesting. There is some fruit, but it has a yeasty, fruit note like the slightly aging skins of black grapes. A bit of a musty note that's not funk, but is a little moldy.
Another interesting beer in the Lips of Faith series which keeps me interested. New Belgium has produced beers in the series that have varied between really good and really interesting and this one does not disappoint."

The pour is a very slightly hazed, pale orange with a frothy head with mid level density. Some lace.
The tastes are very fruity upfront. Some nice, sweetish orange and other citrus notes at the front end which turn into more bitter citrus notes (grapefruit) on the back end with little metal as well. The sweet and then bitter combo works very well and offers what I would call an internal contrast. The beer is VERY refreshing and feels clean and tidy to me, which, is often a trait with Full Sail.
The bitter, brightness comes through in the aftertaste, too.
Nice beer, good value and something I would recommend to those seeking a clean beer that offers a fruity bitterness. Well balanced and clean."

A very light touch of spice and pumpkin on the nose, but a bigger burst of pumpkin in the taste. With it comes a big blast of alcohol but it seems all in proportion.

An interesting collaboration, and on top of that an unlikely one. Green Flash are not exactly a subtle brewer (their existence in San Diego is unlikely to produce much of that), so I was concerned about their influence on a beer that would NOT benefit from a typical West Coast battering.
The beer is very highly carbonated to the point of being a little annoying. The corked pops with alarming ferocity and the beer pours all the way to the bottom of the bottle with a HUGE, semi-dense head. The one advantage is that it produces some of the greatest head retention and lace I have ever seen in a beer. The body is a perfect, light orange, honey hazed color which looks tremendous.
A big phenol nose is present, but to be honest it is well within parameters and sits well with me. It is tempered by fruit notes and some alcohol. Good.
This is a CLEAN beer, with very well defined edges and a fantastically hidden ABV. Some pineapple, lots of white pepper and very subtle, light spice. The finish is dry, bitter and warming with some alcohol, but before that point it remains restrained. A touch metallic, but nice.

Absolutely delighted by the concept of a SN beer that *should* reduce the hop profile to a lesser role, let's see if the beer manages to apply that theory to practice.
Nothing to complain about in the pour. A decent dark brown color (personally I'd like to see a little more red in the body but that's really a personal preference) with a nice, rocky, full head that lingers and produces some super lace. Good looking beer.
Nose and tastes do well to uphold the malt aspect of the Brown Ale. Whenever I see the style ""American"" Brown Ale I slightly cringe, since what that usually translates into is a Brown Ale that is over-hopped. To me, Brown Ales are one style that simply suffers when we start to add extravagant hop profiles, and given SN's ""house style"" this had warnings ALL over it for me. Personally I think there IS a little too much hop profile in the beer, BUT by SN standards, and by the standards on many American Brown Ales, I can live with it. A little toffee starts the beer and there is plenty of light roasted sweet malts to help it along. The finish and aftertaste seem to reflect a little too much bitterness for me, but to be honest it's short lived and fades pretty quickly. NOT a fruity beer, but still gives light touches and manages to stay away from jarring bitterness.
The beer does manage to retain an important quality of Brown Ales which is the moreish element. One is never quite enough so I credit SN for pulling that off.
So, we've managed to gt SN to dial back the hops and produce a very nice Brown Ale, now all we need to do is to take the ABV down to 4% so we can call this a session ale and it can take its proper place in the drinking rotation! That might be too much to wish for! All in all a success that should go well with some cooler weather."

Beer poured into a 10 oz glass looks much as expected. Jet black, but with a tan head that was a little smaller and less well-retained than other versions of this beer.
The combination of age and liquor element provides a beer that is astonishingly smooth. Virtually ALL the edges were taken off this and as a result the drinkability was incredibly high. For me the liquor and alcohol elements were almost completely missing, and they had been replaced by a velvet smooth creaminess. The only hint of alcohol was in the warming finish. Roast on the malts seems light, and overall the age has produce a beer with a light touch that kisses the palate. Very gentle drinking. Coffee elements have also faded, but this does not detract from the experience for me. A lot of sweetness and vanilla.

The beer poured an alarmingly cloudy mid-brown with some serious yeastiness. The keg must have been terribly unsettled, and it wasn't until the second glass that I had (about an hour after the first), that I felt I had a handle on this. (It settled down in that time).
The beer had lost it's hoppy edge in the barrel and it had turned into a much milder beast. Age and liquor turned the Big Hoppy Monster into a tamed beast, and it would be difficult to draw comparisons between this and the original version. That isn't to say that I didn't enjoy the beer, I did, it was smooth and easy drinking, but it wasn't just a slightly amped up BHM - it had changed. to be expected I suppose. Some vanilla, muted hops and sweeter than i remember, but the beer is at least interesting and offers a decent experience.

Pour offers up a clouded, well hazed orange body with some sticky lace and froth. Burnt marmalade in color.
Nose offers some fruit peel and perhaps a touch of spice but it's not strong.
The tastes deliver some more, biter citrus notes including a lingering aftertaste. Touch of alcohol burn and some bracing acidity are also there. Even though the beer is described in many places as a ""spiced"" Christmas Ale, frankly it lacks some of the typical spice notes for me. Rather, the beer seems to deliver it's very distinct character with lemons, oranges and grapefruits and a splash of sharp lime.
Some noble hop elements, more alcohol warmth and a light Belgian candy note round out the beer against the final flash of bitterness.
Complex beer - lot's going on and NOT typical of a ""spiced"" beer at all. Coupled with the the fact this is definitely ""pale"" or ""blond"" (Christmas beers often often much darker malts), this beer is a bit of a surprise but drinks beautifully. Highly recommended."

Nose and tastes produce a slightly yeasty, 100% non-offensive, light caramel malt and hop note which is pretty muted and reserved all around. Medium body. Attractive ABV to me, but lacks a lot of flavor to go with that particular subtlety.

Pour here offers a good, high head (deep and rich with a nice off-white color) that lingers. The color however, is a different matter - a turbid, murky, dirty brown that I don't care for. The color undoes the good work of the head IMO.
This is a VERY strange beer to me.
Firstly it does not look (or feel) like an APA at all. It seems to dark to me, and the tastes are odd.
This beer just seems overdone. At first the beer seems too malty. Then, in the next mouthfeel it feels too hoppy. It's as if there is a constant fight going on between the opposite ends of the flavor spectrum that never come to an agreement. there is conflict. It feels unbalanced to me, but in a way that I don't recall experiencing much. It's not that one element is too big, it's just that the character that is there seems to be in a constant battle with other tastes in the beer.
Many Rogue offering these days seem over-hopped to me and this beer goes a bit further and seems ""over-everythinged"". Odd beer, not good and so much so that the whole concept of GYO is completely lost here."

Tastes offer a similar balance to the nose, and the beer works nicely. It's definitely ""American"" in the manner that it does have some significant bite and hop presence, however the malts keep pushing back to give some decent balance.

I got to get a decent taste of this at a recent BA gathering in Charleston, but given the size of the pour and the amount of other beer being consumed I decided to pass on taking formal notes or writing a review, but I did make some mental notes. Then, a few days later, I unexpectedly got another chance to try the beer in a better light and make these observations.
Not much to report on the pour. Jet black with little or no head, motor oil appearance - not exactly shocking!
Nose gives up some pretty astringent alcohol and very little else for me.
The tastes were similar to the nose, and for all of my efforts to register as massive dose of coffee I simply did not get a big wave. The coffee for me was relegated almost entirely to the very back end of the beer, and to be honest it was a espresso note and not much else. The alcohol was there, as were some liquor notes and although prominent in each case I did not find them overpowering.
Considering everything, this was a pretty smooth beer to be honest, BUT definitely not as drinkable as the ""regular"" version of the brew. Small quantities (obviously), but the beer worked well, at least within the parameters that these things have to.
If you are looking for a coffee ""tasting"" beer then I don't think this is it. If you want a typical, VERY high alcohol sipper in the coffee/RIS/big/bourbon category then this will probably be for you. For me, too much going on to ever be a beer that I would actively seek out again."

Nose and tastes reflect one another with all of the usual dark, roasted malt and chocolate notes that one would associate with this kind of beer, but with the added hop element that one usually does NOT find in this style. Surprisingly green and grassy too which puts me off a little.
The hop note fades for me and leaves a touch of smoke in the rear of the beer which is more to my liking, and fits better against the overall package than a true hop note does.
An interesting beer with the green notes, since I would not normally expect such a trait to a beer of this style, but ultimately not really what I'm looking for. An increase n the smokey element would be fine for me, but somehow the resin note needs to e dialed back for me to get excited about the beer.

Nose has some floral notes and a does of medicinal, estery, phenol. Not strong but noticeable.
There is a fairly large hop profile for a beer of this type. Of course, that's not to say that it's remotely ""hoppy"" as such, but there is a little medicinal note that feels oily and hop based.

A little extra lemon and citrus as it warms and I go down the bottle.
Alcohol is well-hidden and only gives a tiny bit of warmth.
The beer does have a touch of cardboard (a typical musty note) about it particularly in the finish, but to be honest that may be related to its age. Without any dates on the bottle, it's difficult to know. It doesn't detract very much from the experience anyway.

The beer does have a slightly disappointing look in terms of head (or lack of it), even taking the ABV into full consideration.
The overwhelming experience here remains the toffee elements and the sweetness. On draft it seemed a little lighter than the bottle and the body was less intense. The outcome was that the beer became more drinkable in one way (in as much as you could drink MORE), but it a strange way less satisfying. For me, this is a beer where a more viscous, intense experience is better than a lighter, larger quantity. This particular beer works better as a liqueur-like experience.
Toffee dominates with some burned sugar in the finish."

The tastes give up the usual (and expected) malty, alcoholic bitterness. There is some white pepper (especially in the finish), and a little dryness in the back end. Maybe a touch of honey coming through in the sweetness. Finishes with some extra bitterness and a little mire alcohol.
Also, the mouthfeel produces the expected viscosity and syrupy nature.

There really is very little smoke in the nose at all, and what little there might be is overwhelmed with booze anyway.
The beer also lacks much smoke element in the taste, too. The first wave of taste is a large sweetness, but this quickly gives way to a alcohol burn and a bitter finish. A little charcoal in the back end too, perhaps THIS is where the smoke manifests itself.
The bee is fairly thin for the style and doesn't really hit the typical depths for the style. Still not much smoke for me, and it seems as though the beer substitutes a burning bitterness for the smoke.

Well, it needs to be said that this beer does not look like, or drink like, a Belgian Pale Ale. This is one thing that REALLY pisses me off. When a brewery puts the words ""Belgian Pale Ale"" on the label, it seems reasonable to assume that there is a Belgian Pale in the bottle - in this case there isn't, there's a beer that is much closer to a Dubbel, or at very least a Brune. It beer looks good as a ""beer"", but it looks awful as a ""Belgian Pale"".
Anyway, the pour is a dark brown with a creamy head that produces some nice lace and the cream is nicely persistent.
The nose and tastes are a combination of rich malts and a LOT of yeast - I mean a LOT of yeast. It's appealing in one way since the beer leaves you in no doubt about what its trying to do, but the strength of the yeast character is a little tiring toward the end of the bottle. It finishes with a touch of burnt sugar and more yeast. Also adds a dash of soap
Mouthfeel is rich and creamy which frankly is not the way a Belgian Pale should feel - it's nice, but a mess for the style.
What's going on here I cannot fathom. It's a tasty Dubbel, but it's a ridiculous BPA. This beer annoys me."

A lot of tropical fruit in the nose with an especially large emphasis on the pineapple for me. 
The beer drinks and tastes a little drier than the nose would suggest, but it still has a strong fruit note as opposed to any kind of wheat. The pineapple keeps coming and there is a touch of bitter aniseed in the finish. the bitterness could also be attributed to the clove element, but it's not very noticeable.
Despite the apparent lack of carbonation, the beer still drinks with a creamy mouthfeel.

Beautiful pour with plenty of fluffy white head that comes with good lace and retention. The color is interesting because it changes with the light more than most beers. In strong light there is a lovely, bright orange hue and in lower light it takes on a deeper, darker honey color. I like to see it in full light, but either way it looks great. It also exhibits a wide range of other orange shades between the extremes.
The nose gives a hint of the white pepper and alcohol that is to follow, but it gives very little of the herbal qualities that comes through in the initial tastes. The carbonation is just about perfect and lends of lovely, creamy quality to the beer which is a wonderful match for the style. More white pepper and the herbal flavors lend a certain bitterness to the beer that has a sweetness associated with the style.
To be honest this beer is a pretty herbal Tripel, so much so that it starts to touch upon the Saison area. A little more honey and a grassy herbal quality in the finish. The bitterness builds.
Super beer, well made and a pleasure to drink. You have to enjoy that slightly elevated herbal note, but if you do this is a beer for you."

Deep brown pour with a nice head. Not very good retention and no lace. Body has a few orange and rust colored highlights.
A barrage of sweet, bready malts in the nose and not hint of bitterness of alcohol.
The tastes still keep the malt based at the forefront, but add some alcohol and a little bit of bitterness to back up the idea that this is in the American end of the Brown Ale spectrum. Malts hold up well, and the alcohol never gets out of control.
In fact, the beer is pretty much EXACTLY what one would think of if you had to merge the ""Americanize"" and ""Imperialize"" a brown ale, so in that respect it's pretty much on the money. The debate as to whether a brown ale benefits from more alcohol and more hop character is a completely different one and perhaps left for another time."

OK, off the top I think the name is tacky. There, got that out of the way, now back to the beer.
Very light haze on the mid-orange pour. The body looks a bit like a cask pour. Not much lace as the beer forms a light, thin film on the surface which has some good retention.
The nose is very odd - it literally smells like cheese to me. Like a slightly overripe soft cheese - perhaps French. 
The tastes are a bruising assault on the taste-buds right off the bat, and to be honest it doesn't let up much. It's fairly abrasive and the abuse comes in waves of sweetness followed by a little bitter lemon peel and grapefruit. Not subtle (but then again who said it would be?), but it really attacks the mouth in a manner which screams Stone but lacks their usual skill. The cheese note also manifests itself a bit in the taste. There's some herbal, aniseed, nasty bitter notes in there somewhere, too.
On the plus side I do like the hoppy burps that it induces, and it does grow on you a little, but this is a poor beer by Stone's high standards.
After the absolute genius of 13th, this is a massive disappointment. A bitter, aggressive beer that lacks the Stone touch for pulling this kind of thing off. Edgy and very rough, the beer feels as though it's not yet finished.

The pour is a very bright orange color with a fizzy head that fades quickly to leave no lace but some thin film on the surface of the beer.
The nose is very strong. It's a sweet, citrusy, herbal mix with the emphasis on the herbs. This is something that I usually enjoy, but this seems unusually aggressive and wears a little.
The tastes reflect that nose, but here the orange-like citric notes come much more into play. There is also a soapy bitterness that manifests itself.
I don't actually dislike this beer, but to call it a Saison seems stretching it to me - it's just too bitter and has a weird, dark, gnawing hop presence which is out of place for me.
The alcohol warmth is just too great and the odd combination of flavors (pepper, lime and floral bitterness) don't sit very well together for me. It reminds me of getting a mouthful of shampoo when in the shower."

Then, as usual, all hell breaks loose with massive hysteria when news comes that Cantillon is/was will be/may be, NOT brewing this anymore. Cue panic buying and extreme geekery. I shrug my shoulders and content myself with knowing these just a huge amount of other, great beer that I can easily out my hand on.
....then, out of the blue, while visiting The Blind Tiger in NYC last Friday, there it is, on tap, right in front of me!
Poured into a small glass that was reminiscent of an Allagash White glass, the beer has a surprisingly bright orange hue with the usual cloudy body. To be honest, the cloudy body gives the beer a real depth, and it starts to look a little like a glass of orange juice. Th the extremities there is a little, watery lightness. Some delicate head and lace complete the picture.
The nose gives up very little to me, except a fresh, apple like acidity,
Tastes a re of some light fruit that I would not be able to recognize as a particular entity, but more than that the beer just has an extraordinary balance. It's tart, but very delicately so; it's fruity but in a very light way; it's also slightly sweet but in a manner that's lightly acidic. The combo certainly oozes class, as understatement is the watchword.
Insanely drinkable, and difficult to put down, and given the ABV this beer is really quaffable. The beer offers a really light touch all around without ever losing it's credibility or authenticity.

opening the cap gives me a gusher, and quite a profound one. It takes several minutes before the cascading, fine foam relents by which time maybe a quarter of the contents of the bottle are on the counter.
Poured in two separate portions into a 16 oz glass. The first pour gives a murky, yellow or butterscotch color with some good head. The head does fade rather fast though to leave some watery lace.
The nose gives an odd combo of light funk (unexpected) and some wheat notes. The taste reflect some of that, but also give a funky Belgian yeast taste and some alcohol sweetness - slightly Tripel like.
The second pour gives a much murkier body and as the yeast and sediment settles, some really NASTY looking green/gray particles. So nasty that I decided to drain-pour the last third of the glass rather than drink it. Normally I gobble up the yeasties but this really looked unappetizing.
Given the gushing, and the slightly funky tastes, I suppose it's possible that this beer COULD be a little infected, but it's difficult to tell for sure.

My first beer from Karl Strauss - excited to try it.
Pour is very standard for the style, with a high, fluffy and rocky head atop a slightly murky, mid-orange/brown body.
Nose and tastes reflect a very distinct fruitiness that seems like a combination of a number of things; grapefruit dominates, but you also get several other soft, tropical notes.
Well hidden alcohol.
One criticism for me is that the beer is a little muddled in the tastes. The tastes are good, but lack a clean, sharp edge which takes away some of the drinkability for me. If this could be improved a little, this beer would be really top class.
This beer reminds me a little of Coasts Boy King - it's not as good, but even to be mentioned in that manner is definitely a compliment."

Popped the cap on the 750 mL, usual style Bruery bottle (I do like their labels) and the pour is an impressive JET black! A few gold highlights at the extremities, but otherwise pretty solid. 
Carbonation is annoyingly fizzy. It detracts from the smoothness, leaves little or no head and the lace is basically nil. Prickly mouthfeel results which is bearable, but little more. Sits there looking like a Coke.
Nose and tastes are light, roasted malts with a hint of bitterness and licorice but very restrained and subtle. Alcohol too is subtle, and the beer drinks like a very mild stout or perhaps a watery porter. Not much Belgian character.
To be honest, the beer drinks a bit better than my last paragraph would suggest! There is a decent maltiness to it, and a bread character that I enjoyed. A hint of chocolate and dry cocoa and a touch of Belgian character comes through in the back end and finish, as does the slight bitterness.
In the end, quite tasty and glad I tried it, BUT the fizzy carbonation and subsequent mouthfeel were turn-offs for me. I think the beer is a bit better than my scores would suggest."

I've heard quite a lot about this beer over the years, and some of it I suspect has been simply because it has been canned; there seems to be a mild hysteria that accompanies some canned beers where people get ahead of themselves and forget to worry about what the beer actually tastes like!
Pour is a well carbonated, golden body with some decent head. the lace is not huge, but a decent, semi-thick film hangs around on the surface of the beer.
A strange, citrusy, lemon like smell that surprised me, but that I quite like.
The tastes are less impressive, with a malty sweetness that has a certain macro quality. Not good. Some soapy character (which I sometimes like but seems way out of place here) and a little bit of bitterness in the finish. I like the bitterness but it lacks a clean edge to leave me unhappy.
Clearly a beer that has been hyped because of the can angle, and is one that is not quite as good as people imagine."

A LOT of yeasty, bread notes in this beer that dominate both the nose and the taste. Excellent combination of sweetness and competing dark(er) dry character. Some fruit as well, the beer almost has a plum or other dark fruit note. In that respect it slides toward a Belgian Dark area, but never gets anywhere near that as the beer is light and very drinkable.
An amber, mid-brown aspect that is Dubbel-like.

I've become really wary of this series from Clipper City because frankly, the beers have been pretty poor. I'm a little more optimistic about this one though, since I liked the original Below Decks so there would appear to be some solid ground to build upon.
The pour is NOT attractive. A watery light brown with no head retention, lace or indeed much of a film.
Underneath this beer is a decent ENGLISH styled BW. Obviously if you are looking for a big, brash, bold, American BW with a large hop presence you not going to find it here, because Below Decks is not that beast. The sweetness and malt still make themselves felt and the Cabernet gives a definite vinous quality, but they sit a little awkwardly in conjunction with one another. A bit too much fusel alcohol in the finish which makes the beer harsher than it really should be considering this is an English styled BW.
Thinnish in the mouth, it ultimately fails to please.

Pour is a standard black, with some brownish highlights at the extremities. Head appears quickly but it is very ""fizzy"" and then it dies immediately. Coupled with the color, the beer looks EXACTLY like a freshly poured Coke - exactly. The head (or rather the lack of it) is rather disappointing and although the color is good but the overall appearance is not all that thrilling.
The nose gives a heap of sweet molasses and vanilla and a lot of rich, marzipan/almond based notes. Very attractive.
The tastes reflect some of that, and the tastes give a little more alcohol than the nose would suggest. Lovely, warming sherry like character in the finish and a gentle kiss of bitter licorice in the ending. Really tasty with some lovely brown sugar and delicate alcohol heat. Small amount of detectable evaporation on the tongue. The sherry adds massively to the experience for me. Some big, bold forest fruits and a healthy dose of rich, caramel based malt.
Scores are ALL over the place here. The appearance is a bit disappointing because of the apparently high carbonation for the style, but the color is good. The mouthfeel lacks depth and smoothness because of the fizzy carbonation, but the nose and tastes are both great. Drinkability is good too.
Nice, but for me the fizzy nature ultimately slightly detracted from what would otherwise be a stellar beer. I'd like to try this with some age."

Pour produces a beautiful color. A really rich orange and an excellent head with some sticky lace. Very nice to look at.
The nose and the tastes are one and the same and exhibit and extraordinary deep, clean and sharp hop note. The hop is, without question, a unique one and the cleanliness of it is what stands out for me. Overall the beer does exhibit a large, West Coat hop feel, but at the same time it seems incredibly light. Plenty of sweet malt adds to the mix and the beer seems really well balanced. I'm not a fan of rye at all, but to be honest it doesn't seem have much bearing on the beer.
Alcohol seems lower than 7.1% and the beer drinks very easily. I get plenty of citrus but it's much more tangerine than grapefruit. This adds to the drinkability.
I was a little wary of the potential for hype with this top 100 beer (#74 as I type), but to be honest in the end it pretty much delivered. Nice beer, and great use of the hops. Tasty and moreish."

Damaged cork pops out ALARMINGLY quickly ( http://beeradvocate.com/forum/read/2851950 ).

Mild, fruity acidity in the nose but nothing too ethanoic acid based.
Tastes are very gentle with the beer not really living up to its name. A nice, fruity, sweet and sour taste meets the palate but not a great deal of cherry taste. The bitter cherry skins do kick-in a little as the beer warms, and the carbonation is fine, light and pleasing. A touch more apple like acidity completes the picture. Smooth and silky with a lot of fine bubbles dancing on the tongue to stimulate the senses and add to the mild sour notes.
VERY drinkable, and very approachable. Not at all ""sour"" as such, more of a fine balance of flavors and sensations. Mouthfeel (gentle, fine bubbles) also a high point for me.

This is now a serious pattern rather than a few blips in the Big Beer series from Heavy Seas/Clipper. This is just not a very good beer - ANOTHER poor effort in the series.
Pour is fine with the standard black body and a decent amount of early carbonation. Head fades quickly; no lace or retention to speak of.
Nose gives virtually no smoke element which in itself is not an encouraging thing, but when the beer warms and there is only a tiny change and still no significant smoke it goes from disappointing to not good.
The beer offers virtually no smoke in the taste and there is a persistent acidity that I don't care for. A strange dry character afflicts the finish and the aftertaste is chalky and bitter. None of the cream notes that I would like to enjoy.
Drinkability is very low and the second half of the bottle goes down the drain. Poor beer IMO and the worrying thing is now that I've seen this in a whole succession of this series. They appear to be coming out at alarming rate with not much regard for the quality. Bleh."

Very unusual appearance. In a nutshell the beer resembles a Hefe in terms of the color. A hazy, orange, butterscotch affair with some fizzy carbonation. Head is small and not very well retained by does give some lace. Not what I was expecting at all.
Nose and tastes both threaten a big grapefruit attack, but both back away VERY quickly to give a lot of sweetness. The beer leaves a residual grain-like sweetness and it lingers. There's some sickly, honey like notes and a syrupy feel that gets a little tedious.
The alcohol, although hidden in terms of the taste, does start to accumulate and begins to tire the palate a little.

Always very excited to try a new beer from Brooklyn, especially one in one of my favorite styles.
The pour has a beautifully rich, butterscotch, lemon yellow hue, but to be honest the head, lace and retention are not all that great.
The nose delivers the lemongrass aroma as advertised. Quite attractive.
The taste is where things start going a little awry for me. There is no doubt that the Sorachi Ace delivers an absolutely unique taste, but to be honest I don't care for it much. There is a herbal and soapy quality to the beer that COULD be good, but unfortunately it fails for me. There is a distinct soap taste that some hops can deliver (I think of Courage beers from the UK from many years ago), but this LITERALLY delivers a soap taste which is not what I want. In addition, the herbal quality is not like that I've found in many other beers - it's a little grating and just way too floral.
I'm a little disappointed in this beer. Lots of potential, exciting to try, but in the end it just doesn't work for me. The Sorachi taste profile doesn't sit well with me. A good idea that just doesn't work with the taste buds.

Pour is the standard, deep brown almost black color with a small, coffee-like head that fades quickly. Not much lace, but that's OK, it's a pretty high ABV beer. Nevertheless, still solid looking. Quite acceptable.
Nose gives the expected sweetness, but the sugar tastes PILE on in a very harsh manner. Not really syrupy (which is the surprising thing, but sweet beyond all belief. WOW! I love sweet, malt based beers and I was expecting a pretty sugary brew based on the style, but this surpassed all expectations. Lots of molasses and honey and frankly not much else. The sugar gives a decent depth to the mouthfeel (full), but obviously detracts somewhat from the drinkability.
Interesting bee as it flirts with the style. An over-sweet Doppelbock which is a thing I wasn't sure was possible. As Ken Wolstenholme would say, ""It is now""!"

It's a pretty viscous and heavy beer, but to be honest, given the style that's in line and OK, but it certainly does not add to the drinkability. There's a little marzipan in the beer and the syrupy feel does gets a bit much, pretty quickly for me.
Lots of extra alcohol comes through in the finish and there is a mild burn. Sugar sweetness overwhelms the beer and there is a lack of bitterness that one would hope for in a beer of this style/type. I'd like a bit of extra bitterness and a less heavy feel to the beer, but ho hum. Mild burn in the finish too. Lacks the energy of a Sam Adams Imperial Pilsner for me.

Got lucky with this one. Brickstoredave gave a few of us a blind sample and I (like most others) loved it. I then proceeded to miss the very few bottles that came to GA. A week or so later, apparently a small second wave made it back to the state and I stumbled on to one - lucky me, this is a SUPER beer!
Pour gives lovely clarity from the bottle with plenty lively carbonation out of the bottle that subsides quickly to leave a thin film on the surface. Golden orange reminiscent of lucozade.
Nose gives a combination of mild acidity and mild funk but not hint of the peach juice.
Smooth. Smooth. Light funk, and the dry character is perfectly balanced - not too aggressive at all. Light fruit in the back that i would NOT necessarily associate with peaches, but nevertheless has a certain, mild ester note. Lots of typical, Somerset/Devon scrumpy stuff going on which is the way a great Wild Ale should feel IMO. Rustic and authentic. The apple cider notes increase, ad with them a lovely warming, volatile acidity.
As it warms and as one drinks more, it mellows out further and the beer becomes amazingly drinkable."

Beer pours with an impressive rocky, white head which gives some super lace. Body is a slightly hazed, golden pour with mid to low carbonation - a smashing looking beer.
Nose gives some typical sweet malts abut also a little white peppery bitterness.
The beer drinks very dry with a lack of malt presence for a beer in the English pale Ale category. There is a very stout, Saaz-like, crisp bitterness which gives a little pepper, and given the relative lack of malt character, I might have even guessed the style of this beer to be that of a Pilsner. The finish mimics the style too, with more lingering bitterness, a dry aftertaste and more cracked grains.
This is a pretty tasty beer with a lot of flavor packed in (take note you lower ABV beer bashers), but it's a bit strange for the style. There's a lack of malt presence which doesn't make it a beer that doesn't taste good, but it does make it a beer that is not really"

Blah, ultimately very disappointed consider the supposed gravity of this series.
The biggest problem here was the carbonation and general life associated with the beer - in the end nothing but flat and dull.
Pour was a surprisingly dark, mid-copper body with some large bubbles and a decent head. The problems started as the head faded, both quickly and badly. It left a brown; literally ""dead"" liquid in the glass which was flat and unappealing. All of this after a decent pop from the corked and caged bottle and some significant gun-smoke.
Nose and tastes gave a crisp, Saaz-like edge (which sat a little oddly against the color of the beer) and there was a good peppery, cracker feel about the initial tastes. The alcohol seemed to build though, and as it did the beer became heavier and less appealing. Coupled with the hard work associated with the body it really slowed the beer down. It got heavy and cumbersome very quickly. This beer was in STARK contrast to something like Rogues recent Maierfest offering which showcased all the great things about the style - this showed virtually none.

Pour is a touch on the light side of amber and also gives quite a lot of murkiness. Head is average, dissipates quickly and leaves a little watery lace. The head is not too much of a problem, but the color and lack of clarity give me a little cause for concern.
Nose has plenty of sweet malts and a little fruit.
The tastes reflect some of the nose but also have a touch of acid and some prickly carbonation. The light acidity seems to replace the hop bitterness that otherwise might be there. Dry finish where I would like to see some more, biscuit like malts.
It's OK, and I think has potential but to be honest I think this beer has some work to do. It's either got to up the malts make it a typical English ESB, OR up the hop character to give it a bigger American twist. For now it sits somewhere between the two and it doesn't quite make it."

Smells and tastes replicate a light yeast note with a touch of sweetness.
The beer is pretty well balanced and as such it *could* be a potential stepping stone for a non-craft drinker. However, the problem is really the ABV. Even though the alcohol is very well hidden, the beer still creeps up on you a little, and even though the alcohol does not necessarily manifest itself too much in the taste, it still comes through strongly in the effect. There's a little residual sugar too in a typical Belgian candy way. Strangely the beer still drinks easily with a light touch that does not get syrupy.
I like this beer, but the name, the time of year and the relatively light mouthfeel ALL demand a beer that is easier to drink, and on that note this fails. Anyway, tasty but a beer the ought to be easier to consume."

Very typical of the Rejewvenator series. Described on the label as half Doppelbock, half Dubbel!
A difficult to beer to classify but delicious and rich in malt just like the rest of the Rejewvenator series. The Shmaltz beers all seem to have a deep, richness about them both in terms of the color and the depth of flavor and this beer is absolutely no exception.
A nice, noisy pour with a very rich, reddish brown hue and a tea-colored head. The beer does not hold the head very well or create any lace, but based upon the ABV (8.2%) that's not too much of an issue. As it warms there are more and more caramel malts with a lovely, light marzipan background - delicious. Burned, light brown sugar with a touch of molasses too. Wow!
The beer is very vinous indeed. A sharp, tart sweet and sour combo with plenty of fruit and some yeasty character. there's a touch of bitterness in the back end and more grape character in the aftertaste. A little fortified wine character in there as well.
Extremely drinkable, very fruity and incredibly moreish. A sweetness that is pleasing and combined with the Belgian yest notes this is a VERY intriguing beer. Tasty and delicious, I want more!"

Pour is a very solid, jet black body with any initially large, light coffee colored head. Some lace is left along with a thin film on the surface of the beer.
The first few sips seem a touch on the bitter side, BUT after a few minutes of warmth and a few more sips the beer starts to take on the flavor profile that a beer of this style demands.
Some light licorice amongst the slightly sour cream like notes. Some more sweetness comes through with a few medicinal, bitter and herbal flavors. The herbal nature builds and becomes quite a prominent feature. Alcohol is well hidden and the finish is neutral (in a good way).

Clouded orange body with plenty of thick, yeast sediment coming from the depths of the bottle. Head is initially a high, white affair but it fades quickly to leave a thin film and a white ring at the edges of the beer.
There is a lot of fruit (pineapple especially) and alcohol up front as one would expect, and then there's a traditional white pepper note as well, but the finish brings that much greener, fuller, bigger feel that the peppercorn addition gives. It's a good combo and it works really well since the pepper has a naturally synergy with the style.
So, the beer comes together nicely, BUT the alcohol and taste combo just gets too much, too quickly.It's VERY hard work after the first 6-8 oz and the syrup, spice, fruit and alcohol just get too much for me. Two or three points down on the ABV scale would help, but for now it's just a bit too much for me to handle."

Nose offers a typical, west coast, hop-resin astringency. Not something that I care for necessarily, but definitely true to the style.
The beer does not stray much from the style with massive, astringent hops, slightly dry in the finish and plenty of grapefruit and oily, resin notes. In the end, very little to report. Alcohol is there too, but the beer remains drinkable.

Bright orange pour with a decent amount of cloudiness. Seems clearer on draught than from the bottle which adds extra haze. Nice, high, substantial white head.
In both cases I got a really decent amount of soap character in the taste. The hop presence seems to work up quite a big taste considering the style of the beer. If the soap taste is done right I really enjoy it in a beer; reminds me of the old days of Courage Best and Courage Director's. Finish is clean and reflects a touch more citrus (tangerine) than we found on the front end.
The beer is refreshing and satisfying at the same time.

Marketed in the USA as ""Scottish Session Golden Ale"" which seems VERY odd since the word ""session"" is so abused here. I don't get it at all.
500 mL bottle, nice label. Best Before Jul 2011 which seems odd given the probable, relative fragility of this beer.
Mixed feelings about this beer. 
Firstly I am absolutely delighted that we get a TRUE session beer (&lt;4%), and that it's called ""Session"" too. Label says 3.9%. On the other hand I shun the ""Golden Ale"" part of the name/beer. I've always though that the dawn of the English ""Golden Ale"" is really a reaction to dumbing down the traditional bitter, so in that respect I'm very much against it. Anyway, on to the beer in the glass.
Pour is a golden color with rather a lot of large bubbles present. Not much depth, and the head, retention and lace are not great. It's a touch thin in the mouth.
The nose has a sweet, malty start but also incorporates a surprisingly organic grassiness in the back end.
A LOT of flavor is packed into this beer, and anyone that thinks lower ABV beers do not have large flavor profiles needs to think again and taste this beer. Having said that, it delivers in an odd way that I don't necessarily approve of. The beer is shockingly dry when you consider the type of beer it is trying to be. There is a real lack of sweet malts, and it comes across as being quite ""hoppy"". Don't get me wrong, under NO circumstances is this a hop based beer per se, but the organic, dry, hay-like feel is surprising and prominent which takes away from the small malt presence even further.
Reminds me a little of an old-fashioned, ""Light Ale"".
Despite the slightly disappointing aspects for me, the beer is still hugely drinkable."

750 mL, corked & caged bottle, from September 2004, this was bottle #1466. Thick, heavy green glass with dimpled bottom. Substantial bottle.
Pretty much exactly as I anticipated to be honest.
The beer pours with a large amount of cloudiness and a significant amount of yeasty, floaties. Some carbonation seems to have dropped off (only a small pop on opening and it drinks with little life), but the head and retention are incredibly impressive with a really rocky, off-white crown on the brown body.
Nose and tastes come forward with some mild oxidation on top of what was once a really hoppy beer. The tastes have obviously become much less well defined and somewhat muddy, but for me that's often preferable to a massive, smack you in the face hop bomb. There is a fair amount of sweetness and the beer still packs a pretty decent alcohol punch. Some carbonation seems to have dropped off (only a small pop on opening and it drinks with little life), but the head and retention are incredibly impressive with a really rocky, off-white crown on the brown body.

The tastes are odd. The cherry obviously manifests itself, but to be honest it is simply a sour, ""beer gone off"" type taste. It's odd. I can't really work out if the beer is rancid, or if the cherry notes are indeed supposed to taste that way! Difficult to distinguish between the (potentially) good and the (obviously) bad. Weird.
A little more fruit in the aftertaste and the acidity drops off a bit.

Amazed at how light the pout on this is. No hint of any kind of blackness from a typical stout, rather the body is akin to a red or amber ale and lacks depth in the look. Head is minimal. Actually looks like cold tea.
Nose has a strong coffee aroma and the tastes reflect that. However, not much depth at all, and definitely quite light - even watery. Mouthfeel is correspondingly weak and disappointing especially considering this is supposed to be (apparently) an oatmeal version where one would expect some depth.

Roasty and dry in the nose and the roast continues in the initial tastes. Some light, teeth coating tannins come forth quickly with some alcohol in there too. SA little organic tree bark and a green, fresh hop note also present. Perhaps a touch of smoke in th aftertaste.
A bright beer that gives the impression of being drop-hopped. The oatmeal doesn't make its presence felt in the one place that you would expect - the mouthfeel. It seems to lack any depth considering the addition of the grain.
Bitterness lingers in the finish with some serious dry character - seems like a dry version of a stout in the back end.

Lots of licorice notes and quite a bitter twang in the finish. This comes after a more gentle start that showcases some simple, sweet malts quite nicely. Hop bitterness is quite restrained as the malts hold up well.The licorice really is the dominating factor here for me, and it get a bit medicinal in the finish.
This has the potential to be a really satisfying, sweet and refreshing beer but unfortunately the alcohol level really spoils it for me. It builds and builds and about half way through the bottle it feels like I'm drinking every single drop of the almost 9% beer. Would be better at half the ABV for me.

Pretty good pineapple, banana and clove in the nose and tastes with for me, the emphasis on a candied pineapple sweetness. It tends to build and get a bit tiring after a while, but tasty all the same.

After a few seconds of settling down, the pour gives a very suspiciously clear, macro-esque body and a head that fades badly. Despite the description on the label, the beer looks as though it has been filtered and in that respect it's horribly disappointing.
It's difficult to see how this beer creates much of a ""wheat"" effect at ALL. From the clarity of the look, to the lack of head and the largely watery body, the beer looks and drinks much more like a macro lager than anything else. Almost zero depth in the mouth.
Perhaps a touch of citrus freshness in the taste, but it is also muted to say the least. Corny taste in the finish. Reminds me a little of a Bud Lite lime - gulp!

Tastes are what I would call refined. A very tasty, noticeable light, citrus and herbal twang which come together very nice in the finish. Clean and a hint of more mixed, herbs, the flavors are floral and very aromatic. Very drinkable, thirst quenching and light. Light lemon finishes it off. A bit like a SERIOUS fruit beer.

Nose gives a sugary, malty, slightly liquor based aroma - not strong, but basically as expected for the style.

Delicious sweetness associated with a dark fruit, fig-based note that is reminiscent of the finest, dark Belgians. Moreish and slightly drying in the finish. Sherry comes again.
The only problem here is NOT the fault of the beer, but as an aged beer it has lost the mouthfeel, body and carbonation. I like my Baltic Porters to have some life, and the gain in beautiful oxidation notes has come with a price, but that's my fault for aging it. Mea culpa."

Nose has quite a lot of sweet peat, and then this is followed-up a LOT in the taste. Unfortunately the combination of light smoke (good), peat (also good) with an overwhelming sweetness gives a syrupy, difficult to drink cough medicine effect. The alcohol is also prominent and the combination gets way too much very quickly.
Even with this level of age the beer still seems ridiculously hot and gives a nasty burn on the way down. It's still a bit solvent like even after this time.
I just don't get a beer like this. By all means give the peat and smoke notes as big features, but why then bother with alcohol up near double digits? It just doesn't work well as a combination, and the kitchen sink approach here lets the beer down. What's wrong with a bit of balance or restraint?"

It IS true that the beer treads a fine line between a traditional Belgian Dark and a Stout (with the stout winning more often than not), but there is sufficient Belgian character to keep me interested. Finish is a little darker with some smoke and slightly bitter character that I could do without, but nevertheless it still works for me. Some dark fruits in there but the Belgian character is first followed by a drier, stout-like back end. Bitterness builds a little down the bottle and in the finish.
It's a bit like a cross between Unibroue Trois Pistoles and a light, American RIS. The fact that it says ""Belgian Style Imperial Stout"" on the label therefore seems very appropriate.

A little of the light onion that some others have mentioned, but nowhere near the amount that I was anticipated from some other comments. A little dryness and bittering in the finish, but considering the style it's all in check. Finish adds some citrus rind and the beer cuts a pretty clean swathe across the palate - AGAIN surprising for the style.
I must admit I was ready NOT to like this, but it was actually MUCH better than I was expecting and I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.

The tastes highlight and showcase the malts even more than the nose would suggest. The beer is really quite sweet and lacks much of a typical dry finish that is often associated with the style. As the beer warms and as I drink more, the sweetness seems to subside to give more bitterness, but the beer never gets aggressive.

What? I've never reviewed this? Seems unlikely, but here we go.
Pour is quite a light, orange color that one would perhaps associate more with an IPA rather than a brown. Head is decent, but retention is not great. Lace is present, but fairly wispy and not especially sticky.
Large caramel malts with also a (apparently odd) bourbon note! WTF? Anyway, in the taste the beer gets back to being ""normal"" with extra malt caramel and some rounded sweetness. A little touch of smoke for me (which again seems odd), but it meshes nicely.
The mouthfeel is VERY light for the style, and I guess one can view this either way. On one hand one might say that this adds to the drinkability, but on the other you could say that it makes the beer a bit weak for the style - I tend to go with the later. In the finish, that strange bourbon note pops up again in the aftertaste!
Frankly this is not a great beer and I generally don't drink this often, even though it is right on my doorstep."

Nice, authentic orange body with a good head initially but it fades pretty quickly. Not much lace either.
Light hops in the nose that are replicated with more force in the tastes. Quite sweet, so lots of malts must back up the hop profile. The alcohol is very well hidden and would not have guessed this was 7.00%. The finish also has some residual sugar. The malt base, the relatively low alcohol taste and the sweetness, certainly add up to this beer being on the English end of the spectrum.
Mid level carbonation is appropriate.

A high level of Belgian yest in the nose.
More yeast are the initial tastes. Plenty of alcohol and it warms slightly. Also the requisite white pepper but the alcohol comes back (along with the yeast) time and time again. Quite aggressive and upfront in terms of alcohol.

The beer delivers a decent malt punch and a little too much dry character that I really don't want in the style. The beer fades quite quickly and is easily forgotten. Decent malt tastes for the style with some dry notes that DO define it, but the lack of life lets me down. This would be a better beer if it were trying to be an American Red; as an ""English"" ESB it's seriously lacking.

Pretty much a quintessential American example of the style for me. Nice golden color with a decent head and some good retention and lace. In addition we get a nice golden color (important for the style), and a decent alcohol warmth that does not get in the way of drinkability. Now of course, the beer does creep up on you come the end of the bottle so the alcohol is still a feature.
Nice malts compete for your attention all the way through the beer. There is a touch of bitterness in the finish but the malts dominate in keeping with the style.

Pour is a golden color with a frothy, light head that although not especially well-retained it does produce some significant lace.
Nose and tastes create a feel of a Pils without the true Saaz-like kick in the back end. Some light, white pepper that for a second seems like we have a Belgian Pale note, but it fades and the bitterness does not figure.
Relatively light and easy drinking, but a beer that ultimately seems fairly pedestrian. Grassy notes are missing and beer lacks a certain crispness for me. Seems a bit lightweight all around to me.

Let's see.
Nice authentic color in the body with a deep, orange/amber hue. Head size is especially disappointing to me and the retention and lace should also be better for a beer of this ABV.
Nose reveals little, with a touch of fruit perhaps and some general, malty sweetness.
The tastes are too hoppy for the style IMO, and the bitterness certainly outstrips the nose in terms of what one might expect from the beers' aroma. Some fruit upfront with a hint oif traditional biscuit malts and also a pleasing (and surprising) soapy nature - that was especially pleasing. However, the fruit soon gives way to the finish which lingers and is quite a grapefruit centered, bitter affair. Also unfortunately, the beer has a bitterness that builds which is NOT what I want in the style, in fact I really rather want the opposite. This subtracts substantially from the drinkability for me.
Not a bad effort, but I'm almost completely resigned to the whole, ""high quality ESB"" thing not ever happening in the US."

Nose offers some light hop character, a bit of sweetness and perhaps a touch of Belgian yeast.
Tastes are reminiscent of the nose, but crank some of the aspects up quite a lot. The sweetness comes first, followed by the yeast and finally a really direct and assertive metallic bitterness comes in. The beer feels a bit too thin for me, and there are several examples of this style give much deeper (And better) interpretations for me.

Malty alcohol in the nose, not much else.
Medium carbonation greets the mouth.
The tastes are alcohol based with malty intentions but ultimately the beer drinks much like a toned down American Barleywine. It's nowhere near sweet enough to be considered an English version of the style, but on the other hand it's also significantly less aggressive in the bitterness/hop category to be condsidered an American Barleywine. Some of the other wheat wines I have had managed to distinguish themsleves as a seriously different animal in terms of style - this one does not do that, and it seems just like a very strong beer without much defining character or style.
More sweetness in the finish that makes the beer a little more mellow than the ABV might otherwise suggest.

The pour into the Terrapin snifter and gives quite a still body with a light, copper color with obviously no head or lace. Ultimately it looks like a brandy in the glass.
The nose has some alcohol but there is a feeling that the light solvent effect is mainly in the nostrils rather than the taste. A little acidic apple in the nose as it warms.
The taste is extraordinary in as much as the alcohol is enormously well hidden and there is none of the expected alcohol burn. In that respect the ABV on the bottle seems incredulous.
The tastes are sweet and smokey with an element of light tangerine. It's really quite amazing in its unique nature. VERY odd but I like it. Dry finish which is the way in which the alcohol manifests itself. The smokey, dry effect builds but it seems amazingly in check. More light fruit soaked in alcohol.
This is a CRAZY beer which I don't really understand at all. It delivers a bunch of gentle and subtle character but also comes in a 10.5%! Weird.

Smell is surprisingly non-hop based. Quite neutral without much hint of the tastes to come. Some sweetness.
Tastes are an offensive barrage of unsweetened grapefruit with the emphasis on the tartness rather than the bitterness.To be honest the beer did not drink as aggressively hop-tasting as I was expecting but it did have an astringent combination of sour notes amongst the hops. It is true that the hops did build down the glass. A little citrus based pine and a very unbalanced malt profile complete the picture - not good.
The beer quickly became very syrupy and thick in the mouth with a (literally) sticky feel around the glass where it had spilled.

22 oz bottle - silly label that does no favors for craft beer. (I agree with the Bros. comments in the mag about this).
Pour is an attractive, deep chestnut brown with some red highlights. Head is a mocha color with some decent retention and a little wispy lace.
Nose has the expected (but unwanted), fresh green hop note. Not much to say other than I don't want it, and it masks all of the malt notes and sweet nutty character that a brown ale should have.
Tastes reflect the nose, BUT the hop profile does NOT screw-up the sweet malts and nuttiness to the extent that the nose would suggest. In that respect it was better than I expected, although the green hop presence still takes much of the joy of the brown ale style away for me. The finish has a bakers chocolate/cocoa dry finish which I enjoyed.
Overall the beer is NOT the worst example of an American Brown Ale that I've had, BUT of course I really don't want significant hop features making all the good stuff (malts, sweetness and nut character) that I want in my browns. As such obviously my review is not especially objective so take it or leave it. However, as expected, not my cup of tea."

Sweet malt nose with some alcohol and some pale malts. The tastes reflect the nose and there is some decent viscosity about the mouthfeel, almost as if the beer is a lot higher in ABV. A good Bock will always give you a slightly syrupy note and an alcohol presence that definitely holds its own, and this is no exception. Some light apples and acidity upfront and a crisp finish put together a pretty nice, thirst quenching package that drinks every bit of its 7%.

The brew exhibits all of the classic American Barleywine characteristics along with the way that one normally expects them to change over time. Plenty of slightly faded, hop forward aggression with little malt backbone to hold them up; a lot of hop bitterness and plenty of alcohol still present to drive the whole beer deep into the palate.

Pour is as expected with a dense, slightly off-white head that has pillow-like character and a hazy, orange/golden body. Solid looking.
Nose and tastes combine in a rather unusual way to bring the best of Belgium with that, typical slightly over-hopped American influence. Tangy orange, light yeasty spice and then a sprinkling of bitterness thrown in for good measure. Belgian IPA-esque I suppose.
It's really a competition between the yeast notes that one expects in a range of Belgian based beers like Saison's, Farmhouses and Pale Ales, and the West Coast, American hop influence which undoes some of that good work. To me, I don't feel as though the two complement one another, and in the final analysis I think I'd prefer beer that firmly came down in one area or the other.

Pour is a surprisingly light, cloudy, orange color that is reminiscent of tea. I was expecting a dark, black cheery color which would fit with the advertised fruit and the quad categorization. Not much head and little or no retention.
Nose gives some fruity notes, but they are not strong and definitely not obviously cherry based.
The color confused me a little as it was not remotely dark enough to be considered typically quad-like. The tastes are also VERY fruity (although virtually zero discernible cherry) and reminiscent of a triple. The alcohol is present but not especially strong and again is triple like. There are some pears and light pineapple which again point to triple, not quad.
I guess what I'm saying is two things. Firstly this is essentially a triple, and secondly it has almost zero discernible cherry flavors, but IS very fruity.

Firstly, the style or name ""Black IPA"" is ludicrous and I am glad that American Brewers Association agrees with me and calls this type of beer, ""American-Style India Black Ale""! Anyway, back to this particular ASIBA!
Pour is a dark, dark chestnut (bordering on black) brown body with a lovely, creamy, thick mocha head. A few orange/red highlights at the extremities which are enhanced by the tapered glass that the beer sits in. An encouraging, ""noisy"" pour which suggests good body and creamy depth. Decent head retention and some above average lace. Looks great; so far, so good. 
Nose reveals some deep, resinous pine, and as is usual with the style this starts to confuse the senses as the eyes see one thing and the nose sees another - I don't like the confusion, but that is not a function of this particular beer rather a problem with the style in general.
Initial tastes reflect the pine nose, but this beer changes quite significantly as it warms. The malts really do come into their own and there is even a hint of chocolate that comes to the fore to compete with the hop bill. A little roastiness as one would expect with a licorice hint. For me the hops are simply way too aggressive and although they are tempered in the middle of the beer, they come back to haunt the aftertaste in a very, very aggressive manner. The aftertaste is bitingly bitter, and not in a good way. Alcohol is well-hidden. I'm just not sure that this malt bill can hold up the resin-based hop profile.
The mouthfeel is that of a classy brown ale, with great depth and a lovely creamy texture, however all of that good work is undone by the astringent bitterness that bites back over and over again. Along with the look, the mouthfeel is definitely the beers' strongest point, but because of the unsubtle bitterness the drinkability is really pretty low for me.
I dunno, this is an extremely difficult style for me to get into and my review WILL reflect my general dislike of the combination rather than (necessarily) that of this particular beer, however I'm always upfront in saying that my reviews are not 100% ""to style"" and have my own preferences and subjectivity built in, so you can take it for what it's worth. To be fair, I disliked this beer much less than some others I have had in the same style so I suppose you could call it a triumph in that respect!
I would imagine if you can stand the (what seems to me) unbalanced bitterness, and you enjoy this style you might really like this beer, but for me it's a bit of a non-starter in terms of actually sitting down and drinking it. This would be so much better off if it were tweaked to be a straight up brown ale of even a porter. I understand that would negate the whole point, but nevertheless that's what I leave with at the end of the bottle."

The initial tastes enhance the fruit and the beer comes through as sweet which denies the ""Dry Hopped"" text on the label. A LOT of pineapple and other sweet tropical fruit come through as well, but the finish is surprisingly dry considering the nose and sweet fruit angle that hits the palate initially.
It's a little confusing to me as to what a ""Belgian Pale Ale"" is. Is it a Belgian Simple, or single, is it a watered down Belgian IPA, is it an American version of a Belgian Ale? Dunno.
Confusing beer that is solid and drinkable but I'm not really sure what Ommegang was reaching for here. I'd like to hear more from the brewers on this one."

I got really lucky as my wife was in Hilton Head when the Boy King was tapped at The Lodge - one growler = $19.
Growler opens with a pleasing ""phhssst"" which gives me confidence - you never know how well the growler was filled or how it will hold up over a couple of days. This one seems perfect.
The nose up front is really quite strong with a hop-laden tangerine citrus coming to the fore. The aroma is pretty interesting because as the beer warms a little the fruit intensifies but the smell seems to become increasingly malty and less hop-dominant.
A hazed and clouded amber/orange with degrees of color down the tapered glass, the beer has an Olde English Marmalade look about it in terms of hue. Head is light but full, leaves excellent lace, and has nice retention but is less ""sticky"" that some DIPA froths.
EXTREMELY well balanced with a malt presence and backbone which MUST be one of the largest ever encountered in an American DIPA. Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of west coast style resin and pine in the middle and back-end of the beer, but the start is very, very malty for the style and this rounds out the aftertaste too - very unusual and subtle aftertaste for something in this style. Mild bitterness but not palate wrenching. There's even a touch of unsweetened bubblegum in there!
Extremely drinkable, and although I wouldn't say that the alcohol is nowhere to be seen, I would say that it is quite subtle and very understated in terms of the taste. It does not manifest itself in the 9.5% range! As a result, take care, this beer could clearly sneak up on you and bite you pretty hard.
I score this beer pretty highly, BUT this is really interesting because if you are a SERIOUS hop-head I don't think that this will quite cut it for you. In that respect it's an interesting DIPA and a beer that will appeal to those of us that like a hop blast but still demand balance. Some American drinkers shun such balance so, in time, we should get some mixed reviews on this one. I'll be watching with interest."

Classic, black pour with a few reddish highlights in the strong light. Head is thick, well formed, offers excellent retention and some nice lace. Creamy head.
The nose gives a distinct oatmeal aroma (even though the beer is NOT an Oatmeal Stout) - Glenn (the brewer), suggested that this could be due to the flaked grain that was present in the beer. Unfiltered to protect the roasted flavors from being diluted (again according to Glenn).
Light roast (to me there was virtually no coffee depsite the fact that Glenn suggested there may be), but with some really gentle and rounded fullness. Very non-aggressive (hooray) a really simple, well rounded and drinkable stout. Glenn said it weighs in at around 7% (I think).
Medium body with enough presence to make itself heard, but with plenty of light subtlety to make you want to come back for more.
A light touch on this beer without it ""being"" light. Very drinkable and a very nice beer all around."

Appearance is a nice golden clarity with a billowing head, but the whole package seems a lot flimisier than regular Duvel. Much wispier head, and talthough the lace is good the retention is not great. Well carbonation, even feeling a little ""fizzy"" at times.
Lots of dry, light spice which seems to dominate the sweetness a little more than I was expecting. Very light drinking, and it's a pity that the ABV isn't a few notches lower; if it were it would be more drinkable.
There's some light grassy notes (not exactly hop based but they do feel green) and nature to the beer too which added to the fresh, drinkability.

Sweet nose and tastes which reflect the style pretty well. Plenty of sweetness to back up the aggressive hops, this beer is surprisingly simple but good. Large hop presence in the finish and it provokes some nice burping - a good sign for me.
A little light in the mouth, but still performs well overall.

Nose is true to the description of a Saison with Brett, but quite mild. 
Tastes reflect the nose with a lemongrass note on top of the Brett and some more pronounced bitter, funk in the finish. Carbonation lingers for some time as well. Light mustard also makes an appearance with some timid acidity.
Mouthfeel is excellent and the beer is easy drinking.

I suppose it depends on what you are looking for at any one particular juncture. If you want a macro-colored, well carbonated, sweet lager brew with some veggie highlights and some mild cereal, then this will fit the bill. Otherwise it will not work well for you.
Dark straw colored body with typically large initial carbonation that fades fast. No lace, poor retention. Nose and tastes are of the aforementioned mild, cereal sweetness and largely non-offensive.

Tastes reflect the nose but bring some dry character and a little alcohol. The dry character is quite a surprise by it merges well with the malts and produces quit a bit of depth. There seems to be some fruity notes amongst the other competing flavors and it drinks with a certain crispness which may be a function of the dry notes that come through.

Impressive pop from the unusually shaped bottle that is corked & caged. Some gunsmoke. Presentation is classy, including the label.
Pour is definitely intense-black with a large head at first but it fades away. Not much lace and a thin film is left on the surface. A little disappointing in the head department, but given the ABV not all that surprising. Having said that, I've seen similar strength stouts with much better retention and lace.
A little bit of roasty licorice in the nose but it's not that big. Surprisingly very little solvent alcohol - a good thing in my book.
Tastes reflect some of the light roast but there is a larger smoke element for me. The surprising thing is the manner in which the alcohol is hidden. Very little burn or presence. The roasty bitterness builds a little down the bottle and in the finish.
Well, at least it wasn't over-hopped! Outside of that a little too simple IMO for a signature event. Not a bad beer, but to be honest i was really expecting a LOT more. When SN gets out of AIPA mode they can sometimes struggle a little to define themselves."

The nose has a surprising level of green hop presence. Really quite strong.
Tastes are a little mixed where the hops fade from their aroma level but still hang around, and then the malt bill kicks in. It still remains quite ""organic"" and green in its' feel. The beer definitely drinks MUCH more like an American Brown Ale than an American Strong to me, and that's my problem. I want Brown Ales to be sweet and malty and I don't like the hop presence to be high. It doesn't still all that well with me.
I don't like this beer very much as there is an odd, unhappy marriage of a beer that basically should have a low hop-profile, with a huge, green hop note - odd and unbalanced for me. It's NOT actually a very hoppy beer, but the combo just doesn't work for me."

Great color and clarity on the pour, but let down by a disappointing head with poor retention and lace. The color is VERY red, and my guess is that this really is an Irish Red rather than an English Pale (as currently categorized in the BA database)...anyway...
Nose has some simple malts and the tastes are also very malt based with a dry finish. Hop profile is unsurprisingly low and the beer drink easily. Lots of complexity from the malt bill and a pleasingly simple beer that we see not nearly enough of in the US. What little hop character we do get comes with an English edge.

All in 750's, all corked and caged and all $7.99. Reliably informed that these beers are bottle conditioned with champagne yeast. Opening the bottle backs that up with a BIG, impressive pop. Pour also suggests massive carbonation with an ice-cream, fine bubbled head on top of a murky, orange body. Looks good.
The head IS impressive but fades surprisingly quickly to give a complex but light, lace pattern.
Nose is a little grainy with some macro, adjunct characteristics. It seems like some highly carbonated malts.
Tastes are surprisingly neutral and although there is some bitterness, to say that this beer has any kind of noble, Saaz like hop bite would be a bit of a stretch and as such the German Pilsener moniker seems optimistic to me. Much more like a highly carbonated, Euro Lager in my book. Nevertheless, not really a problem as the beer drinks nicely with a simplicity and (the best part) a lively carbonation. A few earthy notes especially in the finish.
The carbonation is probably the best features and is enjoyable and perhaps hides some other shortcomings. I could see drinking this in large amounts at a summer wedding!
Without the carbonation a pretty ordinary beer, and not such of a Pils, however it was non-offensive and in the regard I didn't dislike the beer. Not bad value either."

Mid brown body that sits nicely in the Brasserie de Abbaye des Rocs chalice with a lovely, frothy light tan head. Some lace.
Nose is surprisingly neutral to me (even with warming) and gives only the slightest hints of sweet malt, a touch of alcohol and some sharp carbonation (yes, carbonation in the nose!)
Taste start to reveal more of the dark fruit, BUT the taste remains quite distinctly ""unsweet"". A definite authenticity about the fruit, by that I mean it seems natural and NOT artificially sweetened. n that respect it seems quite different to a Belgian-grown version of the style. Also the alcohol is missing, in as much as it seems less boozy than many Quads.
The finish is very interesting to me. It gives a bitter note that is often missing in the sweeter, Belgian originals. For a moment it feels like almost a hoppy edge (which i feel would be out of place), but it pulls back from that particular edge and comes crashing in with the plum skins. Tannin and light, natural bitterness are very prominent which is an interesting touch. Almost a sweet and sour ending, but ultimately a pleasing, bitter dry edge.
A lovely beer, BUT be warned, the sweetness and the alcohol ARE muted for a typical Quadrupel. The good news is that those attributes are replaced with some authentic, bitterness from the dark fruit which seems like it emanates from the skins."

Nose is a hop based one but is light and reminds me of an anesthetic - think a visit to the dentist.
The tastes are nasty bitterness upon nasty bitterness. Not subtle and not roasted, rather it tastes like a piece of licorice that was constructed by a 10th graders chemistry set. Bitterness lingers and leaves a dry unhappiness in the mouth. Mouthfeel seems light and weak. 
Medicinal hops complete the package and the beer seems like a herbal mix of homebrew and vitamins.

Pour is a murky, unattractive iced-tea like affair with a very poor head and as a resut little retention or lace. Body is an ugly, rust color that does not invite one in.
Carbonation is a little on the high side which gives the beer an off, fizzy sensation - again, not good.
Initially the tastes seem OK with some yeasty malts up front and some decent sweetness, but pretty soon it gets a bit acidic and thin. At first it seemed like this was going to drink something like a Gordon Biersch Marzen, but pretty quickly it declined into an acidic beer that gave me a little heartburn. In the end the sweet and sour effect did not save the beer and I was disappointed.

Lemon is very strong for me. the label suggests a ""hint"" but to me it somewhat overwhelms the beer and it certainly does a number on the wheat aspect of the brew. For this reason i found the beer difficult to drink and wondered why they felt it necessary to drown the wheat, out.

My worry with all beers that start life in the USA and claim to be ""English"" style, is that we will get over-hopped products with alcohol that is too high and malt profiles that are insufficiently developed. This beer confirmed my reservations on two of those but did better on one.
Decent copper body with good clarity and a nice white head that is well retained and leaves good lace. The appearance was the strongest suit in this beer for me.
It's clearly too high in ABV to put it into ""sessionable"", but that's where beers of this nature really need to sit. The hop profile was sufficiently muted (good), but the biscuit malt intensity to accompany that was missing and ultimately disappointed.

Poured into the Terrapin snifter the beer ultimately settles to take on the appearance of a cognac. Still, light copper colored body with zero hint of head or lace. Strange since it suggests a MUCH higher ABV.
A lot of brown sugar and alcohol in the nose. This gives way to some massive bubble-gum highlights in the mouth and finishes with plenty of warming alcohol.

A super beer that captures a lovely combination of the lactose sugar and mild sweetness that come together in the way that a sweet stout should, i.e. as a welcome, refreshing antidote to the incessant onslaught of a roasty bitterness that we find in so many American stouts (both RIS and ""regular"").
The sweetness is really reserved and generally I prefer it to be a bit more advanced in my Milk stouts, but this still drinks beautifully.

Pour gives a standard, mid brown IPA-like body but some excellent, thick, frothy head and lace that lingers. Solid looking.
Nose gives a very distinct rye whiff right off the bat, and this builds even more with increasing temperature.
The tastes do the same, with the spiced rye building over the course of the beer as the hop presence takes a bit of a back seat as the temperature warms. The spiced nature of the malt really doesn't give one a break from the bittering angle and the beer gets difficult to drink in any kind of quantity for me.
I'm generally not a huge fan of rye beers, but this one was OK. It's difficult for me to get really enthusiastic about them though, since I find the combination of a spicy, aggressive malt alongside the hops to give me a little too much of an assault on the palate. This gives the beer a combination that reduces the drinkability for me, but that is really a personal preference.
Hard work for me in this quantity and probably a good beer for the rye loving crowd but not one for me."

The nose gives up some alcohol and a very strong herbal, spiced and medicinal note.
Tastes are somewhat bizarre. At first the beer seems like liquid licorice - literally! After that we get varying amounts of pepper, MORE licorice, medicinal herbs. Then comes a serious wave of aniseed bitterness which ultimately is the distinguishing taste. Aniseed is the final flourish and the has the final word. Light alcohol burn. Very odd.
Mouthfeel is quite lively.
A licorice aniseed BOMB!
I dunno, it seems like Nogne are getting increasingly distracted by the American influence of doing weird stuff and for me it's not working. It's just getting a little too quirky and bizarre and the experimental nature of the brew seems to be overtaking the taste - ""crazy"" is often not ""good""."

Pretty interesting beer to say the least that pushes the boundaries of what I'm comfortable with.
Pour is an usually dark color for a Saison and takes on an orangy, peach hue with significant cloudiness. Looks like sweet tea. Head is good initially but becomes spotty quite quickly and lacks much retention or lace.
The nose is aggressively floral and estery with massive pear, peach and pineapple notes thrusting through the nasal passages. This is NOT subtle and really gets a little too much for me quite quickly - and this is coming from someone that tends to like this kind of big fruity aroma as well.
Tastes follow the nose with a non-too subtle arrangement of the aromas coming together with a slightly medicinal edge as well. A definite sweet and sour effect takes over and the beer is a touch syrupy as well. Slightly building alcohol too.
This is NOT a clean, bright, fresh, vibrant Saison to me, rather it is a heavy going floral package that is better in smaller doses. Do not expect a simple beer either, there are some complex bubble-gum notes and heavy sugars that remind me of a Doppelbock or large Weizen (oddly). Starts to round out with some more alcohol and further peach and flowery characteristics.
Odd beer, and one which I'm going to have to re-visit before I actually understand."

Dark mahogany pour that produced a pretty good head considering the age of the beer, the style and the ABV. One of the most distinct parts of this beer (at least visually) were the legs.
The aroma is quite complex with a fairly large dose of vanilla. As Gregg pointed out, you could certainly detect a sort of old, musty hop note in the aroma too.
Smooth and warming in the mouth and a mild burn on the way down. Definitely manifests some more alcohol in the mouthfeel.
Tastes are light alcohol with some nice liquor like notes up front. It finishes with a chocolate like note, but it's not a stout like, smooth chocolate taste but much more like a semi-sweet, bakers chocolate. A bit of cocoa too. The baker's chocolate brings a seriously dry note in the finish that was surprising. It's a complex beer but the sum of the parts is not stunning for me, rather just very solid. Despite the alcohol in the nose it is well hidden in the taste (at least relatively).

The mouthfeel and some of the tastes (and indeed the look) remind me quite a lot of Duchesse but obviously significantly sweeter. There's a certain quality about this beer which makes it feel slightly old and musty, almost as if the bottle has been hanging around for an extended period of time. I've noticed this with one or two other examples of the style and I'm beginning to think that this is basically a feature of beers like this one.
All in all this is not a beer (or a style) that really captures my attention and as such this will be a very infrequent visitor to my table. Nevertheless delighted to have tried it."

I wouldn't go as far as to say that I ""like"" this beer, but what I will say is that it pretty much nails the style. Now, whether or not you consider that to be a good thing is a different question, but I suppose we should offer some credit!
Black pour with some significant orangy/red highlights. The color is fine bu the beer is quite badly let down by the lack of persistent head - it dies in the glass very quickly.
Obviously a sweetish, malt based beer with not much hop presence (if any) at all. Very malty all the way through with little other clear flavors. Perhaps a touch of bittering licorice but that's about it. Some residual sugar on the tongue.
Finishes a tad musty and one is plenty."

Recent addition to The Bruery line-up in GA.
Pour is a resplendent, butterscotch yellow with a creamy looking white head that looks dense. 
The nose has some light Brett that does not really manifest itself in the tastes which suits me just fine! In fact, I'm happy that it does not come into the picture too much in terms of the palate. the nose is further enhanced with some serious Belgian yest character. VERY nice.
The mouthfeel is a VERY strong part of this beer. Deep and creamy in its nature, it manages to pull off the look that the head suggests. 
The tastes are all about a very light touch, and the Brett is so reserved that I would go as far as to say that this drinks much more like a Belgian Pale and less like the Saison that it claims to be. Not a great deal of funk here at all, but some light grapefruit and plenty of yeasty character. There's also light lemon and some classic white pepper on the tongue too.
If you are looking for a Brett infused beer, forget it. This drinks like a slightly hopped Belgian Pale, perhaps even putting a single toe into the Belgian IPA pool. Either way it is subtle and enormously drinkable. A classy beer that transcends a lot of nonsense and gets right down to quality and drinkability in a couple of easy steps."

Poured from the 22 oz bomber the body is a lightly hazed, light copper color. The head is light and fluffy but impressive in terms of retention and lace. Bone white.
If the truth be told this is a very simple beer, but well constructed and the kind of thing that could easily be overlooked. Careful attention will find an easy drinking, well built American IPA that should garner respect.
Malty and bready nose and upfront tastes are followed by assertive (but not aggressive) hops to complete the picture. Clean, light grapefruit notes finish the beer.
All in all simple and that's a good thing."

Surprisingly golden/orange pour with good clarity - like a little like a Tripel in terms of color. Head is minimal and limited to sticky film on the surface of the beer and some creamy bubbles at the edges.
Nose gives quite a lot of sweetness and a hint of medicinal hop character but not much.
Tastes have some chest warming alcohol and more sweet candy notes but a lack of any great hop presence. To me this drinks more like a Tripel than anything else with some light, white pepper and some lemony spice. Hops are there, but are very reserved, perhaps manifesting themselves most strongly in the aftertaste and finish. Dry in the final flourish.
Quite a thick, syrupy mouthfeel too which once again takes me to Tripel thoughts rather than Belgian IPA.
Drinkable and tasty, but a beer that is sweeter than many other Belgian IPA renditions I have tried. Much more like a hopped-up Tripel to me."

12 oz single. Pour is a dark brown/black Porter like affair. Little lace other than a touch of spotty character on the surface. Obviously the ABV impairs any significant head or retention. It ultimately dies to just about zero carbonation which is OK.
Nose is an extremely rich, sweet. liquor based aroma. Some alcohol but not overpowering at all. The liquor element is prominent. Obviously some good alcohol legs. The alcohol manifests itself with even more sweetness.
A very sweet rum infused assault is the start on the tongue. The molasses and licorice are certainly there, but they combine to give a slightly smoky charcoal bitterness and the rum like sweetness still continues to shine through. Slightly bitter, dry aftertaste and with it the slightest hint of hop character - VERY slight! 
One might describe this as a poor man's Utopia's (after the initial carbonation has gone) as it tastes and drinks in a very similar manner.
If you don't enjoy a sweet beer you'd better stay away. Certainly a pretty extreme brew and a beer that is in a bottle about twice the size it needs to be, but still a pretty interesting beast - In fact it reminds me a little of Avery's The Beast! Drinkability is not great, but that's really a given for a 12.5% beer.
In the end, fine, but 6 oz every six months would be too much for me."

Pour has a somewhat uninspired color (a hazed, light brown/orange) but better than expected head, retention and lace. Quite sticky and more in line with a higher ABV IPA.
Nose and tastes are in the English style, but both are less fruity and drier than one would expect. There isn't really the depth of biscuit malt that would would normally associate with a true English Pale and that takes away some character for me. The dry character builds and this beer does not have the malts that are really needed. Conversely it has a pretty low hop profile too, and the combination makes it a touch too light for the style in terms of flavor; the depth is just not there. There is a very light (almost diet) grapefruit in the back end.
On the plus side very drinkable and hit has a clean edge that makes it drinkable if a touch light in the mouth.
Not a great example of the style, but these days if get a beer less than 5% from an American brewery I feel somewhat happy, anyway!"

Pour is an exquisite looking, beautiful red garnet color with a tan colored, rich head. Looks excellent with maximum red/copper highlights catching the sun.
Nose and tastes combine in the way that they should for the style with a significant yeast not amongst the deep, repeating, rich malts. Very good depth of flavor. Tastes are caramel based with a persistent nod to the yeast. Finishes rich and bready. Some alcohol too.
Superb example of the style (in an American sense) and a very nice addition to the GA scene. Solid beer with excellent drinkability. 
Very strong (in a solid sense not a ABV sense) beer."

Presentation is great with the green gold and white label adding a classy touch to the beer. The paper is a little higher quality too, with that slightly textured, cotton effect. Bottled on Oct 23, this is a 2009 vintage.
Pour is a beautiful, rich, yellow golden body with a nice, bright white head. Lace and retention are very good. Smashing looking beer.
Nose has light straw amongst the mild funk and barnyard notes. Some slight lemon zest but it's pretty reserved.
Tastes seems more funky than the nose would suggest at first, but this backs down fairly quickly to even out to a moderate funk. Dry notes in the finish with a nice, and surprising champagne like carbonation at the back end. The tastes manifest the orange peel more and more with an increasing note of bitterness amongst the horse-blanket. 
Very clean and dry but still manages to compliment those attributes with sufficient citrus fruit pith and zest to keep it all together. Overall the emphasis seems to be on the Farmhouse side of things rather than the Saison.
A beautifully constructed beer which reminds me a sweltering hot European continent summers and optimistic spring days. There's a lot of character about this beer which screams France and Belgium to me, and makes me yearn for some Gite and street cafe time. Delightful beer that catches my imagination."

The label on the bottle is obviously amateurish which is probably a combination of deliberate style and cost consideration. Either way it looks like it was done by a freshman art class.
Pour is a little odd with a clouded butterscotch appearance that was mildly reminiscent of a Hefe or other wheat beer. Strange. Head was poorly retained though and the lace was watery.
Nose was a nice combination of sweet malts and some citrus based volatiles.
Tastes are quite frankly bland. The zesty nature of the nose is not transfered to the taste with any authority and there is a prickly mouthfeel that seems a little out of place. No offensive so the drinkability does not suffer too much, but this is the kind of beer that I could only appreciate if I was really dying for a beer. I thought it tasted like something I could make in my basement without too much difficulty. Again it seems ""wheaty"" to me.
Strange beer and unlikely to be visited again by me."

Murky, honey orange pour with a thin film of wispy foam on the surface of the beer. No head and no retention. Some viscous legs greet the eye too.
Nose has some extremely large vanilla sugar notes - very big.
Tastes have some bourbon character that builds. It's not an especially aggressive beer in terms of the depth, and to be honest it melds better than I was expecting. This is not a beer that I would normally enjoy but this works relatively well. There's some spice flavor which seems to temper the alcohol a bit. In fact, the alcohol is quite well hidden.
Increased vanilla as the beer warms but it never gets sweet. Some bitterish honey notes (presumably from the maple) that manifest themselves in the finish.
The mouthfeel is especially viscous and syrup-like and although entirely appropriate given the style and the ABV, it remains as a prominent feature.
Better than expected for me, but still strictly a one-off in my book."

Murky yellow pour with not much head, lace or retention. 
Nose has a really fruity, very lemony clove and banana note. Tastes very bright despite being a little past the Best By date and the fruit does not manifest itself quite as strongly as it did in the aroma. We get some more light acidity and some more banana with a tangy edge.
More brightness and wheat inthe finish and aftertaste.
Drinks very easily and I'd imagine fresh and on draft this beer would be a big hit with. Although not exactly in the same league it reminded me strongly of Live Oak! That's very high praise."

The pour was like a nitro, with plenty of those minute bubbles of carbonation that produce a tight, creamy and lasting head. Simple brown coloration - very clear. Aroma is very muted, as are the initial tastes.



This beer benefits a great deal from warming up to room temperature. The cold serving temperature seems to mute everything about the beer. As it warms, the balance of malt and hops beginings to be more evident and intensifies the experience.



Outside of that it's a simple beer, highly drinkable, a nice example of the stlye and something you are not likely to be disappointed by."

The standard pale yellow, instantly disappearing head reveals the usual corny, grainy aroma and taste. I would find it impossible to distinguish this from hundreds of other adjuncts or macro lagers. Since this is a being brewed by a smaller brewer, it's a shame they have chosen to take the low road and not take the time and trouble to create something worthwhile. Largely a waste of valuable brewing time."

On the up side, unlike many of its counterparts, it manages to pull off a very crisp, clean feel and remains non-offensive. When I break open a bottle of adjunct/macro/cheap North American lager I'm looking for a beer that will quench thirst, give a clean taste and not be skunked. That's about the size of my expectations and Moosehead just about manages that.



Outside of that, almost nothing to report, the beer being non-offensive is about enough for me.



Golden pour, fast forming foaming head which is quick to fade. Some alcohol in the aroma, mixed with a very mild hop/malt balance that is simple and pleasant.



Crisp and clean finish."

This is a difficult beer to get my head around. There are many competing, opposite characteristics that make it really quite complex.



On the downside it felt very light bodied, with a thin mouthfeel. However, the initial disappointment of the lack of body seemed to be immediately compensated for in the lovely light drinkability (for a 7% ABV beer) that came with it.



Then there was the lovely, thick headed pour that initially met me, but after a few minutes the beer had disintegrated into a flat, diet coke type appearance.



This was followed by the next positive experience that was a fruitiness to the definite hop character that I find difficult to pin down, but I like very much. Th hop bitterness was almost simultaneously added to by a layered strong, but subtle alcohol sensation - very nice.



The finish reminded me of a whiskey and water, a sort of dilute spirit taste.



Not as good as the Tripel in my opinion, and anyway it's a different beer, but well worth a try. A complicated beer, that will need an experienced palate to fully appreciate."

Standard Porter appearance, with the highlights for me the very distinct smoky, chocolate taste and the very nice carbonation/mouthfeel.



I find that lots of beers, in several different categories, mention chocolate, but often the taste can be difficult to pick up. Not here. I was pleasantly surprised by the obvious sweetness and smooth mouthfeel. 



A little on the light side for me, with a low ABV and a little thin, but the thin mouthfeel seemed to be compensated for by the close to perfect carbonation.



Try it, you may enjoy it."

The reason I liked this so much was the true to style interpretation. There was a noticeable dryness in the finish of this stout that suggested care and quality. I was happily surprised.



Nice looking, black with red highlights in the pour, with a really, really dark tan head. Very attractive. Some caramel in the nose and then moves quickly on to lots of brown sugar and a hint of smoked chocolate. Sweetness is gone very quickly though, to reveal the dry ending and a lip-smacking finish.

This is a fine example of the style, good smooth body (which is really the most imortant part of the style for me) which made it very drinkable.



Lovely opaque black pour, but smaller than I would have liked head. Initial toasty malts are present that lend the beer a warmth that attracts you into the taste.

To me this is VERY typically French, and much more of Euro style lager than a Belgian.



Label and bottle give a very rustic, farmhouse packaging look. Not sure if this is deliberate or designed (I expect), but it works for me.



Very rich, astringent alcohol taste that is so common in French beers. All the way up from Kronenborg 1664 to the craft beers this is a very common and recognizable trait. This is reflected in the aromas too, with a strong alcohol/spirit presence.



The beer iself remains incredibly drinkable and smooth despite the obvious alcohol domination.



Good, white, rocky head sits atop the crystal clear golden lager pour. A little lacing, but like the head, its all gone far too quickly. Very refreshing, but this has a definite kick, and has the potential to leave a chemical headache the next day. Not a beer to have too many of, it will catch up with you."

A deep, orange colored, cloudy pour (much darker than is usual for the style) with a huge head with fantastic retention, and excellent lacing. This looks like a beautiful beer in the glass and continues to impress on the way down.
Very distinct aroma of apples or cider greets the nose. There is a very grassy, noticeably organic smell that is consistent with an excellent example of the style.
Delicious mouthfeel, full, perfect carbonation and a lovely, unexpected alcohol finish. Left me wanting more, always a good sign."

Pour is classically cloudy gold, with the distinctive, large rocky foamed head. Very little lacing though that somewhat surprised me. 



Fruit aromas start this and overshadow the expected clove and herbal notes. I don't a large amount of the classic banana, but more general fruitiness which is a nice change from the norm. This is a much smoother and sweeter experience than I was expecting. In fact, as the beer goes down the glass it reminds me less of a Hefe and more of a quality lager.



Nice level of carbonation and smoothness lend this beer a good drinkability."
"Hilton Head Brewing Company","Pub Light","","","Light Lager","?","on-tap","1.13","1.5","1.5","1","1","1","12/28/04","Oh dear. My best guess is that the Hilton Head Brewing Company has made a calculated decision that the production of a light lager is what the folks want, and that this has the potential to be a commercial success that exploits the ignorance of the masses.



This is utter garbage. The whole experience, from appearance through to aftertaste, combines all the charms and depth of Bud, Aspen Edge, Michelob Ultra and Spring Water. A real treat!



Pale, with lots of initial carbonation, the brew then rapidly resembles nothing more than frightened water. Zero character. I suppose one could say that this beer is at least fatihful to the style, but it's a disaster zone for BA's.



It's a shame, because they make some decnt beer here, but why one would waste time actualy brewing something like this is beyond me. I know nothing about the brewing process, so perhaps this is an incredibly difficult style to produce and as such requires great skill. If it is a difficult skill to perfect, then it hides that fact well - this beer gives the impression that it could have been whipped up in your garage at home within 24 hours.

Fairly serviceable amber with a mainly malt character and some hop bitterness in the finish. This is a potenatial session beer just from the point of view that it is easy drinking and straightforward.



Not impressed, but at the same time not disappointed. 100% better than, but reminded me a lot of Killians. This beer benefits from a slight temperature raise rather than the ultra-chilled servings that you normally get at the bar.



Carbonation is just about right and a simple, steady mouthfeel. Confident to fall back on this beer when at HHBC."

The color is obviously more attractive than BMC, but the head (virtually non-existent), the serving temperature (too often Arctic temperatures) and the tastes (muted to say the least) all resemble non-descript swill.
Unlike most of those macros, this benefits from warming up. This begins to release a little hop-aroma and a small (if somewhat weak) malt backbone.
Mouthfeel is decent, with some carbonation that renders it pretty smooth and drinkable, but outside of that nothing to report. 
I understand the attraction, loyality and tradition associated with this beer, but quite frankly is just above average. If it's this or macro, take it, under better circumstances probably pass. I was disappointed but not surprised by the mediocrity."

There were some spicy, chicory flavors up front and a body that was preetty drinkable and not substantial. the alcohol comes through in a pleasing way, but strong, but it's there.



No real chewiness associated with this stout, but a nice Sunday lunchtime drink. You could drink this in fairly large quantities because of it's light body, or alternatively just have a couple.



Nothing to write home about, but nevertheless a pleasing find amongst the BMC that's on the rest of the Island."

Poured into a Westmalle chalice to reveal a thick, inky blackness that has yet to be matched by just about anything I can remember pouring - except black ink! Small tan head that left quickly to leave a classic, spotty cream film over the surface of the beer. Looks like a small oil slick in the glass!
An interesting juxtaposition of complex notes and apparent simplicity. Some molasses, but it's on the sweet side rather than the burned side; a touch of caramel as well.
The surprise about the whole brew to me is the lack of bitterness and the upfront sweetness. I was a expecting a much harsher, drier experience. Lots of sugar molasses and a wonderfully controlled ABV. Great brewing!

This is much more like a stout than a porter to me. It's thinner and less creamy than a porter should be in my book, and there is a distinct bitter finish that lets the beer down.



Simple, dark brown/black pour with nothing else to report. Some head, but no lacing. The smell is low key, with very little clout and the tastes are mainly bitter with some hops. Very stout like, weak mouthfeel.



Needs some time I guess, but for now, disappointing.

The pour is a butterscotch orange that is very murky. The bottle conditioning doesn't really help the appearance, and some very clumpy yeast came out of the bottle at the last minute and disappointingly settled in the head. The head itself was fantastic, tall, billowing and rocky. Really pillow like!



The usual characteristics are present in the intial tastes and the aroma - that is, a big grapefruit! However, this beer was different to most of the others of this style I have tried. The grapefruit had been tempered with spoonfuls of sugar. A real strong, sweet malt backbone helps support the hops and the ABV in a way that I have found to be rather uncommon amongst American micro brewed IPA's. A real treat. It's a balanced beer and a subtle Double IPA (if that's really possible).



Some warming alcohol comes through at the end too, all in all a real treat. Lovely, get some soon!

Very nice. Beautiful, deep, dark brown, almost black, with a lovely dark tan head.
Very, very smooth drinking with just the right amount of carbonation. The bartender seemed to think there was a lot of gingerbread in the beer, but I didn't pick that up. I got a smoky, sweet vanilla, with of course, all the mixed spices associated with a quality seasonal brew.
Went down really, well, with a deicious sweet finish, some light coating on the tongue. Reminded me a lot of the local Sweetwater Festive Ale brew in the same mould.
Highly recommend a couple of these if you get the chance."

Unusual this, and fairly average to boot. Pours like an unfiltered, bottle fermented wheat, tasted like a sour lager, calls itself a Pale Ale, what gives??



I usually like the yeast sediment to be added to my glass with the beer, but on this ocassion I wish I hadn't. Rather than getting an attractive, classic cloudy look, I got a nasty, murky pond water effect. Didn't look good at all.



The smell was lemony, almost to the point of seeming artificial and the initial tastes were very sour. This evened out a little half way down the beer, but the damage was done. Some very strong mixed flavors that I didn't care for, including more citrus and then a mild, bitter, hop finish.



A very odd collection of flavors and senses. Probably won't bother again anytime soon."

As expected, very little carbonation on the pour and a quick to form (and to disappear) head. It's very sweet, with lots of honey, but not much of the advertised cherries.
The alcohol content means it's pretty warming on the way down. Full in the mouth without being overpowering, this is a beer that needs to be treated with respect and then you'll enjoy it more.
Very smooth, with only a little bit of that slick oily feeling of such high ABV's at the very end.

It's very ""coffeeish"" with the usual coating in the mouth and sweetness associated with a stout of this quality. I had absolutely NO idea that the ABV was as high as reported here. It disguises that magnificently. There was no hint to me that this was anything other than just a strong beer, I would never have guessed the 11.5%.



Tasty, sweet and a nice stout. Stouts are not my favorite style, but this one came through with all I expected and had heard about. Nice one. Thanks to meathookjones."

Pours a lovely, attractive golden color with a decent head, but one that disappears very quickly. The slickness in the mouthfeel is not unpleasant but really is true to form for beer that has a much higher ABV. This has the mouthfeel of a Barleywine, but lacks the kick. In some respects that's not at all bad, since you get the sweetness and the feel without the ""kick in the ass"" alcohol.



Currants? Au Courant? I have no idea about that or its relevance, but it tastes good to me.



I'd like to try more of this to see how it really sits in a longer session, but for now I enjoyed it, even if it fell between two stools for me.

Solid Porter with alcohol, smoothness and associated drinkability to back up its impressive resume.



I love a good Porter and this is another one. Still can't top my personal St. Peter's favorite, but a great experience nevertheless.



The usual opaque, black pour with some deep crimson highlights (perhaps that was just the lighting rather than the beer, but it looked good nonetheless).



Plenty of creaminess (a trait I look for in a Porter) and smoothness in the brew that makes it highly drinkable.

Before it was usually only hanging around in the Ommegang, triple sampler packs with Three Philosophers and Hennepin.



By no means Ommegang's best offering, in fact I was a little disappointed. That may be because they have set such a high standard with Hennepin, Three Philospohers and Ommegang



The pour is a much more orange/red color than I was expecting with a huge head and lacing too. The overwhelming experience in the taste is one of a slightly sour, spicy yeast taste. Not bad, certainly a authentic Belgian feel, but it lacks the depth, complexity, taste and the general quality of the brewery's other beers.



Apple/acidic nose and flavors are present too.



On the up side, like all Ommegang beers, this is very, very good value. The second time I drank this it was part of the mixed 3-pack with 750's of Hennepin, and three Philosophers AND had an Ommegang glass included for $14.99.

The aroma is all sweetness and sugar and so are the initial tastes. A very, very sweet combination of flavors hit, and the Golden Syrup that is mentioned on the label is very evident all the way through. When I drank this I was craving something sweet and I was not disappointed. This was a massively sugared brew, but not so much as to make it unpleasant nor undrinkable.



The mouthfeel was excellent too, with a distinct lack of that sugar, syrupy feel that can come with the style. 



Alcohol is obviously there, and it threatens, but is nicely subdued to keep you going back for more.

A very attractive pour with an orange, crystal clear body and a decent head. The aroma is all bitter citrus grapefruit and this is replicated in the taste. Unfortunately, the hops with the relatively high ABV is all I get. I don't mind hops, but this is another brew that seems unbalanced to me. The hops give a mildly soapy taste to me.
It leaves a very dry, clawing feel behind in the mouth which is not really very nice at all."

Some spice in the aroma and initial tastes that fades quickly to give way to a class ale. Lots of creaminess and retention in the head with significant lacing in the Westmalle chalice (thanks to meathookjones for the glass AND the beer).



There's a complexity to the flavors here that is not overwhelming, unlike for example, I find Orval to have. I found that I had time to distinguish each different part of the beer before the next became apparent.

I think of this as a classic English bitter. It's a dark beer, with loads and loads of taste and complexity, but above all else it has SUBTLETY! Beers like this aren't brewed much in the USA, where the liking is still for beers of this nature to be either enormously hopped or have massive ABV's.



The aroma starts the experience. It reminds me of Celebrator Dopplebock, with layer after layer of fruity alcohol. The first tastes are all encomposing because they give you everything! You get the warm alcohol, the deep rich malt, a little bitterness, then the refreshing blast - it's all there.



The look is stunning, ruby red highlights agaianst a mahogany backdrop with the perfect head. The head lingers - it looks like you are drinking real beer!

A rather ordinary brown ale with nowhere near enough body for my liking. Quite dry and thin which may be a function of the American version.

This is listed at 13.25% ABV, bigger than previous vintages so I am a bit confused as to why this is not listed as a different beer in the database (surely the recipe must have changed). Anyway, just like all the other vintages this is pure marzipan, with a delicious coke like appearance and sweet, smooth and warming. Fairly obviously, the alcohol is still way too hot and in a couple of years this will be spectacular. For now, lay it down



2003 Vintage, Jax, Sandy Springs, Atlanta, GA, USA.



Wow! I was ready to be disappointed by this because on the whole, I find brews with this much alcohol have a very hard time pulling off the balance flavors. This was excpetional.



Nothing spectacular to look at (the standard flat appearance for a 11-12% ABV brew) so the first thing that hits you is the aroma. To me it's ALL marzipan. Delicious. The whole experience is warming, smooth as silk and everything seems in perfect balance. Unusual for such a high ABV in my experience.



This was exceptional to me because I don't usually enjoy these very high alcohol beers, but this one worked where so many others have failed.

Dark, mahogonany pour with a nice head. There is plenty of lacing and some stickiness too. Quite rich in aroma of sweet chocolate and very smooth on the way down, until the finish which is surprisingly bitter. A nice ending. Some caramel and toffee in there too.



Still a good pint, but not quite what I remember from years gone by and I am not sure that the Old Ale moniker is really that true to what is in the bottle."

This is an especially dry IPA on my palate, with a very clean feel about it. Characteristic citrus hops and nose, with grapefruit being dominant. The finish is also dry and little ""chemically"" which was not to my liking.

Strong malt, yeast, dark fruit flavors upfront in both the aroma and the taste. There is a distinct alcohol feeling to this that is not well disguised and is quite strong. A noticeable spirit like presence.
Very frothy, carbonated head that hangs around, with a strong alcohol flavor all the way through to the end.

(I have a feeling that this used to be categorized on BA as a Vienna Lager but now falls under the American Amber/Red banner. This is certainly in line with what Brooklyn says about the beer, and the dry-hopping does seem to lend a typical American abruptness to the brew).

Updated 08/08

12 oz bottle. Amber hue, minimal head but nice lace. Bumped appearance scores for the beer in general.
Remains quite dry and surprisingly bitter when considering the Vienna lager roots style.
Nose and tastes reflect some deep caramel malts and the dry-hopping seems to add to the edgy character in a surprising way. This beer is less gentle than I remember it before this review but I think that is a good thing.
Definite American twists and influences on a classic European lager.

Original Review 11/04
===
If you are thinking ""regular"" macro colored lager here, think again. It pours with an amber hue and has a much drier and hoppier finish than some of the same style. It also conatains a somewhat of more distinctive bitter finish and aftertaste - not of course that this is a bitter beer by any stretch of the imagination, but in relative terms it seems to drink that way. 
Mouthfeel gives medium carbonation and the beer feels slightly less crisp than many in the lager category but still delivers a satisfying experience."

Firstly I found it very refreshing. A little edge of bitterness and malt, but the right amount of smoothness to take the edge off a thirst.



Secondly it looks great. I think this starts with the bottle! I like the simplicity of the Brooklyn packaging and the predominately yellow label catches the eye. When the beer is poured, the head is solid and not too overwhelming, but hangs around long enough to make it better than average.



With Pilsners and the like I'm always looking for a lack of any skunky aroma as a sign of quality and that's what I get here. An initial bitterness that smooths out over time and a solid malt backbone complete the experience. This is something I could happily drink a very large quantity of, either in one sitting or over several sessions. Good job."

Chock-full of all the classic sweet, dark fruit flavors with the added addition of of some mixed spice and some fruit peel.

The attraction of drinking this is largely lost on me. Under any circumstances, or in the name of any style, ABV of 11.3% coupled with 120 IBU's is getting close to a point that is perilously close to simply going too far. I understand the style, I understand the art of producing massive beers and I understand the role of these types of brew in the grand scheme of beer making and in the grand scheme of an evening's drinking, but even to a fairly well experienced palate this isn't much fun.



This is an unattractive, unbalanced drink that I can't derive any pleasure from. In that light there sees little or no point in drinking it. In my experience, fairly typical of Rogue, in as much as the beer is simply massive for the sake of being massive.

Now sampling a year old (04-05) vintage, the same vintage that I reviewed a year before, below.
Either one of two things has happened. Firstly I suppose it is possible that my tastes have changed, but more likely I think is that this brew has mellowed out over the last year. Much less fizzy carbonation, much creamier, much softer - generally more mellow. Much more chocolate flavor and the alcohol, whilst still very present is a little more smoothed out. Extra points for drinkability, taste and mouthfeel 12 months on.

Fresh (04-05) vintage. Absolutely jet black pour with the distinctive dark tan head and lace that accompanies many of the very best stouts.
This is a pretty substantial beer from all angles. The appearance, aroma of burned (smoky) chocolate malt, the mouth coating that it leaves, the alcohol and the warmth that the alcohol imparts are all on the heavy side. They add up to a pretty impressive beer, but I find that it skates along a very thin razor edge of going too far. It's a borderline beer for me and for that reason its drinkability is not sky high.
Against it was a prickly carbonation that almost made it feel slightly ""fizzy"". A sensation that I didn't care for, and took away some mouthfeel points."

I love this ""Brune"" Belgian style as it reeks of ""real"" beer. Tasty, with a subtlety that belies its relatively high alcohol content, it truly warms the cockles of the heart. I find that the alcohol in this brew takes on a real, depth, like a complex after dinner liqueur it has the ability to satisfy from all angles - aroma, taste, complexity, warmth, drinkability and more.



It pours big, with a rocky, dense head and great lacing.



Lots of caramel sugars up front, but these are tempered by the seriousness of the beer. It is sweet, but not in a ""girly"" way. This is a beer to be enjoyed slowly and in small quantities. Not because it is not drinkable in large volumes, just because it is better if one savors the moment.

There is a very noticable blueberry aroma and taste, but both seem extremely articificial. I would like the appearance of some real deep dark, blueish colors in the beer that the addition of fresh blueberries leads one to expect. When that doesn't materialize one gets somewhat suspicious.



It's drinkable, but it is tart, quite sour in fact and not especially smooth. The fruit lends the beer a dry taste that isn't bad, but I left this one feeling quite dissatisfied. Just got the feeling it could be so much more. Too thin in the mouth, a chance missed."

The aromas have intensified for the better. Much more spicy pumpkin flavors are now present and a extra depth of flavor. This has aged very nicely over the last 12 months.

It's a hoppy and dry bitter, where subtlety is key. You don't get knocked over with a huge whiff of hops in the nose, nor do you get a flavor like you're chewing on actual hops. What you get is a wonderfully crafted beer that is so much more difficult to make than a massive hop explosion.

My problem with this stuff (and others like it) is that apart form the appearance, it has no relation to beer whatsoever. It's tasteless, thin in the mouth and comes with zero character.



The pour does look like a quality pilsner or its equivalent, but the lacklustre frothy head gives it away. The smell is of stale beer, the taste? What taste?

Aroma is mild citrus hops, but the initial taste is way too grapefruit for me. It's really quite a nasty, acidic grapefruit too. It left a very metallic, copper like coating in my mouth. Not very nice at all.
It seems to lose some of the acidic edge after it's been sitting for about 20-30 minutes, but by then the damage is done.

Mouthfeel was better than average but not large, but it did leave a pleasant moreish feel after the first bottle which is always a good sign.
A very creamy finish completes the experience. Very drinkable."

Light colored IPA with a nice looking, frothy head and some lacing.



As expected for the IPA style, the citric hops are up front in both the aroma and the taste, and there is a surprisingly clean bitterness to this beer. Smooth and decent size mouthfeel add to the authenticity of the brew - it tastes and feels like REAL beer! The 7.00% ABV gives it a little kick too, which makes the whole experience even more enjoyable.



The aftertaste is long, clean and bitter and lingers sufficiently to leave you wanting more. In my opinion, truer to the IPA style that I understand than many other similar Americans, this despite its light look.

I'm assuming the yeast and wheat in this beer combine to give the amazing appearance and I was anticipating a wickedly flavorful experience like no other Hefe I had ever tried. In that light the beers appearance overhyped itself, and the mouthfeel, flavor and overall feel was much to thin for me.

Time to re-visit this old friend. Pour is as impressive as ever wih a high, rocky tan colored head and great retention and lace. Brownish, garnet body with perfect carbonation. Smooooth!

The lasting impression of this beer is one of a rich, mature, fufilling experience. Although it would be possible to drink a large quantity of this stuff, it is much better enjoyed as a ""sipper"" in smaller quantities.

A golden yellow, hazy pour with a substantial head that didn't hang around too long. The fruit and spice notes are difficult to pick up in the aroma, but I am notoriusly bad at smelling them anyway.

Thanks to BA, AKSmokedPorter for the info.



As AKSmokedPorter says; ""They've proven they can brew a beer like this, why not do it regularly for the general public????""



With reference to the Tomahawk Amber Ale;



It pours a decent dark brown color with a nice, compact head (nitro-type) that lasted. A nice drink with a sweet malt start and finish with plenty of caramel tastes and a decent hoppy backbone. Good mouthfeel, not a bad beer at all. Put it in the context of a baseball game and you have a (relatively) tasty macro offering. Quite drinkable if you can swallow the utterly ridiculous $7.00 price tag!

I was a little concerned when I read it had been infused with orange flavor, rather than the orange flavor being an integral part of the beer.



Poured a dirty orange color - quite attractive - with a nice head and pleasant orange aroma. Not too overpowering. A very refreshing beer with the orange flavor coming through but not off-putting, but I felt a little short-changed. The beer just wasn't fruity enough to give that experience in full, and had been doctored enough to take it out of the Hefe style.



Mouthfeel was too watery for real satisfaction and the orange end was sour rather than tart.



I don't know, I really feel this is an excellent, potential combination opportunity slightly missed. Still, I enjoyed the six-pack and though it was pretty refreshing, I feel a great chance to make a real stunner passed by."

I probably haven't drunk any Red Stripe for the best part of 10 years, and from what I've read since, and what I remembered from back then, I was expecting very little. In fact, I was expecting to be disappointed. So I was delighted when I experienced a refreshing and clean lager that was very drinkable with none of the nasty aftertastes and junk associated with so many macro adjuncts.
The pour was a golden yellow with a small but decent head that lingered. Some lacing too. A fairly sweet, but nicely balanced experience that was above all else, clean. So often one gets those nasty chemical, acidic aftertastes with over carbonated watery tastes. Not here. Very refreshing, clean, sweet taste. Was it bland? Yes. Was it full of character? No. Did I experience a complex beer? No, but I did enjoy it and would certainly reach for it again as a thirst quencher and everyday, adjunct lager."

Pours with a massive (and I mean massive) head with extreme carbonation flowing up from the bottom of the glass. The carbonation is so extreme that it actually becomes somewhat annoying and almost gets to the point where I am beginning to wonder if the beer is infected!
Once the carbonation had settled down I was treated to the classic deep banana and spice aromas and taste. The dirty brown appearance even looks as though it could have had a banana liquidized into it! There is obviously a significant alcohol presence which is consumate with the style, BUT to be honest it's not as apparent to me as it can be in some other Weizenbocks. Plenty of clove amongst the turbidity and light sweetness.
I get a lot of creaminess with this beer too. A very, very rich experience in the mouth, which for me made me only want one of these in a session. Given the carbonation I was surprised that the beer did not give a more prickly mouthfeel.
Very complex, rich experience all around and a classic beer in the style, but for me, one that has to be enjoyed in small doses."

A fruity, full bodied malty aroma and taste in perfect balance with the bitter finish. Everything is just right! Velvety smooth, large mouthfeel completes the experience. This beer isn't going to please hopheads because it is a subtle, mild mannered bitter, not a ""kick you in the nuts"" type experience - and it's better for that. 



I like to enjoy this as it warms up out of the fridge, say an hour or so after removing it.



Way too little of these more subtle beers are around these days wiith an ever increasing emphasis on huge flavors and hops becoming increasingly the trend.



Adnams does a nice job with the packaging too. This is a beer that is well worth investigating and appreciating. Love it!"

About twenty-five years ago when I was taking my first tentative steps as a teenager into alcohol, one of the the most common drinks that we used to experiement with was a ""Lager and Black"". Very simply this would be a pint of macro lager, often something like a Carling Black Label, Carlsberg, Heineken or the like, with a large dash of Blackcurrant cordial (syrup) thrown in the top. This was simply a variation on the much more common ""Lager & Lime"". This produced a violently sweet, purple colored concoction that was easy for a kid to drink. Twenty-five years later as a BA I pick up a Belgian Lambic Cassis and frankly (with a few minor) details don't see much difference!
Obviously the color and aroma are what first hit you with this beer, with a lovely looking pink head on the top of a purple body. The sweet and sour combination make this brew alarmingly drinkable too.
At first I get nothing but the blackcurrant taste, and even after some time this doesn't receed, but it is slightly highlighted with some more bitter notes from the beer as the bottle is emptied. The blackcurrant is really very overpowering and the only difference between this beer and my original Lager & black is that it is smoother and much more carbonated.
I really enjoyed this, but strictly as a novelty a couple of times a year. In some ways, not really a serious beer at all."

The classic acidity and tartness of the style is evident throughout and until the beer warmed up a little in the glass I found it a bit much. Once an ambient temperature had been reached the whole brew settles down and I enjoyed the second half of the 750 mL much more than the first half.

The aromas here are VERY complex and unusual. I get a lot of fruit, especially pears, but significant alcohol. Unusually the alcohol to me is really quite complicated, reminding me of a liquer rather than a pure ethanol type smell.
Overwhelming experience in terms of taste is the bitter drying characteristic and the way each sip seems different. Quite an experience, not one I greatly enjoyed. Also there is a very significant amount of lambic/barnyard funk that for me at least, is out of place.
A complex beer to me that I suspect is *generally* held in higher regard than it should be. The taste suggests a much higher ABV than 6.2%.

Some similarities between this and the Witte by Ommegang - a bit of a house yeast thing going on for me. One major difference was the more pronounced alcohol start and finish. A little too much carbonation for my taste (the cork popped with alarming vigor) which was also true of the Witte, but still a refreshing beer that I enjoyed.
Probably another good beer to get the macro crowd introduced and involved to better beer. Not spectacular, but different and enjoyable enough to get them interested. Goes down easy and good value."

Very strange this one, I would not have guessed this was supposed to be a Pilsner had I not known. Looks like a standard macro lager, but had a very odd taste. I thought it was spicy, not a mild spice either, quite a pronounced peppery type taste.



Having said that, it was refreshing, cold and enjoyable. I would like to give this another chance. Decent macro type pour with a nice head that hung around a little.

Took me a long time to get around to reviewing this. I've been treating this as a good staple to pick up around Atlanta for some time.



Pours a slightly hazy, orange color with a frothy head. The aroma is one of the few that I feel I can really easily recognize - it's peaches! The hops here are not as pronounced as the style usually demands, but in my book that's a good thing. For others that will be a negative mark.

I had heard an awful lot about this brew, most of it very good so I had high expectations. As is often the case, the hype was somewhat misplaced.
Nice looking pint, with a real golden color, decent head, with good retention and some lacing. This beer was much lighter than I was expecting. I found the aroma, taste and mouthfeel reallly, really light - quite refreshing, but somewhat lacking in complexity and depth. Now, don't get me wrong, it was still a nice beer and I would certainly recommend it, but not to get over excited about it.

Very similar to the Rochefort 6.



A very large head came with this pour, with a significant amount of sediment despite a careful pour. Not sure about that at all.



The overwhelming experience here for me is alcohol and that really wasn't to my liking. Like the ""6"" I found the appearance less than attractive with the dirty brown cloudiness being the overall impression. My wife described the aroma as that of, ""Old Barrels"", that I took to be a compliment!



This beer is warm on the way down, and obviously has a high ABV, but I feel it is lacking in charm, drinkability and subtlety. I don't dislike it, but like the ""6"" I feel it represents very poor value for money. I can understand the appeal, just not my cuppa!"

The mouthfeel is good, with some creamy fullness. I noticed a distinct lack of aroma, an alcohol blast at the finish of the drink and a distinctly dry ending. Not especially enjoyable.

I suspect that this is a brew that can vary depending on the place you drink it. The care that it is kept under and served with is likely to make a difference. I always feel that this style is particularly sensitive to it's treatment when served on-tap.
Poor listless appearance. The Wheats/Hefe/Wits always have the potential to look like cold dishwater, and without a rocky head, good retention and lacing they can be somewhat unattractive. This pour had no reedeeming features and didn't look good at all. Some spiciness in the aroma but very little that I would normally want and expect from the style.
Taste here was very bland with a biting combination of bitterness and carbonation at the end. Thin mouthfeel completed the disappointing experience.

The very fact that AB has the balls to put this on the shelves and at the same time even consider itself a brewer is an insult to me. I assume that AB themselves believe that products such as Bud are decent enough beers, and even if BA's disagree, the people that make those beers would be happy to stand behind their products and defend them.

$2.00, large serving (22oz?), Smokey Bones, Restaurant & Grill, Douglasville, GA, USA.
The problem here I think, is that once one has opened up one's horizons to quality beer, stuff like Miller Lite is hardly what one would consider to be ""beer"" at all.
Is Miller Lite a refreshing, ice-cold, alcoholic beverage? Well, yes I guess potentially it is.
Is Miller Lite a carefully crafted balance of quality ingredients, brought together in a loving and balanced fashion to produce a deeply satisfying experience? Err...well, you can make up your own mind, but then again, nobody is really claiming that it is.
Miller pours the regular pale yellow, piss color, and is often served so cold that any possible taste and aroma are completely undetectable anyway. Often no head, this ""beer"" is best enjoyed in 100 degree heat, when the emphasis required is on ""wet"" rather than any other experience.
Good Luck!"

Certain caramel character in this brew that certainly has the look of a coke when poured. A decent head initially, is almost all gone the second that the beer settles in the glass.

750 mL on sale for $3.99 at Mac's Midtown, Atlanta, GA, USA. Nice job on sale.
The dirty, unattractive Dubbel-like body still bothers me - I'll never get over that.
Still prefer it on draught.

$5.99, 750 mL Arbor Beverage, Douglasville, GA, USA.
Very cloudy pour, despite great care taken, and initially the overwhelming experience is sweet. I get a lot of burned sugar smells in the aroma and in the initial taste. I found that it filled the mouth with an alcohol taste above anything else. Some very thin lacing and a fast receding head.
Mouthfeel is just a little on the thin side for the style, and the alcohol is not well hidden. I like more body and more fruit in my darker Begians and this doesn't provide either very well.
Nevertheless, still a pretty good beer that I would certainly class as drinkable, if generally generally overrated."

Orange, cloudy pour with a frothy head. Honey colored with very lively carbonation, a small head and some lacing.
To me this beer has an extremely light feel to it despite the ABV. For that reason it is a beer that needs respect, simply because before you know it, you could have consumed a lot of pretty potent beer.
I detected a lot of honey sweetness in the aroma and the taste, and coupled with the color and the light feel, this reminded me of a little of a cream ale. To me, this is one of the least Belgian of the ""Belgians"", this despite the fact there is the distinct Belgian yeast character in the background.
Very drinkable, a lovely beer."

I was extremely surprised at how drinkable this was. I always feel that as one gets to 9-10% ABV you are getting into territory that can force you just to have one or two of a particular beer before reaching for something much less demanding. However, it seemed like this could be consumed at an alarming rate of knots! Take Care!



Slightly thin in the mouth.



Cloudy, golden pour, with a small head. Very fruity both in terms of the aroma and the taste. Unmistakably Belgian Tripel with all the sweetness that one would associate with the style, a lovely, drinkable (within reason) example."

This is Sweetwater's flagship offering and it is simply put, steady and reliable.



Very nice offering, a drinkable beer that strikes a very good balance between hop bitterness and malty sweetness. The pour from draught is attractive with an orangey cloudy hue to the beer and a thin head that disappears fairly quickly. I detected very little aroma, but I often think that this is due to tthe excessive chilling that so much beer in the US is exposed to. As it warms things get better.



There is a definite sweet start to the drink that fades to a bitterish finish. The bitterness is mild and enjoyable.

$2.99 Greens Beverage, Atlanta, GA, USA
July 1st 2004, First day of higher ABV beers being legally sold in GA!
I often fail to pick up and identify fruity aromas in general, but with this beer it's all ripe bananas and pears with a faint alcohol tinge. Yeasty bread too. The breadiness of the beer continues well into the taste and it dominates rather than the Belgian yeast strain and candy elements that sometimes ride high in beers of this style.
It pours a dark brown, slightly murky color with a good head made up of small bubbles and quite light. Good lacing.
The taste? Well to me it's a little on the sweet side. I like malty sweetness, and I like strong brews, but this one doesn't quite strike the perfect balance for me. Don't get me wrong, it's a classic, well established and superb Quad but when you get up to 10% ABV, you have to be pretty careful with the balance and the taste, or things can go awry fairly quickly. The alcohol content coupled with the sweetness are *almost* a little too much in combination; certainly this is not a brew you could drink much of in any one sitting.
Mouthfeel is a little lacking depth for me. Not exactly thin, but not really as substantial as you would expect for this type of brew.
A classic example of the style with much to endear it but despite that, for me it's an occasional rather than a regular in the rotation."

A cloudy brown pour that really isn't all that attractive, but there is a beautiful rock foam atop that makes a great decoration. The whole brew is chock full of taste, with the sweetness and bitterness in just the correct proportion. The ABV is strong enough to give the beer its edge, but not too much as to overpower it.

Aroma is all orange with a large frothy head that disappears quickly but offers good lacing. It goes down very quickly which was probably a combination of the hot weather and it's very light body. 



Normally a beer this light in body would seem very watery, but the fruit somehow makes that lightness OK. Very, very refreshing, a delightful change and alternative to a fizzy light beer for quenching thirst.

Mmm, mildly disappointed, but tempered by my love for Porters in general.

This would not be my first choice, and I believe there are plenty of other cheaper, better beers of similar style out there (St. Peter's Old Style Porter for example).



Gave a huge head with a non-aggressive pour, with lots of nice lacing - something we see too little of in general.

This is much better enjoyed at room temperatures, or at least removed from the fridge for some time before consumption.

In this particular case (the ""draught"" nitro bottle) we are treated to something that looks like ""draught"" Guinness but that's about where the similarities end. This stuff has a watered down smoothness and is consequently less heavy the ""draught"". It means that the taste, mouthfeel and general experience are not comparable to real draught, but it does make this stuff incredibly drinkable in significant quantities!

Always a decent body and color with a good head, nice bitterness and a well rounded ending.

Fuller's ESB provides the quintessential biscuit malt base with fruit overtones and a gentle kiss of hoppy character that caps the whole thing. The beer produces a great head that lasts and gives some fantastic retention. Definite extra points for aroma - plenty of bread in there against the malt/fruit backdrop.

Schlitz. Not being an American, or growing up with this beer I can't really comment on its legendary status, but I hear it is a classic. My wife tells me her father used to drink this when she was growing up and it seems to have a nostalgic affect on most Americans that I talk to about it.



Simply put, you get what you pay for - but frankly, I like it. This is a no-nonsense American lager that doesn't pretend to be what it's not. It's certainly not tasty, nor is it satisfying, but it is a cheap, cold, refreshing drink. Consumed chilled to the max on hot days, it's a decent brew (also see Miller High Life).



It pours with a much less incipid color than I was expecting, nor did it have an offensive aroma. A frothy, very carbonated head that fades quickly was apparent. There was no unpleasant aftertaste, nor the nasty, harsh, alcohol based flavor that can come with this genre. Actually, this beers non-offensive qualities and blandness are in its favor.

Very strange review this one. Essentially Miller High Life, is, at least on the face of it, everything I dislike in a beer. Light colored, no body and a distinct lack of taste (either hops or malt), a mass produced American macro with little or no appeal to those who enjoy quality beer...but...I keep on coming back to drink it. 



One thing it does have is absolutely first-class drinkability in hot weather. Living in Atlanta this gives it a head start. In addition it's cheap. Now, price isn't something I'm desperately concerned with, and I'll gladly pay enormous sums for good beer, but my philosophy is this; If the beer I'm drinking is a poor quality American, mass produced macro, then I might as well drink the cheapest since I'll be wasting the smallest amount of cash!

My father would never let me drink anything else but that stunningly magnificent brew.



Many years later we come up to date, I am confronted by a label that says Bass, and I see the famous (oldest in the world I believe) red triangle trademark, but what's in the bottle bears no resemblance to those halcyon days.



Ho, hum. This is a mahogany brown pour with some head depending on the aggression, with a hoppy start but mild finish and aftertaste. The creaminess is always surprising to me. This is a beer which is routinely murdered in the USA simply by the temperature that it is served at. Bass brewers would be appalled. In my opinion this needs to be a room temperature serving, nowhere near a refrigerator, let alone coming out of huge containers of ice.

The exceptions to rule two of my earliest experiences with nitro-cans which were Boddingtons (which usually imparts more flavor than most) and (in my opinion) the Granddaddy of them all the original draught Guinness Bitter (in the green can).

I really believe that, on draught at least (I'm not fond of this in the bottle), if looked after properly, this can be an decent brew. Its appearance is usually very nice, and for a lager, it consistently produces a large, full, creamy head.

Nice example of a typical English bitter product. Sam Smith's is one of my least favorite English brewers but they have produced a really nice beer in the Winter Welcome Ale. This beer has a certain cleanliness and clarity about it. A beautiful amber pour with a really refreshing taste dominated by a hoppy start, fading to a more mild malty overtone, going back to a bitter finish. I thought this was quite complex in taste and enjoyed the different experiences I got as I got down through the bottle.
Nice lingering head with lacing too.
The English bitter flavor was complimented in an unusual way by the lightness of his beer. Normally I prefer the heavier, darker bitters and the Belgians, but this proved to be refreshing and light without losing the taste and becoming watery. Well done."

Nice hoppy aroma and initial flavor that mellows out as the bottle is emptied. It poured with a very tight creamy head that left some lacing. I was impressed with the color, a deep reddish brown. In fact the color and dryness of the beer reminded me much more of a red than I was expecting. The hops are initially quite strong in the mouth, but quickly fade to a more pleasing milder taste.
A fairly strong, bitter aftertaste that was a little over-powering for my taste, but still gives this brew a feel of a ""proper"" beer. Another example of the brewing art from this consistent brewery."

This brew is an excellent example of a light, dry stout. The lack of heaviness led to me giving it a 5 on the drinkability score. I really liked this mainly becuse it gave a nice light ""hoppiness"" and a light bitterness on the aftertaste that can sometimes be overwhelming in other stouts.

355 mL bottle as single as a gift from Penney - many thanks. Sherry aromas are still present for me (after all these years).
Simple beer, remains smooth and tasty. I like a little more cream in my Porters but still a classic standard, especially when you consider what I can reasonably get in the USA.
Original Review 01/04
===
A sherry/sweet coffee aroma came before a fast fading ""reddish"" head. The head left the beer quickly with very little lacing and no creamy layers.
A bitter finish was preceded by a very attractive dark, creamy experience.
Not my very favorite Porter but a fine example. Drink some soon!"

Love the St. Peter's bottles and the look of this fine brew. An amber pour with a really frothy head leaving some excellent lacing. A really refreshing, light ""ale"" taste, but still flavorful.



Slightly fragrant aroma which is something I don't normally enjoy, but the light refreshing nature of this brew was really different. Almost like a ""light"" beer for serious drinkers. I was pleasantly surprised. Very drinkable since it goes down so well."

The picture (label) on the large brown (1 Pint 6 fl oz) bottle looks like a drunk, Communist Jesus - highly amusing!
Poured a red/copper color with a decent head with some (but not much) lacing. A little chill haze.
Malts upfront with a very light bitterness and not nearly as dry as I was expecting. Highly drinkable and somewhat refreshing. Definitely a watery mouthfeel, and lack of body.
Finishes with a little hop dryness, but remarkably balanced for a Rogue beer, since in general I find their beers to be over-hopped in many cases."

I love this bottle, it looks like there is medicine inside, and frankly I felt better after I had consumed the contents!
It poured a beautiful chocolate brown with a dense, creamy head that fades to a very attractive spotty, creamy thin layer for the remainder of the glass. This beer is complex and smooth with an exceptional mouthfeel. I think it gives the perfect combination of stout creaminess and ale taste. The heaviness of stout is missing, but it still provides the smoothness associated with some of the best stouts.
I see from a number of other reviews the many BA's don't consider this brew heavy enough to be called a ""proper"" Porter. That may well be the case, but nevertheless this is a magnificent drink. I guess I'm not really a ""proper"" Porter fan, more of a fan of ""pseudo"" Porters, but this brew struck the exact right balance of ale and stout for me. Delicious!"
"Wychwood Brewery Company Ltd","Hobgoblin","","","English Brown Ale","5.20%","bottle","4","4","4","4","4","4","1/25/04","Nice. Poured a caramel red color with a large foamy head that subsided quickly. Lots of lacing. This is what I would call a full flavored English Ale and nice to see it in the clear bottle. I always associate these bottles with real ale that I've usually drunk on draught before trying it in the bottle (e.g. Old Speckled hen). The bottle gives it an authentic ""Ale"" feel. I think this would satisfy somebody looking for a tasty beer but who was still looking for something that wasn't too heavy. A refreshing experience with a very hoppy finish. Would certainly pick this up again."

There was a distinct fruitness in the aroma that was not evident in the taste. Like almost all of this style of beer very thirst-quenching. I can't help but associate the Hefe's with summer drinking so I always encourage the consumption of these in the warmer months - I don't know why, but they always seem to go down easier then."

I'm not a huge fan of stout in general, and as a result my scores may be a little on the low side.



Regardless of that this is one hell of an impressive looking beer. As black as any I can remember, with a truly brown head. The mild bitterness that this gives, truly coats the roof of the mouth for an unmistakable stout experience. The after-taste was much more mellow. The whole experience was one I enjoyed, but if stout is not your bag it should remain an occasional, rather than a regular tipple.



Drinkability is high because there is a lack of bitterness and although this isn't one, it drinks like a milk or sweet stout.



Reminded me of my dad drinking bottled Mackeson back in the 1970's - a taste a child never forgets!"

A cloudy orange/copper appearance with a good head that faded quickly. Just the right amount of carbonation for me (very little). Very clean bitterness with almost no chemical aftertaste like so many American beers. All in all very enjoyable - a nice drink. Would reccomend it to bitter drinkers and real beer lovers as a decent, substitute for the real stuff. The fact that it looks like real beer as opposed to urine helps, and has flavor and isn't fizzier than ginger ale is also on its side. Good work Dogwood."

Poured with a large frothy head that disappeared instantly to reveal a lemon colored solution. The overwhelming experience of taste, aroma and aftertaste is alcohol. I found it very difficult to distinguish anything else. I don't feel that this particular mass-produced North American lager is any worse than any other, they all are instantly forgetable. Of course we all have our own favorites and styles, but I simply can't imagine getting any joy from this weak offering.



No taste, no feel, no joy - not really beer in my opinion."

I enjoyed this beer, but I suspect that may have been simply because after over exposure to Miller Lite, Bud, Rolling Rock etc. one tends to relish even the most ordinary of tastier microbrew styles.



Good light brown head and a decent enough head (that nevertheless faded very quickly) was followed by a slightly dry and slightly thin experience. Balanced and simple caramel malts and light fruity/floral hops but not much to distinguish it from many others. Dryish finish. A simple beer that is refreshing if somewhat non-descript.



Not my favorite of all time, but one I would certainly go for again ahead of all mass produced lagers."

A nice amber color with a head (that really reveals what appears to be an awful lot of carbonation) that disappears very quickly. The first few mouthfuls were very ordinary but by the time I got to the third (cooler) bottle it seemed to get better. A mild taste with a distinct lack of bitterness or hops is not really to my liking, but nevertheless a very drinkable beer. Wouldn't be in a rush to go for this again, but wouldn't specifically avoid it either."

Surprisingly, a highly carbonated pour with really quite a fizzy initial appearance. Murky brown color in the body. Dubbel appearance.



Belgian yeasts are apparent in the nose with some fruits but they are difficult to distinguish specifically.



Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side for the style and there are many better in the mouth than this one.



Great trailblazer for Belgian beers outside of the continent, and its contribution will never be forgotten (at least by me), but this beer seems a little dated. Don't get me wrong, this is still a classic but with an ever increasing array of wonderful Belgians and Belgian styles in the marketplace, Chimay seems to have lost its edge a little."

I've had it since it first came to Georgia, so a decent amount of time on it now. Opening corked & caged affair gives a pretty alarming pop with some good gun smoke. A really dark chestnut colored pour that reminds me of the most mature conkers that I had as a kid. A thin, creamy film/cap forms on the beer as things settle down and some mocha like lace attaches self to the inside of the Brasserie de l'Abbaye des Rocs goblet. A somewhat bready, chocolately nose that has a grain character as well. The grain/cereal notes are carried forward to the taste. the beer drinks with a dry bitterness that one would expect from the style, and finishes a little burned. The grainy notes are surprisingly evident and there's a strange build up of warming alcohol at the end of the beer. The beers a little thin and lacks presence for me. Not an entirely aggressive beer by the standards often set by the style, but nevertheless it still offers the rough edges and lack of refinement that is commonplace in this style."

Pop on opening is modest, with a little gun smoke. Pour is a beautiful golden clarity, with a smallish head. Lace is present but not tremendous. Considering the ABV all is in order, and the color is truly pretty to behold. Carbonation seems somewhat restrained but again, quite appropriate. The nose is an absolute treat. A huge estery, lightly phenolic pineapple barrage that does not let up. The tastes follow that lead with plenty of sugar coated, pineapple-cube candy and have decent levels of all of the elements one needs in a beer like this - white pepper, Belgian yeast notes, a little more candied sugar, some alcohol and a touch of earthiness in the back end. The alcohol is certainly present and dallied a little with a solvent edge but always manages to step back at the last second. Peppery bitterness cuts in in the finish and back-end of the beer to add to my satisfaction. As it warms the beer seems creamier, and the sweetness builds to give even more Tripel like character. The kind of beer that Ommegang makes incredibly well, and the inspiration that they take from Belgium is easy to see."

Mid-amber pour with a nice clarity. Head is reserved, but appropriate.

The nose is really rather strong with plenty of sherry liquor notes which get me rather excited.The aroma promises a richness.

The taste don't really match the virility of the aroma. There is certainly a huge malty, sweet, bread-like presence, and a dash of the sherry note among the alcohol, but not in a manner that the aroma initially suggested.

A nice rounded mouthfeel, tasty malts and a dash of sherry. No peat or smokiness to speak of here, but nonetheless a tasty offering."

Medium (appropriate) carbonation. The nose is where the special nature of this beer start to manifest themselves. Rich caramel, biscuit malts combine to reveal a classic, English malt and mid-hop character brew. Slight dry finish that one would expect completes the package with a touch of soapy bitterness in the aftertaste. Don't think of this as a Winter Warmer and you'll be happier. This feels much more like a classic English ESB than just about anything else, and it delivers thecomplex malts of a gret British pint with ease. Really tasty, a beer that showcases the malt spectrum beautifully well."

Tobacco feautes with some leathery components, but the beer lacks a sweet edge that really needs to accompany the smoked malts. Slightly too bitter for me and this beer frankly lacks the charm and subtelty of many other smoked beers. Frankly i was disappointed. Not up to speed for me."

Best before 30/03/09 (March 30th 2009 for you Americans) so I sneaked in! I've been tracking this for literally several years so delighted to try this one today.
Poured into the Tucher Weizen 500mL glass this looks superb. The color is as rich as any Doppelbock I have ever seen and the clarity, carbonation and head are very good. Lace and retention are not the VERY best, but the color is ESPECIALLY good.
Nose is a GERMAN malt bomb. I use the adjective ""German"" to describe that particular strain of breadiness that one expects from such a beer. Again it's great.
The funny thing about this beer is that for such a highly rated brew, the taste is arguably the weakest point! After an amazing ""look"" and a great nose, the taste almost (but not quite) seems a bit of let down! It's solid, but definitely not the best Dopplebock I've ever had. The alcohol is in check and the beer seems (if anything) a touch light.
Very nice and VERY German, but it bats slightly below the BA review average. ""Disappointment"" would be harsh, but nevertheless, not quite what I expected."

$1.50 as a single from Green's on Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA. A new entrant to the ATL market just in time for the serious Spring/Summer outdoor season in the South.
Pour has perfect, golden clarity with very little lace and not much head after the initial wave. Carbonation seems low for a Pils of any description.
The beer has a touch of aspirin bitterness but lacks that Saaz bite in the finish that I'm looking for in a Pils. Slight skunk. Not *that* clean, either.
It lacks a little in terms of being a high quality Pils but it has the potential to make up for this by being in the can (welcome), good value (also wlecome) and an OB product. I get the feeling that this beer may get some plaudits it does not quite deserve - we'll see.
For me, OK, but not up to the usual standard for OB and not a really good version of the style either. Make up your own mind."
"Pisgah Brewing Co.","Solstice","","","Tripel","9.0%","bottle","4.15","4","4","4","4.5","4.5","3/7/09","$11.75 for the corked and caged affair via mail from Bruisin' Ales, Asheville, NC, USA. Bottle says 9.5% ABV and has the text, ""January 2009 +"".
Possibly the most tightly wound cage that I have ever come across, a bit of a pain to get off. Follow this by perhaps the most tightly inserted cork ever, and you get the picture. BIG effort yields a very small pop and a tiny whiff of gunmoke.
Pour is a light orange/golden color with some good head and lace. The head lacks density somewhat but it is substantial and it does have decent lace.
Sweet alcohol and pepper hit the nose.
The tastes are quite frankly not as profound as the nose would suggest. There is a really nice combo of all of the pre-requisites of a typical tripel like Belgian yeasts and candy, alcohol, white pepper and coriander, but it is really well balanced, in check, simple and understated. Drinks well below the advertised 9.00%. Pretty smooth and the beer avoids some of the typical prickly carbonation and mouthfeel that can be associated with some tripels.
Very nice quality but this is NOT an ""in your face"" version of the style. In that respect it represents nice introduction to the style and would be easy drinking for those trying to get into this style.
Tasty, simple and easy drinking, a very nice beer."
"The Lost Abbey","Cuvee De Tomme","","","American Wild Ale","11.0%","bottle","3.3","3.5","3.5","3.5","3.5","2.5","3/7/09","So I had an ""opportunity"" to purchase one of these at $53 for the 375 mL! I decided to pass on that which turned out to be a GREAT decision since;
(a) the ""groovy one"" hooked me up in a trade for an equivalent of a fraction of that cost, and
(b) $53 for this would have been absolute robbery!
Anyway, back ot the beer. 2008 vintage.
Distinct lack of pop on opening and only a faint whiff of gunsmoke. The nose is increasingly acidic as you take more and more whiffs.
Pour is a ruddy brown with a small collar of bubbles. No lace. Light carbonation - a little ""fizz"".
Tastes are tannins and dry notes. Very vinous and red wine like. Light vinegar is there throughout the beer but does not really manifest itself properly until the finish. Quite a lot of woody notes as well.
I get ZERO cherry notes, I assume that the fruit is only there to provide some natural acidity and some dry tannins from the skins. Definitely a Flanders Red/Oud Bruin beer as opposed to anything that resembles a Belgian Strong Dark to me.
As it warms it mellows a little, but not much. Alcohol extremely well hidden.
I dunno, quite what all the fuss is about is lost on me. As far as the way this beer drinks and tastes, it is definitely incorrectly categorized in the BA database. Poor value for money, this is a one and done for me."

Pour reveals a pretty decent, orgnge clarity and some head with a little retention. No lace to speak of.
The nose seems EXCEPTIONALLY malty for a even a pale ale, and the sweetness is the abiding memory of the smell.
Tastes have an upfront soapy nature (good), but fade rather badly. Sweetness cuts across the back end of the beer in a syrupy manner to leave me (and the palate) feeling a touch abused! Finish is not balanced and quickly reverts back to an unbalanced collection of tastes.
Not the worst effort from AB, but still leaves so much to be desired. I might be better if these beers were left to those that give a shit."
"Hog's Back Brewery","T.E.A. (Traditional English Ale)","","","English Pale Ale","4.2%","bottle","3.48","4","3.5","3.5","4","3","3/3/09","From notes:
Had this on both cask and in the bottle. This review reflects the bottled version.
Another classic pour which yields a small, ivory colored head without much carbonation, and a woody looking brownish body. Not much n the way of life to the pint, but it does look ""genuine"".
Nose and taste reveal standard biscuit malts, although these seems a little muted and sweeter than some. There is a paradoxical finish that is rather dry and woody which almost has me wondering if the T.E.A. moniker is playing tricks on my mind (as if i were expecting a tannin based finish). Odd mind games!
Anyway, the beer flows easily across the palate delivering a slightly acidic note in the end. Not sure if that is intentional or not, but it makes for an unusual combination.
One of the more distinct and recognizable beers in the style, but at the same time not really my favorite. I'd always recommend trying it regardless, but it's a bit of an outlier in terms of the taste."

If I were to sum this beer up in a simple way, I would say it was authentic or ""in style"".
Orange pour with great clarity. Bone white, frothy head with some good lace.
Nose is of the earthy malts that so often define the style. Finishes with te same earthy tastes, a feature of the style. Nice, smooth mouthfeel.
Without ACTUALLY knowing the ABV, this beer gives the impression of being a sessionable brew with simple drinkability and good balance. Nothing spectacular, but certainly solid.
I'd like to try this on draft, closer to the source, or even in a non-standard, cask version - it would be interesting. Slight grassy notes, tasty and simple."

Nice red color that produces a decent head but the lacing and retention are a little weaker than one would expect from the style and the initial pour.
Aroma is strong and yileds a fresher hop note than I was expecting - really quite floral and fresh. ""Green"" comes to mind. The initial waft soon subsides to yield a slightly more ""normal"" effect.
Tastes are pretty authentic for the style with a big blast of bitterness which recedes with the balancing malt. To me the finish of an Irish Red is by far the most important part of the beer. For an authentic version of the style I'm looking for a dry ending above all else and that's what we get here - a good sign.
There's a very organic feel to this beer with some apparently genuine, herbal, grassy and rustc malts and hosp used. I like it very much. Delighted to get a big brewery brewing a sensible beer that falls well within style.
Good stuff."

Pale orange pour with frothy, bubbly head.
Nose is a very mild hoppy note with a sweetish grassy note in the background. Essentially this gets carried through to the tastes. This is a VERY mild easy drinking, simple well balanced beer. The hoppy bitterness is one that is basically tiny, but it builds as the drink is consumed. It's obviously cumulative.
Very close to a sessionable, highly drinkable version of an English IPA. Much more balanced than many American beers (of ANY style), and in that respect this pleased me with its simplicity and easy drinkability. Tasty."
"Russian River Brewing Company","Beatification","","","American Wild Ale","5.5%","bottle","4.23","4","4","4.5","4","4","2/28/09","Batch 002, thanks go out to the ""groovy one"" for the chance to try this.
Corked and caged, 375 mL, olive green bottle.
Poured into the Urthel Bock goblet, the color is as advertised with a light, golden body and a degree of haziness. The head is not really present to any degree as it dissipates to large, well formed bubbles on the collar.
The nose delivers that expected very light, acidic funk, but to be honest it is more subtle than I expected. Green apples.
More green apples greet the palate but this is overtaken almost immediately by a colossal sourness. Interesting because it is difficult to imagine a beer more sour than this, but at the same time it is not THAT astringent. Yes there is the POWER of vinegar, but not the taste. Wave after wave of grassy notes combine to give a delightful hay and manure experience.
Once again I must say that this beer is simply NOT a new thing. Anyone who has experienced DRY, Scrumpy, farmhouse cider served at the source in Devon and Somerset KNOWS this taste and this experience pretty much to a fault. It IS true that these beers deliver a degree of sourness that one normally doesn't find in the farmhouse ciders, and that the fruity apple note is missing, but essentially they are born of the same beast.
375 mL seems about the right serving size, much more and it would be a struggle. I might even split this one between two. It's a superb example of the style, but not for the inexperienced. Helps if you grew up on the Devon/Somerset border like I did!"

AT LAST, a new SN beer that is NOT the umpteenth hop based, IPA clone for the bazillionth time - in itself that's a minor miracle for SN! Congratulations!
Anyway, back to the beer. Fairly standard pour in terms of color, with a smallish coffee colored head. The lace is very good as the beer is consumed.
The nose is quite alcohol based but this does not manifest itself in the taste. The alcohol IS there, but not as astringent as the nose would suggest. The malts certainly deliver the usual tones and notes for the style, but it seems sweeter than many in the style to me.
Drinks beautifully with sufficient alcohol to deliver warmth, but not as much as to induce heartburn. VERY mild smoke (barely noticeable to me), and plenty of rich body complete the picture. Very tasty indeed, and I enjoyed this much more than I was expecting I would.
Definitely worth a shot if you get a chance."
"Asheville Brewing Company","Ninja Porter","","","American Porter","5.3%","bottle","4.33","4","4","4.5","4","4.5","2/23/09","Split the 22oz bomber with some of the usual suspects down at The Brick Store on a Friday afternoon. Long live these gatherings.
Very standard pour with the black/brown body yielding some reddish highlights when held up to the light. Head is generally a short-lived affair with a rather sparse amount of lace. Looks still, low levels of carbonation as there should be.
Nose has a touch of roasted malts and very little hop presence.
The nose is continued into the taste and in that respect I was a touch surprised (pleased, but surprised). This Porter definitely lends itself back toward the classic English drink that I am familiar with. More on the creamy side of things than the hoppy side of things, with an emphasis on the subtle rather than the aggressive. As a result, unlikely to impress the palates of many on this side of the Atlantic and more likely to be a pleasing beer for me. More of an English style Porter than the generally over-hopped American version.
Finishes with some very gentle smoke to complete the picture.
Tasty, and pleasingly understated. Many Americans will find this dull, I found it charming."
"French Broad Brewing Co.","13 Rebels ESB","","","Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB)","5.2%","bottle","2.78","4","3","2.5","3.5","2.5","2/23/09","Picked this one up at Riverside Beverage in Chattanooga, TN, USA. I believe that it may have been a s little as $3.99 for the 22 oz bomber. Shared with some of the usual crowd at The Brick Store on a Friday afternoon.
Pour yields a very clear, golden body with an impressive, rocky white head and some nice lace. Head retention is good, too. If I'm honest I would say that the appearance of the beer is probably its strongest suit.
The nose and tastes are fine, put simply WAY too hop based for my liking in terms of an ESB. Don't get me wrong, this is NOT a ""hoppy"" beer as such, but it is far too fragrant, hop based and floral for the style. The malts are basically absent as far as I can tell, and the beer is just too clean and cutting on the palate.
ESB? My foot."
"Baird Brewing Company / Fishmarket Taproom","Temple Garden Yuzu Ale","","","Fruit / Vegetable Beer","6.5%","bottle","3.98","4.5","3.5","4","3.5","4.5","2/22/09","Having been mightily impressed with my first Baird Brewing beer that I tried last week (Natsumarkin), I was delighted to find this 22 oz bottle at Green's on Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA. $7.99 for the bomber.
Pour is a magnificent, hazy, dark orange pour with a great looking fluffy head and some lace. It sits in the Tucher Weizen glass resplendent! Carbonation is excellent and consistent.
Nose seems a little hoppier than one would expect and also has a soapy element. (This is NOT repeated in the taste).
Tastes are mellow. Definite fruit sweetness with a slight slick note to the mouthfeel. It seems as if the alcohol is higher than 5.5%, but it remains drinkable and non-invasive. The fruit is very difficult to place, but it seems like a passion fruit or perhaps a guava. Tropical in its nature.
The overall feel here is something that is bigger than 5.5%. This is a consistent and persistent feel. It seems slicker and heavier than the ABV would suggest.
This is a very different beer to the Natsumikan. That beer was much more ""refreshing"" and light, and although this beer seems in the same ballpark in terms of ABV it drinks very differently. However, STILL very drinkable and delcious, maybe my favorite new brewery for SESSION beers! Very excited by these new found gems."

The look is NOT the strongest part of this beer. Poured into the l'Abbaye Brasserie des Rocs chalice, the fizziess is short lived and leaves absolutely no lace or head. The color is a murky, dirty, brownish magenta. Not that attracive at ALL, but it does seem to get more pink as it warms and less volume is present in the glass.
The nose offers some light raspberry but the oak seems to dominate.
The tastes are where this beer shines for me. A lovely combo of sweet and sour with the dominant flavor being the bitter, dry notes of raspberry seeds. Fruit is strong, but magnificently balanced with acidity. Again the raspberry seeds come through strong with some nice sourness.
This is a VERY approachable fruit lambic that gets away from sweetness and gives the drinker a real sense of what a genuine fruit lambic should do.
Lovely, a great beer to put into my regular rotation."

I may be mistaken, but I thought this beer used to be classified on BA as a tripel AND I have never paid any attention to the ABV - now I'm regretting that I didn't get a chance to share this one rather than drink it all myself! Oh well....
The pour surprised me at first because it comes down as an orange, slightly viscous body with Barleywine appearance and a lack of head and lace to match. This instantly confused me as I was expecting a Tripel with pepper notes, a lighter body and better lace. A quick check of the ABV on BA confirmed just about all I need to know - this is NOT a traditional Belgian Tripel, and after about two small mouthfuls I knew this was basically an English Barleywine in terms of the way it drinks.
The beer is basically a HUGE, MASSIVELY sweet malt and alcohol bomb and essentially nothing else. I like it, but there is just NO way that I need 22 oz of this. This beer would be better if it were delivered in 8 oz bottles IMO. The warmth in the alcohol is attractive and the sweetness comes through as a honey note. Belgian candy is enormous but yeast notes are less obvious. Pretty slick in the mouth as you would expect.
Drinkability is AMAZINGLY good considering the style and the ABV, but it's not really very drinkable - DOES THAT MAKE SENSE??
I dunno, it's all a bit much for me. This kind of stuff gets a little tiring. This is basically an English bareywine, HUGE in terms of taste and alcohol."

Pour leads to very good clarity in the body, a mid-amber hue and some nice head. Good retention, but strangely not much lace.
Aroma gives a malty promise which is fairly well, faithfully reproduced in the taste but also is accompanied by quite a harsh, hop based finish. Drying in the finish too. This leads to a clean experience but a little too soapy for the style IMO. Some nutty character redeems this.
I guess it's true to the American Brown Ale style to an extent, but in my mind Brown Ales need to be maltier and sweeter regardless of their origin. This is neither so I don't feel it does the job too well. Nevertheless, drinkable.
Used a couple of bottles for some bratwurst marinade and they worked very nicely. A touch above average I guess."

$8.99 for the 750 mL capped and foiled champagne style, dimple bottomed green glass, heavy vessel. Total Wine, Perimeter, Atlanta GA, USA.
EXACTLY as anticipated the rich brown color is punctuated with a very dense and large number of floaties. Generally coagulated proteins are a big problem for BdR, and this beer is no exception. Quite ugly, and refuses to settle for a LONG time.
Head is good initially but fades to not much very quickly.
Nose reveals nice Belgian sweetness and yeast. Fairly solid.
Body and tastes are a little lighter than I was expecting. The beer reflects some alcohol richness, but it seems a little thin for the style. Not ""bad"", but lighter than I wanted. Big, rich alcohol malt notes. Simple and delivers no surprises.
Not my favorite beer from a brewery that I generally have huge affection and respect for. Frankly a little disappointing, but this still makes it above average."

He saved this for some of the stragglers that couldn't make it on the previous day for the cask tapping.
Jet black, still pour with no sign of life in terms of carbonation or head or lace. Perfectly still. The beer is actually nowhere near as viscous as the pour might suggest. I'd even go as far as to say it is relatively ""light"" compared to what it could have been.
The nose reveals the spirits, but it's not especially potent, rather it is a smooth, almost brandy like smell rather than a massive sinus clearing alcohol note.
The beer drinks very smoothly and lacks the alcohol heartburn that I was half-expecting. It's pretty much as you would expect from the original Old Ale with sweet smoothness and a simple classy, malt based experience.
Very tasty, excpetionally smooth and a great choice to sip and savor at the end of the evening. Much more drinkable than I was expecting too."

Light vegetal nose but barely recognizable as beer.
Body is as expected but if you can taste much of ANYTHING you are a better man than me. Seltzer water would be my description.
Funny stuff; imagine giving a 64 drinker a RIS for comparison of styles!!!
I suppose it has a role like water - drink with ""death wings"" and all will be well. Lacks skunk so no foul in that depratment.

Dark amber body with disappointing lace and head. Colour is strong, but the rest of the appearance lacks much presence.
Nose seems to be the strongest suit for the beer and has a touch of boubon or liquor. I have ABSOLUTELY no idea where that is coming from but the source seems to be an exaggerated malt profile. Although the liquor is an odd thing to be picking up, I am glad to have a large malt note in a style that SHOULD be exhibiting such traits.
Unfortunately the tastes drop off a little too quickly for my liking. It has some sweetness and nutty character but the beer leaves me disatisfied in general and lacks much presence in terms of the mouthfeel. A touch weak.
Perhaps a chance missed, but ultimately not much more than slightly above average."

Huge thanks to Grant for the opportunity to crack this one as a shared growler with many of the usual suspects at The Brick Store, Decatur, GA, USA.
Pour is a typical mid-orange beer with a nice head and lace and some good clarity in the body. NOT perfectly clear, but still lacks much haze to speak of. Soapy lace created - a good sign.
The nose is a combo of grassy sweetness and sinus clearing, west coast hops.
The tastes ARE extraordinary. There is a distinct note of late hopping aroma, and it has tremendous balance. Simple and large hops, but nowhere near as aggressive as one would supect from such an obvious west coast hop bomb. Tasty beyond my wildest expectations.
I am ASTONISHED that this is tagged at 11.00% ABV - this beer drinks at about half of that, and the alcohol is simply NOWHERE to be seen (or tasted). There is tremendous balance here, BUT the hops seems to cumlative. By that I mean that the more of the beer you drink the more th hops sseem to build and fatigue the palate. I started the glass thinking that it would be no problem to drink the whole growler, but as I got to the bottom of a large glass I was beginning to change my mind.
In no way is this a typical American, west cost DIPA. It's infinitely more sophisticated and subtle than the usual nonsense associated with many of those beers, and in that respect I was amazed.
My pessimism had me thinking that this might be a let down, but this is one of the few beers that reached the expectations that had been flagged for me. One of the very few beers that just about managed to live up to the ridiculous hype. WOW!"

Very light orange pour with almost complete clarity. To be honest it looks a but thin and lightweight. Some lace but no head that offers any sustainability.
Nose has that really typical, earthy and organic malt note that comes with the style.
Malt dryness is repeated in the taste and there is quite a bite in the finish. Pretty well balanced by the flavor is what I would call ""strong"". The aftertaste lingers somewhat too. Dry malts backed up by some hop bitterness. Tasty.

The latest (I guess) AB incarnation/stealth venture into the ""craft"" market. Strange stuff for AB, all marketing rather than a true invested INTEREST in artisanal products.
Pours a dirty orange, murky and fairly unattractive color. Head and lace are both disappointing; this looks pretty drab and uninspirational. Looks a little tired already.
Completely FLAT - both literally in terms of lack of carbonation and metaphorically in terms of a lack of taste and presence. By that, I mean there is simply nothing to it. Mild sweetness the beer but it is watery and listless to put it mildly. The style is one that often suffers from a lack of depth and this beer takes it to that ultimate level.
VERY poor effort and close to being one of the poorer AB efforts. Shabby beer."

Honey, hazy, ruddy pour with a VERY large amount of debris in the glass. Not dense enough to fall to the bottom, it swirls around in the body of the beer. A touch of lace but virtually no head retention.
Definite sweetness in the nose and this carries into the taste. A sharp, almost sweet and sour note to the beer. Clean and tangy. Cuts across the palate swiftly with a real, sweetened citrusy character. The honey seems to manifest itself as a high alcohol taste, almost like a Euro, slick high ABV lager.
Well, it's certainly different and I don't dislike it but to be honest the two or three that one finds in the mixed winter pack is going to be enough for me."

Served in a goblet/chalice, the beer pour a typical bright golden hue with a significant amount of clouding. Head was a little disappointing and offered very little in the way of retention or lace.
Alcohol is certainly a large factor as it the sweetness. Mild white pepper overtones (good), but a little on the slick side (bad). All in all a solid rendition with the emphasis on sweetness and alcohol as it should be. I'd have liked a little more definiton, but to be honest it held its own pretty well. Honey notes as it warms.
It seems as though this has become the signature beer for Brugge Brasserie and I can see why. Solid, if not spectacular stuff."

Tangerine pour with a high head and nice lace in the Duvel tulip. Head fades quite quickly to yield a spotty lace and collar.
Nose offers a soft citrus note, but not very strong. A touch of potential hop bitterness too.
Tastes are a very simple, light citrus that delivers a very refreshing experience. The aftertaste gives a more pronounced grapefruit like twang. Floral notes too.
Very simple, very easy and very drinkable. Delighted by the ABV as well. Great spring sipper and this will go down well on a warm, early summer Atlanta afternoon as well.
GREAT beer for the newbies as a crossover option, and it should provoke some conversation with the Japanese angle. Delighted to have it here, and I'll be buying this again."

Nice, dark cherry red body (a touch on the brown side), with a lovely, subtle pinkish tinge to the head.
Dark, black cherries meet the nose. A touch of ethanoic acid in the nose.
The beer is a simple, relatively non-complex lambic that has only a light level of tartness. An excellent beer to introduce lambics to a newbie without exposing them to a crazy tart Cantillon or a crazy sweet Lindemans version. Very nice fruit notes of black cherry skins come through strongly in the finish. This is very tasty.
A touch prickly in terms of carbonation in the mouth but still very nice and it complements the package well. The finish combines the gentle tartness and fruit sweetness beautifully. Throw in the great ABV and I'm VERY happy. Delicious."

It's 01/31/09 and the day of the Atlanta Cask Ale tasting. I decide to pop into Green's on Ponce to do some ""pre-cask purchasing"" and I see this, 22oz bomber perched on a pile of cases, all alone. I knew that this was not in GA at the time, so I was naturally interested and picked it up. Taking it to the register they had terrible trouble locating it in the sysytem; basically it wasn't there. This precipitated 'phonecalls to Adam who was not at the store. Eventually they sold it to me for $4.99. I told them (in jest) to tell Adam he was running a crappy store.
Anyway, later in the afternoon I'm at the Cask tasting talking with Adam and he says he has a mystery to solve about someone buying his ""sample"" bottle of Lakefront Bridge Burner! Well, it amused me.
Back to the beer.
Mahogany red pour with a lace and head appropriate for the style and ABV. Looks pretty rich. The head gives that yellow tinge that I associate with a beer like Arrogant Bastard.
Nose and tastes are very solid and reminiscent of the Arrogant Bastard classic example of the style. This holds up to scrutiny well, with some serious grapefruit and alcohol combining up front, and the bitterness and alcohol coming together in the middle and the finish. 
Drinks pretty well considering the stlye and the ABV. Some residual sugar.
Poor man's Arrogant Bastard - as simple as that."

It drank pretty well at that point to me. Anyway, she described it as a ""Belgian Wheat"" that was brewed as batch 777 by the brewery. Apparently they mark these numbers with special beers.
Nice Tripel color and it sit well in the glass with good head and lace.
The beer is overwhelmed by the sweetness, and any subtle notes of spice or specific adjuncts is blown away by the sweetness. I really like sweet beers, but this was at the extremities of even my tolerance. they really was nothing else except the sugar.
As a result of the sweetness the drinkability suffers badly and also I didn't mind drinking the one I had, there was no way I was going back for more.
Ultimately a failed attempt at a Tripel."

Mild citrus all the way around in terms of the nose and taste and not much else.

Described on the beer menu as a Dubbel this looks, tastes and drinks much more like a Quad, and even has a few RIS notes. I spoke to Crawford and he agreed about the Quad descriptor, but was less sure of my RIS comparison. He LOVES to brew these ""style-defying"" Belgian beers and this is another example of the fine art he is in the process of perfecting.
Pretty much jet black on the pour as far as I could tell with some billowing, tan head. Te head is the color of a typical RIS, but MUCH lighter in appearance and consistency. 
Wave after wave of rich toffee and molasses notes compete with the Belgian candy for your attention. This is certainly a mighty sweet beer, but a delicious, rich and full one. I described it as simply being SUMPTUIOUS. A few touches of licorice in the back it finishes with a flourish and with more, after dinner sweetness.
Very tasty, but at around 12% (I don't think that 15% in the BA db is accurate) this is strictly a one and done on any visit for me. Nevertheless a ""must have"" next time you're at 5SN.
Although there is clearly NO bitterness to speak of, I'd put his down as a Quad or even (despite Crawford's protestations!) a Belgian Stout. Either way, it's SUPERB."

Nose has a light hop note but not much else.
The tastes are pretty much solidly in line with the style. Drying malts with a touch of bitterness in the finish. A good, rich and creamy mouthfeel to the beer too and the sweet, dry and bitter characteristics of the style are well married together. Classic, malty bock aftertaste completes the picture. Good stuff.
Satisfying.
I don't know that you would necessarily call this a quinesential bock, but it's certainly a very solid example of the style and something I would be happy to present to a newbie as a strong bock/lager candidate."

12 oz single as seen in the BA database.

Nose lacks any kind of presence. Corny sugar?
A lot of grainy sweetness in the taste and not much else. 119 calories is heavily advertised on the label so I guess that they are looking to compete with the Lites/Lights of this world. By definition that puts this beer at the edge of my tolerance, and although it says that this is brewed ""in the tradition of a Grman Kolsch"", I don't see it coming up to par in many areas.
Pretty run of the mill for a beer that an aspiring craft brewer is clearly attempting to pitch to the BMC crowd. Frankly they would be better off making a much higher quality brew and staying away from the potential crossover market.
Not much to report here other than a better option than BMC."

Love a good Wit, but the style walks a fine line for me. There are some things that must be avoided, and other points that it must hit. I like a really spicy note, and I love a heavy yeast presence, but perhaps most importantly it must avoid a watery mouthfeel. The mouthfeel is perhaps the most crucial thing since it can make or break the deal for me.
The beer pours a typical, lemon based cloudy color but lacks a large sediment presence. Lace is good, better than normal for the style. I'd like it a bit darker, but the good head and lace make it a 4.0 for me on appearance.
Nose: some white pepper and lemon in the nose. Aroma is strong - I like it.
Spice, coriander, yeast and pepper notes ARE there, but to be honest it falls slightly short for me. Just not quite there.

Where this beer goes in the finish is the interesting thing. I'm not sure if this is by design (either for this beer in particular or for the style), but it dried quite violently in the finish. Very, very dry as it ends and in the aftertaste, and I was surprised how quickly the mild fruitiness that started in the brew turned into this finish. A bit odd.

Nose and tastes simply reflect the style very well. There are plenty of slightly resinous notes and a complimentary, slightly slick mouthfeel to go with it that is appropriate.
Malts are in check, which again is appropriate but to me the combo seems somewhat tired. I'm not sure if the style is getting to my palate, but the beer gave me a bit of a yawn factor. Why not brew something DIFFERENT to make a mark? An entirely predictable (and in that light) disappointing choice. Slick bitterness fatigues the palate really quickly.
Grapefruit and pine are there, but a touch unbalanced for me.
The beer isn't bad, but it seems so uninspired to me. Loads of these American IPA's are all over the market so drink away!"

I want to say $10.99 for the bomber but not positive on that.
I was a little bit wary because I thought that FFF might go a bit overboard on a style that, IMO, needs to be handled carfeully. Let's find out.
Quite a dark orange pour in the Duvel tulip, this beer forms a large head wirh some lace but not great retention. Spotty, white film forms on the surface of the brew as it settles down. Cloudy appearance gives away the bottle-conditioning.
Nose reveals a bit of buttery diacetyl, not at all what I was expecting and more than a little worrisome. Grassy sweetness in the aroma too.
The grassy sweetness gets carrried into the tastes which are a fair bit floral in their nature. Definite lack of serious funk and really rather sweet up front. The finish produces a touch of hop bitterness and a small amount of tartness but they are both fleeting. Floral nature is what I am going to take away with me from this experience. That and the Belgian candy notes. As it warms some VERY distinct honey notes.
Slightly slick in the mouth which is not surprising given the ABV.
Easy drinking and the alcohol seems well hidden, but at the same time I was expecting a little more, and certainly a beer that wasn't quite so sweet or so floral.
Not bad; not great."

MANY thanks - MUCH appreciated by me.
Totally coincidently, review #1800. Original batch, one of only 48 released bottles.
Sampled on three small pours.
Golden yellow color with pretty much complete clarity. No carbonation, head, lace or retention to speak of.
Fruit notes are basically non-existent. If you are expecting a kiwi note of any description you are going to be terribly disappointed. Mid-range sourness and funk, nothing heavy-handed at all. Some green apple notes, this is very close to a dry, west country cider (England). Sharp and clean, but not very astringent at all.
Mellows out on warming and with that comes a little more round, fruit character but nothing that you would describe as kiwi based. In terms of the fruit, non-descript.
Tasty and delighted to have tried it, but not my favorite of the Upland lambic tasting group. Another example of rarity causing a little too much ado about nothing."

Nice color on the pour with a deep russet, red/brown. Color is good but the head is non-existent. No head, no retention and no lace. Very poorly carbonated.

Nose and tastes are SPOT ON for the style. Very rich and malty with a nice depth to the body (don't forget this is NOT a Doppelbock). Very tasty indeed. Lovely, sweet depth to the beer and some serious drinkability. If they could fix the carbonation issue this would be even better.

Pour is a slightly darker than macro lager pour, and one that produces a slightly better than average head. Still no lace.
Mouthfeel is REALLY thin and rlacks any Marzen richness - disappointing. Nose is frankly non-descript and the tastes are muted.
There is a touch of Marzen sweet character, but it seems VERY ""macro"" based. Finishes surprisingly dry which would seem to contradict the malt based beer that I should be drinking. Odd.

A light touch of antisceptic funk in the nose. 
Taste has a little funk and some sweet and sour notes. Not really any honey that I notice. Perhaps a bit in the finish but it's very muted.
The introduction of the honey seems to make an otherwise potentially funky beer somewhat bland. ""Bland"" is not a very good descriptor of the beer (it's an unfair criticsm), BUT it certainly lacks real presence compared to other Saisons.

A bit of a disappointing pour. I say that for a couple of reasons. Firstly the color is a wee bit dull. Opaque orange amber body and very little head and lace. Secondly although the head is in line with the ABV, the whole thing thing seems to lack much life or edge. A little dull.
Nose and tastes are VERY vanilla based to me. Light bourbon and sweetness finish it.

The taste is surprisingly hoppy. I was expecting a beer that was a touch more malty, but this came through quite resinous and piney. As it warms it gets a little more sweetness, but to be honest it still seems quite bitter.

There is a smudged, inky, dot matrixed Best Before date on the label but it is unreadable.
This appears to be a pretty rare find, but perhaps Thomas Creek is re-releasing/re-making it.
I am VERY wary of this for two main reasons. Firstly Thomas Creek has been pretty much an unmitigated disaster in my book - beer, after beer, after beer has been disappointing in many cases, and very often just horrible - and secondly at 11.00% it's just about three times the ABV that I really hanker for. That said, I'll try anything at least once.
OK, the pour is a nice, orange/golden affair with some very surprising carbonation. Streams of fine bubbles create an equally urprisingly good head. Obviously virtually no lace, but that would be asking a lot given the alcohol.
Nose reveals a somewhat artifically sweet alcoholic smell which is not the best feature of this beer.
The tastes are very sweet, and I hesitate to use the word ""balanced"", but at the same time are not too overpowering. I like sweet beers so this may be something that I can stomach that others wouldn't. Light fruits, slick mouthfeel and more than a hint of alcohol, this drinks like a large Pilsner as the label suggests. Reminds me of an English barleywine.
Surpisingly drinkable (considering the style and the ABV), and surprisingly good given my experience with Thomas Creek. Having said all of that, this is still strictly a VERY infrequent beer for me and I doubt that I'll be seeking this again for several reasons, but...better than anticipated."

Pour is indeed very dark, even red for an IPA. Good clarity but it seems a touch over-carbonated leading to a little prickly nature in the body. Head is ivory and small, but there is a small amount of sticky lace that adheres to the glass.
NOT typical of the style in my book. To me this drinks MUCH more like a red ale, with that distinct dry character and malt bitterness that one might associate with the style. (Malt bitterness may seem like an odd term, but it makes sense to me!)
Surprisingly grassy, medicinal and sweet in the nose.
Finish is typically dry for an amber (if this were one), and aftertaste is sweet (more paradoxical stuff).
This beer has a distinct bitterness, but the lingering memory is of some serious sweet malts. I really don't quite know what to make of it, but having said that it is pretty tasty and drinkable. If the BA db is accurate then the alcohol is very well hidden.

A little floral hop note in the nose. 
This beer seems to drink a little muddled to me. The hop profile is there but to me it seems a bit jumbled. Citrus notes yes, but at the same time I get competing soapy hop notes and some slick malts. The combination is a little powdery and lacks definition for me.

Well, the marriage of these three breweries certainly makes for an intriguing combination, but at the same time it makes me a little nervous. Jolly Pumpkin has been very hit and miss for me (I just don't want funk in EVERYTHING), Mikkeller aren't exactly know for their subtlety and Stone have pushed a few boundaries of their own.
Dark garnet pour with a tan head and sticky lace. It looks rich - and that's good because it IS! (In fact if there is one word to describe this I would use ""rich"").
Nose reveals basically a Standard Belgian Dark. The standard dark fruits, plums and raisins. Very rich and full of promise.
Tastes also reflect many of the usual Dark Belgian notes but the detail (and the Devil) is in the finish. The ending is where the rye, marmalade, all spice, orange peel and bitter figs drop in to say Hi! They linger too, to leave an aftertaste that is distinctly Winter Warmer like. a touch of alcohol in the end too.
VERY interesting beer (which in no way should be surprising at ALL), and it almost splits into two separate experiences. Essentially a classic, Stone, Dark Belgian early on, and then followed by the influence of the other two breweries with the spice, bitterness and weird ingredient combo. Funny, since you could almost predict the whole thing from the label. VERY tasty, very interesting and very moreish. Great stuff."

Nose and tastes are pretty much as you would imagine. There are very few surprises here. Dark, bitter chocolate, decent warming alcohol and some hardcore hop and malt combos. Alcohol comes through more and more as it warms. Very roasty and a large amount of charcoal. Charcoal is really the biggest influence here.
Not a real easy beer to drink, and that's even taking into to account the alcohol and the style. the burned notes are not easy to deal with.

A little more attractive than your average Dubbel. More clarity and a slightly more reddish tinge rather than the dirty brown dishwater note that often accompanies the style. Head and lace are there, but fairly minimal.
Serious fruity and bubblegum nose with some definite yeasty notes. Belgian character in the nose but it seems a touch artificial or ""plastic"" to me.

Batch #2, October 2008.
Nice, reserved gunsmoke on opening. Poured into the Ommegang chalice, this beer sits in the glass as a clouded, honey orange brew with significant lace and a nice spotty film on the surface of the beer. Nose has a very mild Brett presence and a little English lemonade. A touch shandy-like in the aroma.
Really, nice finely carbonated, creamy mouthfeel.
Taste follows up the nose with very, very light citrus backing up the light Brett. No real depth of funk here - it's all very reserved. Some fairly significant, chunky yeast in the last pour.
The more that this warms, the sweeter it gets and at the end the funk is so mild that the beer has almost turned into a sweet and sour combo. 
Very enjoyable and drinkable, but if you are looking for serious funk, try a Jolly Pumpkin instead. More solid stuff out of Cooperstown."

Jet black pour that is reminiscent of a stout, but lacks the creamy consistency and mouthfeel that you would normally associate with that style. Thin collar of lace forms.
Strong apple cider acidity in the nose that has me a little worried. It almost smells infected!
Tastes are better than the nose would suggest. Sweet, mildly alcohol licorice. A little thin and the cider infection taste comes through a touch too. I'm pretty sure that the beer is NOT infected but it appears to be a ""natural"" trait of this brew.
Easy drinking and the sweetness certainly reduces the alcohol profile.
Odd beer in some ways since it lacks much of any hop profile, especially considering the American Strong Ale category. I'm also a little suspicious of beer marketing companies with 100% contract brewed products."

Very little ""pop"" on opening, but it pours with a little more carbonation than the initial opening would suggest. Essentially this looks like a flat Coca-Cola. The coloring is that quintessential caramel color with a few reddish highlights.
The aroma is a bit ""sap-like"" - organic, like a tree or leaves! Drinks a little musty, and tastes a little like a really low quality diet soda. Finish has a bit of sweet and sour, but it is a strange combination of old, dusty tastes.
Obviously the style has very few reference points so it's extremely hard to say if this is much of an example, but it is fair to say that this is not very tasty, not much like many other beer styles, not very drinkable and not to my liking! Difficult to get more than half of it down.
I suppose I might try again with another Kvass, but this isn't exactly inspirational. On the plus side I like the ABV!"

Dark brown pour with some fairly significant electric orange highlights at the bottom of the glass. A very rich and fullbodied brew from the look, through the mouthfeel and on to the taste.
Roasted chocolate notes are prominent in the nose and these get carried through to the initial tastes. Really rich and creamy until the very end when the rye kicks in. The chocolate is very front loaded and forward.
I must admit that I'm not a huge fan of of the rye bitterness in general, but this only cuts in at the end.
In a blind taste test I think I would place this in the chocolate porter or chocolate brown ale region - it's got more chocolate character than some ""chocolate"" beers, especially the recently released and reviewed Terrapin Side Project #4. Nice stuff, thanks again to Jaime."

Light, buttered and toasty malts along with some whiffs of sherry get in the nose.
Lovely, full flavored beer that reminds me of some of the best English bitters. There is a touch of winter spice that does lend itself to the WW category, but to be honest it seems to blend perfectly with the toasty malts so it becomes one with the remainder of the beer. Very well integrated. Sherry notes again come through.
Extremely tasty with a nice full mouthfeel and a really satisfying, light hop ending. Very moreish and with about 1.5% less alcohol this would be a ""go to"" beer for me.

A number of the geeks at the pub didn't care for this; I say that their palates are jaded with huge beer, after huge beer, after huge beer. It's fairly typical of the American problem of lack of appreciation of subtle, lower ABV beers that don't smack you upside the head. The appreciation of subtlety is not a strong suit of your average American beer seek!

Body is a little darker than your standard Hefe. A golden with a LOT more clarity than I was expecting. Carbonation also seems a little higher than expected. Head is small, and falls away pretty quickly but not without leaving some nice lace.
Nose and tastes are certainly authentically Hefe-like with banana notes, a touch of bubblegum and a little alcohol, but serious clove notes are missing and the beer is a touch too understated for the style IMO. Odd, since give an American brewer a classic style and it seldom ends up as a more subtle version! Light alcoholic soaked fruit in the nose.
A touch buttery with some diacetyl notes, but this is surprisingly not really much of problem. Drinks smoothly and easily.
All in all not really a classic Hefe by an stretch of the imagination, but still a drinkable effort and something I could see doing a nice job in the southern, summer months."

One of my favorite styles from a proven brewer, this should be a nice beer.
Lovely, slightly clouded amber body with some better than expected carbonation. The head is well formed and leaves some really impressive, sticky, dense lace. The color of the head is that slightly rust tinged color which is common to American Barleywines. The appearance reminds me of an Arrogant Bastard or perhaps a Lagunitas Brown Shugga.
Nose is as expected if somewhat reserved. Light bubblegum, a touch a banana and a little sugary alcohol.
A touch viscous in the mouth, the beer answers all the calls as it should. Very nice balance (not too sweet) and nicely combined sugars, alcohol, banana notes and a warming finish. If this really is nearly 9.0 % then it is impressively hidden, even though there is a presence.
Very nice example of the style and an extremely solid beer. Really enjoyable with high drinkability."

http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/3/1565/?ba=Ding
In the BA database this has been categorized as Doppelbock (No), Barleywine (No) and now back to Dopplebock (??).
Having done that, now consider this newly bottled version, $4.99 for the bomber from Tower on Piedmont, Atlanta, GA, USA.
If it supposed to be a Dopplebock then the appearance is a zero; otherwise it looks good, I don't really know how to score this.
Pour here again is a crystal clear, golden affair with a nice head and lace. Carbonation is strong with plenty of bubles. Alcohol is still quite prominent.
ZERO hint of Dopplebock color, and frankly this still drinks like a craft beer version of a Malt Liquor! I have NO idea what malts they are using in order to generate this color, or what they are calling a Dopplebock but whatever it is it's REALLY ODD! What is a ""Helles Dopplebock"" (as it declares on the bottle) anyway??
I dunno, this is all very confusing. This does not drink or look like any Dopplebock that I have seen in nearly 30 years of drinking but at the same time it's not a bad brew as long as you like high alcohol, slightly slick lagers. Imperial Malt Liquor anyone?? Imperial Pils at BEST!

Apparently black, or at least very dark brown, pour with some nice rust colored highlights at the bottom of the glass. Some lucious, thick, tight-bubbled head, and lace which lends a smokey, yellowish tinge to the color of the suds.
Nose reveals very little which is a touch surprising considering the ""chocolate hype"" surrounding the release of this beer.
Also surprisingly there is very little chocolate taste in the beer considering its pitch. Smooth, easy drinking and virtually no hint of alcohol either; it was nice to enjoy a porter which to me seems a little more English than American. Lacks the silly over-hopping and bitterness that many American versions of the style stray into, and instead it delivers more of a classic, creamy, subtle experience. Either the alcohol in this is relatively low, or it's immensely well hidden.
My palate only gives the standard chocolate notes that one might expect from the normal malts used in the style, and the extra effort in terms of the chocolate seems to fail to manifest itself.
If you are looking for an obviously BIG tasting beer with layers of chocolate and a huge ABV, pressed into a package where you get the hoppy bitterness of a typical American porter then this will disappoint. To me, it's probably the best of the Side Project series so far and a porter truer to the original than I was expecting."

VERY strange. I did not do any research on this before I opened it so I didn't not know what Lagunitas had put together for the latest Zappa release.
The pour was essentially dark brown with some murkiness and not much head or lace. I get some thin film of froth on the surface.
This beer is incredibly sweet (even for me and my sweet tooth). EXTREMELY malty. It was difficult to get a handle on the style (without checking it out first) and I thought this might be an Imperial Brown Ale or even a Dubbel/Belgian Ale (due to all of the candied sugar notes). To find out it was a RIS was very surprising. Frankly as a RIS it's poor; if you ignore that and take it for what it is (a malty bomb) then you'll be OK.
Not much else here, it's all sweet malts and no bitterness. I get Belgian candy notes and a touch of chocolate porter-like malts. A very light touch of licorice in the back end is the only hint of bitterness and stout character that I get. Cocoa and baking chocolate finish. A touch powdery.

Aroma and taste come together to give a very distinct porter, black patent malt presence. I don't know what malts are used here, but that's what it tastes like! Body is definitely not a viscous as many of the style and for me this adds to the drinkability.
Sweet roasted malts and lack of hop bitterness - in that respect I like this. I fact, I might even have thought that this was an imperial porter rather than a RIS. Anyway, it matters little as it is very drinkable (sweeter rather than hoppy; thinner rather than thicker) and tastes complete.
Well rounded and ""sensible"" RIS rather than immensely rich and too big.

Updated Review 09/12/10 - 2010 vintage
===
Having been totally convinced in the past that the smell and the look of this beer were always better than the taste, in 2010 with the higher ABV, I feel a few things are quite different than they have been in the past.
Firstly the beer still has a lovely color, but the head, retention and lace are not quite as good as they once were.
Secondly the smell is not quite as aggressive (or pleasant) as in years past. Plenty of brown sugar and some pumpkin spice, but it is VERY reminiscent of a pumpkin candle above everything else - you may find it in your bathroom! As far as the smell goes, this is a step in the wrong direction and it is nowhere near as potent as it has been in years past.
Having said that, what we lose in the aroma we gain elsewhere. The beer drinks very nicely with some creamy notes, sweetness upfront and nice, soapy bitterness in the back end. The lingering end is also a feature that I enjoy. MUCH more drinkable than in years past for me.
A tremendously interesting beer, but not one I can get a handle on very easily. This is definitely a beer that I strongly suggest that you try and work out for yourself. Opinions are likely to be all over the place on this one.

Original Scores; 3.5, 5.0, 3.5, 3.0, 3.0, 1.5
22 oz bottle, thanks go out to cashew70 for the chance to try this one. Cracked amongst friends at The Brick Store on a Friday afternoon.
Pour is a mid-orange, clear bodied beer with a nice, simple, white head. Lacing is minimal.
Nose? MADNESS! A combination of cumin, cashew nuts, salted peanuts, cinnamon and spice. It is absolutely exceptional (hence the ""5"" score) but it is not really to my liking; exceptional most certainly not ""good"".
The taste is an odd combination of experiences that eventually evens out to some kind of pumpkin pie taste, but it takes some time to get there. This should not be too old, but it is a few weeks into its life.
A very, very odd beer. As one of the guys said, ""this is the kind of beer that after a heavy night of drinking is the one that send you over the edge and makes you vomit"". Not sure what that really means, but at the same time it made sense - CRAZY beer!
I did NOT like this as much as the score suggests, but the smell IS a ""5""."

Pour is a hazed, light copper/orange body with plenty of white, sticky lace.
Nose is HUGE and is ALL tangerines, clementines, oranges, lemons and other citrus fruits. More ""orangey"" than any other beer that I can recall. Interesting because it is not really a ""hoppy"" fruit note at all; it's ACTUALLY just really fruity!
Tastes follow the nose. Very fruity and not really any note of big hops or alcohol. A strange beast indeed because it's really a big IPA that doesn't drink like one. Easy drinking and very thirst quenching.
Obviously from the notes above it's easy to tell that all I really got from this beer was the fruit. It lacked much bitterness on the palate at all, and the alcohol is well hidden. Super drinkable as a result and a very fragrant (without being floral) DIPA. Almost to the point of being orange infused! Tasty."

Having had at least one beer from BrewDog that I thought was very poor, I was very reluctant to start shelling out this kind of money on a beer that being aged in liquor casks, is simply not my favorite thing. Of course, curiosity eventually got the better of me and I went for the beer in the series that I thought I would enjoy the most; the sherry based one. Here goes.
Pour is mahogony brown. Thin ring of foam forms a collar. Nice legs. 
Some sherry-like notes, but the nose is extremely muted - I was disappointed. The thin nature of the beer is carried through in the taste and the mouthfeel. VERY weak for a RIS, and although the beer is not bad, to me this is basically an old ale. Bittersweet licorice notes, but if you are looking for a viscous, high alcohol, dense RIS then this is NOT it. Also some diacetyl in there too - this seems to be a feature for the BrewDog range.
I dunno, this is a dreadful disappointment but at the same time is not a horrible beer. Having said that it's a poor example of the style. HORRIBLE (I mean HORRIBLE) value to boot."

High, off-white head with a sticky lace residue. Quite sweet upfront by this levels out to give a well balanced brew. To my palate this is very obviously dry-hopped. If it ISN'T then it sure as hell tastes like it. Hazed appearance.
Mild soapy notes, some grapefruit and a refreshing grassy malt backbone come together to produce a memorable beer. I found it very thirst quenching and moreish. Having said that ABV is a BIG turn-off for me - if only we could get someone to make such a tasty beer with half of the alcohol! What about a HopArt DIVIDED by 2??

Massive gusher with froth everywhere and a large amount of the beer wasted. It would have been good to read some other reviews before opening this one but either way there are carbonation problems with this brew.
It's black with a real, toffee colored head. Very roasty, quite hoppy and in that respect it's a typical American version of the Porter style. I'm not really keen on this type of Porter (I prefer a smooth, creamy version), but for what it is, it's pretty good. However the carbonation is a problem and not only from the gushing point of view. Unsurprisingly it imparts a really difficult prickly nature to the mouthfeel which makes it a difficult beer to really enjoy.
All in all the base and basis of this beer is good, but the carbonation is a nightmare which ultimately de-rails the brew. Shame."

Very smooth but not in a thick way. Quite light in the mouth but has good presence. Simply balanced porter with good sweetness but very well balanced. The beer has a toasty nature to it and a residual sweetness but it is not at all slick or clingy. The sweetness is not recognizable to me as a coconut element, but there is something a little different there. Definite a nd pronounced chocolate malt; milk rather than dark.

$29.95 from Green's, Buford Highway, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Look, I've been to the Brussels brewery twice, travelled extensively in Northern France and Belgium so I know what I'm talking about, but I have to say the beauty and subtlety of Cantillon and the harsh Lambics still at least partially evades me. That's after years and years of sampling them far and wide. I dunno, I guess it's just not a taste that I am gonna ""get"". It's strange becasue I generally really enjoy off the wall, strong flavors and odd foods but time and again these beers fail to satisfy me. At $30 a bottle, this is getting to be an expensive way to find out!
Fizzy initially on the pour, the beer soon settles to give a still, light burgandy body with a touch of froth around the collar. The nose is wine-like; a light Australian red comes to mind.
The acidity is significantly less than some of the other (even harsher) Cantillon products, nor is this as dry. I was surprised by that since I though the oak might play a bigger part in drying the palate out. Light fruit flavors are there, but the tanin and the skins seems to dominante for me. Mild funk too, but as usual it's the sour nature that overwhelms so much of Cantillon. This was much more drinkable than many other Cantillon products so maybe I am coming around a bit, but if so this is a LONG journey!
I dunno, after nearly 30 years of drinking high quality beer and tasting many of these Lambics and sours along the way, I'm about to call it a day. Maybe I'll be back in the future but value for money is also going to play a part in what I will invest in in the future."

Pours with deep brownish/black with some nice ruby red highlights. Head is mocha and very well formed. Fairly short-lived, but there is a little lace and some spotty residue and collar left on the surface.
The nose has quite reserved for a barrel aged beer. I like that fact. I think that the Whiskey as opposed to the Bourbon barrels help in that regard.
Overall the beer is very light, smooth, well put together, balanced and easy drinking. My bet is that the few months of age on this are helping the beer a great deal since I often find this type of brew a bit much. Light roasted malts, rye in the very back end and a smooth, simple warm alcohol note all the way through. Not especially rich but that adds to the drinkability."

Nose is probably the best attribute with plenty of mild acidity along with apples and some grassy hay notes.
After that, frankly this is not good. It's VERY weak and watery and lacks any depth. Some green apples but the whole thing suffers badly because of the lack of presence. It's almost to the point of watered down apple juice.

Alcohol is there and it kicks in at the finish. Decent alcohol delivery vehicle for the winos and kids, but for me it's a pretty nasty combo. Some metallic bitterness in the finish and a solvent/aftershave note at the back.

Nose reveals some hard fruits - apples, pears but is pretty light. A touch of sweet and sour tartness and perhaps a hint (no more) of funk.
Light orange with a peel like, marmalade twang. Mouthfeel is very light. A touch more bitterness associated with unsweetened grapefruit, but again quite mild. Finish is a touch metallic and lingers. Tartness and acidity finally ends the experience.
Extremely easy drinking, this is a bit like a Saison without the depth of body or the pronounced funk. Equally suited to cold or hot weather drinking, I could see myslef sinking a few of this outdoors and relishing the cans.

750 mL corked & caged with 2008 and St. Somewhere printed on the cork. Nice pop on opening. The beer pours much too dark (for a Belgian Pale) for my liking. The color is a dirty, clouded brown and defies the notion that is is a ""pale"". Head is high and tight. I dislike the color, a lot!
Nose and tastes are an odd combination of sweetness and some funky character. Some bitterness, a little spice and some alcohol. A strange and odd marriage of a bunch of flavors which don't work at all well for me. I'd describe it as a bit of an alcohol laden mess to be honest.

Pour is a simple dark brown pour with almost no head or lace. Essentially, across the board all I get is a delicious toffee taste. Lovely rich, caramel notes. The beer is very sweet, but this bottle is a few months old and fellow BA pghlee suggested that the small amount of age on this has made it more drinkable than it was when it was a bit younger. ABV is nowhere to be seen.
OK, I admit I don't want a few 20 oz imperial pints of this stuff, but a 6-10 oz pour as a desert beer would really hit the spot for me. Very rich (obviously), very sweet (duh!) but considering what we are dealing with here the drinkability is huge.

Good black color and a decent head. Lace is pretty good. Body is a touch on the thin side but does not seriously detract from the brew.
Nice bitter coffee notes permeate the air but the taste is a little milder. A touch of alcohol there as well, but pretty nicely balanced. Smoothly comes together. Actually in the final analysis the mild alcohol burn is what I remember most.
I like this more than I thought that I would, and if this were given a chance, I think many would enjoy this.

Would definitely categorize this as a hoppy tripel rather than a Belgian IPA. The sweetness is certainly a big factor with some distinct Belgian type candy notes. It also has the Tripel alcohol, but it lacks much (if any) of the white pepper notes that we might expect. The hop bitterness is very much in the back for me.
A tasty beer and perhaps a sign of better things to come from Sweetwater, but why, oh why, oh why do we need a 10% beer? What about a special release that is sessionable?? Drinkability suffers for me as a result."

Very light grassy, organic and floral type hops that greet the nose and palate simultaneously. Nice, easy going package upfront. Tasty and simple are the watch-words here.
Mild hop bite in the back end with a reserved dry character.
This does hit a nice note in as much as the package is relatively reserved and in that respect it sort of reflects the ""British"" angle. Obviously the alcohol seems a little on the high side if you are looking for something truly sessionable, and because of it the beer seems to have a slightly slick mouthfeel. In that regard it was a minor disappointment. Ho hum, I guess you can't have everything.
All in all a decent beer but I just wish we could get the ABV down to create a better mouthfeel and drinkability to the whole deal."

From the 22oz bottle into a small Wellington glass, the pour is very dark brown with a surprisingly good head for the ABV. Some lace and some nice legs as well.
Essentially, this beer boils down to being an extremely hoppy, high alcohol American BW which I suppose is good since that's what it's supposed to be! However, with it comes a pretty cloying mouthfeel and a whole bunch of sweetness as well. This reminds me very much of a West Coast DIPA, and it is difficult to distinguish much between it and a typical American hopped-up version of that style.
Pretty nice example form the style, but I've grown a little tired of the constant assault on the tastebuds from these kind of beers. For me, that seriously subtracts from the drinkability but still allows high scores in other areas. Sip it, share and you'll be happy."

Nose is really that of the one that you usually associate with a bigger, west coast DIPA - all sugary, resinous notes.
DEFINITELY an American IPA in terms of its bitterness. A real, peppery bite throughout the beer and not much subtlety about it. It's OK because it is balanced with some good caramel malts, but it still stings a little in the finish.
A touch slick in the mouth, and together with the fact that this seems to drink above the advertised ABV both take away from the drinkability a little.

The nose is by FAR the most interesting element to this brew. As others noted at the tasting, there was a VERY distinct, rich and bright tangerine nose to this beer. Very pronounced almost to the point of me wodering if there was an orange essence added!
After the nose we just get another American double IPA. Not resionus and piney like a west coast version but just very bitter and somewhat unbalanced. Bitterness is not very well balanced and I end up havinenough after a fairly conservative volume of the beer.

Slightly murky, dark brown pour with some reddish highlights. In better light it settles to be a brownish, cranberry color. Nice looking head but it is short lived and leaves no lace. A slightly pinkish tinge (perhaps that's just my imagination!)
Faint raspberry in the nose, but it seems to manifest itself as a slightly powdery, cocoa/drinking chocolate notes as well.
Light mouthfeel that really takes this away from the stout genre for me and takes it closer to a raspberry flavored porter in my book. Nevertheless very tasty with a mild fruit note that sits very easily giving me an acidic juxtaposition to the malty, light bitterness of the brew.

Nice, clouded ornage pour with a smallish, bubbly, light head. Not much head to speak of but it does leave a very nice sticky lace on the glass. Considering the ABV it's a pretty good looking effort.
Nice combo of sweet sugars, alcohol and hops in the nose. As expected.
Alcohol is not really HUGELY upfront but it still seems a little hot. To be honest I think this is simply a function of the style rather than the particular beer. In fact, on reflection, although not as sweet as an English BW, this drinks quite a lot more like the English version rather than the often, overly hoppy American version of the style. in that respect I quite like it. Certainly compared to the Vermonster (consumed in the same tasting) it is nowhere near as hoppy. Obviously a little slick in the mouth but that's to be expected.

I'm a bit confused with this. It reminds me a bit of the Jolly Pumpkin nonense where Brett ends up in beers where it simply shouldn't be. Here the Brett in the nose and the taste compete with the Belgian sweetness and yeast and as a result we end up wih a bit of an odd beer. The total package doesn't meld all that well for me and I end up confused and disappointed with the beer as a whole.
I dunno, drinkability suffers and I get a bit annoyed with brewers tinkering with style where it's just NOT necessary. VERY infrequently do we get a major success and more often than not we end up with a unhappy marriage.

Right off the top those RR growlers are just superb to look at! For me, that's where the joy sort of ends.
I think it is difficult to even consider the American Wild Ale style since I currently feel it is pretty ill-defined. So, as a result some may feel that this review is not fair because it is not considering the style but when (as I feel) the style is poorly defined, I think that it's OK to give an honest opinion based upon the beer standing alone.
Dead pour, but nice garnet color. Nose it simply sinus clearing acid notes. The taste to me is reminiscent of a light malt vinegar and not much else. The ethanoic acid is just overwhelming to me and I get very little else.
I could only manage a very small amount of this and although one might think that you could compare this to a typical Belgian sour I think it lacks the subtlety of many of those. Throw in the ABV and the less than stellar drinkability and I feel this is just not all that good."

A malty brew, this reminds me much more of an English ESB and the moniker of Winter Warmer is pretty misleading. I get very little spice at all, and the beer reminds me much more of an English Strong Ale than much else. Not really a seasonal or Winter feel about the beer at all. Plenty of simple malts against a light hop background.

Complete clarity on the pour with good carbonation, a nice, bone-white head and nice retention and lace. Tidy beer to look at.
Nose has very light hops and a soapy undertone - typical for the origin and for the style.
This is a pretty dry beer and to be honest has NOTHING to do with ""Christmas"" or ""Winter"" (at least in the American sense of the words). More reasons (as if we needed any) for this brew to be misnderstood in the USA! (By that I mean no spice elements).
Hops and the malt base are in perfect harmony here, and both are understated (more confusion for the American drinker!)
Drinkability is enormous and the subtle balance here is the key.
As I said above, this is a drier beer than many of the style and the typical, sweet maltiness is well under-played. Becasue of the balance and clever working of the style, this does NOT make the beer a hoppy one. It makes it a clever one.

Dirty brown, cloudy pour with a really good, ivory colored head. The lace (or rather lack of it) is a little disappointing but given the ABV I shouldn't be too upset!
The nose is obviously VERY strong - it is certainly bourbon based, but closer inspection with the nostrils reveals some very serious brown sugar and molasses in the aroma. Either way it makes it half way across the room!
Tastes unsurprisingly reflect the nose with extra sherry emphasis thrown in with the bourbon. Alcohol is there in the taste but is does NOT burn, and to be honest it is very well hidden.
This is an extraordinary beer because of the way it drinks. Considering the style, the bourbon and the ABV I was expecting this to be a real effort to get down, but in the end it was exactly the opoosite. Drinkability for the style and considering the vital statistics for the beer, is HUGE.

Having tried a few of the RJ Rockers line so far (and been impressed) I was happy to see this and keen to give it a whirl.
Pour is somewhat ordinary looking in terms of color (a golden macro color), but above average in terms of head and lace.
Nose is an interesting combination of faint cinnamon and a bunch of other spices. This carries through to the tastes where we get an solid but subtle arrangement of Winter Warmer tastes with mixed spice, cinnamon and orange peel all coming through nicely. It is VERY well balanced and has a very light touch in the mouth but still manages to be satisfying.
The REALLY interesting thing about this beer is that it combines the typical spices of a Winter Warmer in a lager like body and background. Normally you'd expect this array of tastes in a darker malt based ale so it makes for a pretty unusual, if not unique beer.
Another strong brew from an increasingly impressive stable. Someone is doing something right in the early days of this emerging player. I'm going to be taking a close interest in their future."

Frankly this drinks like a maple nut or honey infused brown ale. There were words on the label that said something like ""infused with natural flavors"" - a bit of a worry to me. Fairly astringent caramel flavor which seems artificial.
Good clarity on the pour, nice head and really it looks nice. Has a sweet taste that seems like honey to me, but it is pretty sweet whatever it is. Won't be to everyones taste.
A little aftertaste in the finish.

Aggressive pour leads to a nice formed, fluffy head with some really good lace. This sits on top of a golden body with excellent clarity. Carbonation is low, but perhaps a function of the beer being a little older than I would normally be drinking it.
For some reason, the initial tastes remind me of a 1980's Whitbread Pale Ale - no idea why. Very bready and malty up front with a nice hop bitterness. This gives way to a sweeter finish than the initial tastes would suggest. It also come with some extra fruity notes and a little white pepper. Almost tripel like. 
Finishes strong with more alcohol present than up front. Drinks nicely and easily.
Very tasty and a nice interpretation. I enjoyed it."

Interesting one this. The first pint that I was given had a very nasty, plastic taste about it. I was pretty sure it was line cleaner which is ironic given what the line cleaner is supposed to do. The bar manager Ben was called, and he pulled a full pitcher off and the resulting pint was very tasty. Just a little effort is all that it generally takes.
Chestnut brown pour with very nice clarity. The head is a little too small for me, and the retention and lace were both poor. With a better head this would be a really nice looking pint.
Some initial waves of caramel sweetness and malt (as I would expect), but VERY surprisingly this essentially becaomes quite a little hop bomb. Nothing spectacular of course, but noticeable, citrus dry character and a fairly bitter note in the finish and aftertaste. Feels a touch ""West Coast IPAey!""
VERY surprised by the hoppy nature of this brew and it is fairly well put together. After the initial problem with the pint this drank rather nicely. A happy experience and one i was not expecting."

What an EXTRAORDINARY experience!
ALARMING purple pour with no head and virtually no lace.
Considering that this is supposed to be a fruit beer, there is virtually no nose - I mean NOTHING. I suppose at least there is no nasty, skunk but nevertheless one would expect more. 
When it comes down to it this is simply ""fruity"" and sweet. It certainly doesn't feel as though the beer has a particular blueberry note, but is does have a generic fruit element and it certainly has a residual sweetness. 
Also astonished by the 8% ABV - admittedly is DOES seems a little higher than your standard macro lager, but at the same time the alcohol is very well hidden.
Beer that women will love, but most men will not like. This is a super sweet brew that I quite like! Amazing isn't it!?!? Drinkable (as long as you don't mind really sweet stuff), but in the end I think it was a decent fruit beer. Is it a classic Belgian Lambic? Certainly not, but I might even go there again!

Not a very clean beer. The finish DOES have a characteristic bitter Pils edge but outside of that it drinks quite poorly.
Tannin seems to come through in the finish as well.
Not an impressive beer to me at all, nor does it seem like a classic Pils. It seems old and tired as much as anything else, and in terms of the style that is a BIG problem. In a Pils I need freshness and a lively edge with youth and character. This has none of those attributes. Poor."

Very standard in most respects. Nice, clean looking pour with good clarity, mid-gold color and a decent if not very well retained head. 
Malts dominante up front but as expected this fades to give a bitter, hop finish. Clean and unspectacular might be the best way to describe this.

Straight into the Ommegang chalice with a deliberately aggressive pour on my part. Clarity is good, but it is a very pale, macro lemony color. Head is gone quite quickly and the lace left behind is minimal.
Nose is fairly sweet with sinus clearing alcohol and a little spice.
Soft esters greet the taste with a little warming solvent alcohol too. The ester fruits are not very well defined and the alcohol bitterness hits agsin in the finish. Definite Belgian sugar candy notes and a very mild touch of Wit like spice. It's quite thin, and lacks depth in all areas. The mouthfeel is the poorest impression of a genuine Belgian and the other characteristics also fall a little short.

Interesting brew this, mainly because it has the name and the appearance that would suggest that it is one of the infamous ""Golden Ales"" that have grown up in England over the last few years as dumbed down, traditional English Bitters. HOWEVER, despite the appearance (which is decidedly in the Golden Ale category), this beer drinks as a definite, standard English Bitter to me.
A yellowish appearance with nice, bubbly head and a decent spread of lace, the challenger nose is distinct. The tastes are obviously malt based, but the crystal malt that's in the beer gives it a deceptive look. It drinks a with a greater caramel note than the color would suggest.
Light floral hops complete the package. ""Sessionable""? I suppose (without being a session beer), but approaching 5% there are still plenty of beers with more scope than this on a hot day.
Bit of an odd one - it's a better beer than the name or the appearance would suggest!"

The appearance of this beer always confuses me a little - much darker than I always expect. Almost has a Dunkel hue. Cloudy, and the head is not as impressive as some in the style. In the Tucher Weizen glass it looks orange more than yellow.
Standard yeast, clove and banana/bubble gum nose with the emphasis on the yeast as far as my nose can tell. Carbonation is fine (in terms of bubble size) but active. Mouthfeel fairly standard.
The tastes are toward the hard, acidic esters rather than the softer banana and pineapple end of of the spectrum. I get apples with a little bit of cider character. Finish is short and brisk.
I feel that this beer has changed in character somewhat over the years. I have no idea if there are new components to the beer or the brewing process, but it seems a little harder and more clinical than I once remember it. Of course, nostalgia and memory are strange things, so perhaps not. Either way I am less inclined to drink this than I once was.

22 oz bomber, the original.
Thanks go out to....
Jet black, Guinness colored body that lacks the presence of almost any red or brown highlights. Minimal head and lace that falls down to form a thin film on the surface of the beer. Nice color, but outside of that not exactly a stunning appearance.
Nice roasty, nutty nose.
Very smooth and drinkable, and in fact these are definitely the greatest assets of this brew. An almost RIS like taste in terms of the alcohol taste and richness. Light molasses but with a clean edge but it still comes across as sweet - I like it. It grows on me as it warms and as the 22 oz disappear!
Nice stout that is drinkable more than anything else but surprises me a little with its lofty BA ""top 100"" entry."

Worry lack of ""pop"" on opening and this lack of carbonation is overwhelming experience. It is so severe I am wondering if this is a problem with the bottle or the batch. Anyway, there's obviously no way of knowing. Lack of carbonation means little head and no lace.
Dark coke-like pour which is largely lifeless. Nose is very nice with some very rich, light alcohol, sherry filled character. it promises much, but ultimately the taste is not as good as the smell would suggest. Nose is the best part of this beer.
Tastes are quite licorice like with some dark, dark treacle. Some charcoal residual bitterness and a smokey, burned finish. Although the tastes do not reach the promise of the nose they are still fine, but the real problem here is the lack of carbonation and the slightly thin mouthfeel. Aftertaste takes on a yeasty, Marmite note!
Ultimately very disappointing for me, and expenive to boot. Not really happy with this one, HaandBryggeriet can do much better."

This beer is definitely almost crossing over into Belgian IPA country for me. A distinct, orange peel marmalade note is the predominant flavor and it's delcious. Tart and bitter nature lingers in the finish. The sweet and sour notes intensify as the beer warms.

Pretty much exactly what I expected which is a very good thing. 
The pour is excellent with a lovely orange amber body, a high head and some serious head retention and creamy, broken, dripping lace. Carbonation is just about perfect.
Rather than entering into a long description about the beer it's probably best to describe it in terms of styles. The American Pale Ale style has the potential to be bland, but this is hopped up enough to break that stranglehold of mediocrity. Even at these relatively low levels, the hops are still amped above the the level of an English Bitter, but in combo with the APA style it comes out to be a dry version of a typical English beer. Having read a lot about ths beer I figured that's what would happen. I had confidence mainly becasue of the quality of Bear Republic - they did not disappoint.
Finishes a little more bitter, a little more floral, a little more hoppy and a little drier than a malt based English bitter, but in terms of an American beer it comes really close. I like it a LOT, and I have to take what I can get here in the USA. It reminds me a little of a Courage Best bitter from the late 80's/early 90's with a bit of soap in the ending.

I've been drinking this for a few years now, time for a review.
Classic, light chill-hazed orange body with a small head but better lace than the head would suggest. 
Nose and tastes have that very distinctive Lagunitas hop sweetness that can be a little overwhelming. Very floral.
Sweetness lingers and there is a bit of an odd floral note in there too.
It's a very distinctive beer which requires a certain hankering for me before I reach for one. Floral fits the bill for the description in one word."

22oz bomber with the usual Stone screen printed bottle. Thanks go out to BA PatronWizard for the chance to try this one. Stone special releases have not yet made it to GA.
Very nice, light golden pour with the very lightest hint of haze in the clear body. Head is above average but light but it does leave decent lace. Looks strong. Has a Tripel appearance.
Nose is hoppier and more IPAish than the beer drinks. The nose points more toward the West Coast IPA function of the name rather than the Belgian part.
Very smooth and really quite sweet. The hop edge only comes in at the end and in the aftertaste.
Very tasty and easy drinking and pulls off a very nice combo of styles in this relatively newly established hybrid slot."

Half gallon, well sealed screw-top growler with the ""Draught House Bar and Brewpub"" advertised on the the clear glass in white lettering. From what I have read from the other reviews, this is because the brewery does not do growler fills so this beer has to be sourced at bars that do fill a growler. (As an aside, I WISH we had growler fills in GA).
The appearance of the beer within the growler is frankly a little uninspiring. A honey, old gold cloudy affair that looks pretty much exactly like four pints of unfiltered apple juice! Looks flat; I was a little concerned. However, the pour into the 500 mL Tucher Weizen glass induces the head and lace that I was expecting and makes the beer look so much better in the smaller volume.
Typical clove and mild spice in the nose. 
Not sure if I'm in the minority here, but the sum of the parts of this beer seems to be its strength. The flavors are not THAT exceptional (the usual mild clove and sweet bananas compete for your attention) but they do come together very well to give a very pleasant drinkability. Much smoother in the mouth and easier to drink than many of the style.
I really enjoyed the simplicity of this beer, and there is no doubt that it is very tasty and exceptionally drinkable, but #24 (at the time of writing) on the ""Best of BA"" list seems a little optimistic to me. Nevertheless well worth the effort of getting it (thanks Daniel), and I would recommend trying it."

Chill-hazed, dark brown appearance with hints of red clarity. Nice, well formed egg-shell head. Good retention and lace.
All the components of a solid bock are present with dominant (but balanced) malt backbone and a hint of hoppy bitterness. More like a double bock than a straight up bock to me.
I have no idea if the advertised ABV is correct, if it is it drinks WELL below that number and in that respect is a little dangerous!
All in all a very tasty and well balanced beer that I was impressed with. Add the charity component and you have a real winner IMO."

Simple, clear and orangey/red/mid-brown pour with minimal head and lace. In fact, carbonation this low reminds me of a cask ale (a good thing).
This brew pretty much nails the style nicely. Good, sweet malts are supported with some subtle bitternes for balance. Nicely rounded in the mouth (which I always feel is an important feature of the Marzen type brews). According to the blurb this was brewed in the taditonal style in as much as it was made in March and then lagered until October. It shows. Nice caramel finish rounds the beer out rather well.
One of the better brews that Max does, I'd visit it again with pleasure."

$8.99 for the 16.9 floz bottle from Arbor Place Beverage, Douglasville, GA, USA.
Pours HUGE at first giving a mountainous espresso like, fine bubbled head. This recedes quickly to leave (disappointingly) no lace. Nice fine and small mocha head sits atop the jet black, Guinness like body. Each new pour from the bottle leads to more enormous head and this gets a little annoying.
Nose is mildly roasty, but not much, and if anything is slightly acidic with some lactose notes. This gets repeated a little in the tastes, as the mild roast gives way to an almost milk stout like finish. A little hop bitterness in there too, but this is a pretty restrained beer in terms of bitterness.
Light mouthfeel as opposed to much creaminess. Finishes with more of that mild, lacto acidity.
A little atypical I would suggest, but nevertheless very tasty. Like a thin milk stout."

OK, golden urine appearance that is well carbonated but produces a terrible head and no lace. What a shocker! I smell nothing.
The taste is a slighly odd chlorinated one. Not sure if it is a citrus base or not but it seems a little lemony. Nasty corn and vegetable mix with an unpleasant aftertaste too.
To be brutally honest the most disappointing aspect for me is the PURE marketing nature of this brew. It's clearly manufactured and pitched to a particular demographic with no thought for the beer as beer. I should know better than to be disappointed by this fact, but there you go."

Dark brown pour with a lovely head and that classic, spotty, creamy quad lace on the surface of the beer and on the glass. Into the Ommegang chalice. 
Wow, what a combo. Close to perfect in terms of the style, taste, mouthfeel and nose. 
Creamy body with very light and fine carbonation. Nose and tastes combine to give the magical touch of high alcohol, deep fig and date type fruits, alcoholic esters and light burn. Sherry after-notes linger and the beer pulls it all together in the aftertaste. It is possible that the hop presence is about a tenth of a notch above where it should be, but that would be typical of Mikkeller when they mimic styles from other countries. In some instances they have got that wrong, but here it works well and is so close to the original style that it matters little anyway.
It's a beer of Westvleteren 12 quality which should tell you all you need to know.
High drinkability and high quality are the main points here. I'd like to sip this one over a two hour period before dinner, in the Spring, outside a typical cafe in Bruges or Lille. Delicious."

Hazy, orange/golden pour as expected and a disappointing head and lack of lace. Rather weak looking.
Nose and tastes have mild bananas but not much else. Authentic for the style, but lacks much depth and feels watery and lightweight to me.
Pretty weak overall offering from a brewery that can do better IMO.

This is one of two bottles that I have rescued from a couple of relatively obscure stores in the last couple of years. One came from Showcase Beverage in Carrollton, GA, USA.
355 mL bottle, foiled, capped and corked. Dimpled champagne style mini green bottle - love the presentation.
Not an especially lively pop on opening, nor is the appearance stunning, but better follows. The body is a simple mid-orange with lots of floaties but not much carbonation.
The nose is more Saison like than anything else; plenty of mild funk but nothing extraordinary.
Musty notes greet the palate at first, but this is quickly followed by the usual Lindemans sweetness. A few lemon grass notes and some mild but simple acidity.
Interesting stuff as usual. I guess that most hardcore Lambic and Gueuze fans simply don't consider this to be much like the real McCoy, but even WITH the sweetness that is so characteristic of Lindemans, this comes across with a certain charm and authenticity. It's drinkability is HUGE especially since the style tempers some of the usual sugary notes.

Very surprised by this. I was expecting much more of a hoppy (and importantly for the stlye) drier affair here, perhaps even something that resembled a DIPA. However what I got was much more reminiscemnt of an American Barleywine.
Alcohol is quite well hidden which is not necessarily a good thing. It means the alcohol creeps up on you a bit and leaves a warmth!
Decent lace above a cloudy copper body. Sweetness cuts across the brew in a slightly unbalanced manner with a wierd hoppy character that I'm not keen on. The beer is a bit of a malty mess with VERY ill-defined character.
Not my idea of an Amber and the product overal was very disappointing. Ill defined boundaries make this feel soupy and old. Less than impressive. I'd like an amber with better clarity and significantly better definition. A lower ABV would work well too."

Decent dark brown pour with some ornage highlights at the edges. A pretty nice head straight out of the bottle, but retention and lace (although there) are not what it initially promised.
Nose reveals a little sweet nuttiness and some plenty of malts.
Mouthfeel is a little thin but the body and tastes are nicely balanced in a simple way. Although the alcohol is nicely hidden, I'd still think this beer would do better between 3 and 5% rather than up near 7%. Pretty smooth and well rounded with a small hop bite in the finish. Aftertaste is a typical, moreish linger well-balanced malt and hop merge.
Essentially this looks, tastes and drinks like an English Brown Ale to me.

Here we go with #3 in the Side Project series. Somewhat disappointed by the first two in the series so I hope that this is better.
A viscous looking pour that likes like a golden, honey colored Hefe. Small head and not much lace. Smells like a Hefe too. Slick mouthfeel. Some cloves in the nose. 
On to the taste. Medicinal wheats and a warming finish. Dry, alcoholic aftertastes. Quite sweet that I would not describe as honey based, but it's certainly sugary. The honey is more obvious in the appaearance in terms of color. 
Drinkability is very poor for me. In fact, half the bottle was a drain pour. I just don't want 11% beers in that quantity very often and the sweetness is just too much even for me, a person that enjoys sweet brews.
(Being VERY careful not let the following effect my review of THIS beer, I think it is a dreaful shame that Terrapin has not used the Side Project series to showcase a sessionable, simple bitter or at least something with a more reasonable ABV. that would be a refreshing change)."

Pretty much a standard mediocre Czech dark beer. Probably doesn't travel very well and I'd imagine that closer to the source this would be a much better bet.

Pour in one go into the Ommegang chalice. Body is a honey colored orange with a distinct coudiness present and some serious floaties - typical for the bottle conditioning. Thin, soapy film forms on the surface of the brew. Looks solid.
Honey and medicinal yeasts cut across the nose.
Similar taste profile, but it is sweeter than the nose would otherwise suggest. Residual sweetness lingers in the finish, as does a slight white pepper note that was not present in the aroma. Honey sweetness too.
There is a touch of sweetened grapefruit juice in the mix too.
Not really a ""clean"" Belgian Pale, in as much as there is a LOT going on here. I prefer a simplier approach both in terms of appearance, and tastes and I prefer a cleaner alcohol edge in this style."

Nose is exceptional too. A beautiful, rich coffee-laden experience that is very memorable and reminiscent of a much more expensive beer.
Mouthfeel and tastes are equally memorable with a paradoxical cacophany of coffee creaminess and porter satisfaction coming together to produce a near perfect beer. Honestly the most interesting and tasty beer that I have drunk in some time.

Bags of great malts in the nose that a coupled with a sweet, cereal (oat-like) note. Reminds me of an oatmeal stout.
Mouthfeel is also very nice with smooth, fine carbonation rolling easily across the tongue. Creamy nature. Again, almost stout like.
Sweet, nutty start but then BANG the rye and hop bitterness crashes in, in a non-too subtle manner. It renders the beer intensely bitter in the finish and aftertaste in a way that one was not expecting up to that point. It REALLY bites hard - too hard for me. It gives an unpleasant burned note and it badly unbalances the brew.
The vicious bitterness at the back end of this beer destroys the drinkability for me, and it makes the beer almost completely different in the two halves of the drink. Odd."
"Weyerbacher Brewing Co.","Thirteen","","","American Double / Imperial Stout","13.6%","bottle","4","4","4","4","4","4","10/26/08","I bought three bottles of this when it first hit the GA shelves a few months ago, just getting around to opening one this evening.
22 oz bottle, $6.99 across the board in Atlanta, GA, USA.
The Weyerbacher anniversary series has a mixed reputation. Often described as being too big for their own good, they have been reported as muddled, difficult to drink and generally poorly balanced so I'm approaching this with a little trepidation and relatively no expectations. At close to 14.0% ABV, there is plenty of potential for a messy, difficult brew to say the least. We'll see.
Poured into the Terrapin 22 oz snifter in small doses, there are no surprises in the appearance. Jet black with an inky viscosity. Head is very small, lace hardly present. A few spots of coffee mocha film and swirls atop the ruby red highlighted body.
Nose is mainly a sinus clearing alcohol bomb, but despite its obvious nature, it is not horribly overpowering in the taste.
Tastes reflect the nose. It's alcohol rich, but it's drinkable. Don't get me wrong, the heat IS there but it is smoother than one would think it would be. Bitterness is in check, this reminds me of a fine Scotch. The burn is mild but definitely there! Not shocking. To say that the alcohol is ""well hidden"" would be a stretch, but it does seem manageable to me. Not an easy feat to achieve with such a massive brew.
I do not find this particularly complex just very a big alcohol bomb. Having said that, it is MUCH better than I expected. Age on this will be very interesting."

I'm always in two minds about JP; I generally like the beers that they brew AS LONG AS the style fits the funk. When I get a ""stout"" for example that has funk, then I'm annoyed. For that reason I am hoping that this beer will be a beer that I feel good about.
Decent gunsmoke on opening and some serious head. In the Terrapin snifter the rocky, snow-capped head and lace is gorgeous, but the body is MUCH darker than I was expecting. I was hoping for a golden body, but I get dirty brown Dubbel body - not that attractive.
Very typical for the JP series, but not very subtle or clever. Sour notes destroy much of the milder funk that should really accompany this style, and the dry puckering nature of the brew ties everything else up. Sourness is added to with a drying bitterness that does nothing for me. Hops fit awkwardly into the equation and the mouthfeel is thin. It grows on me a LITTLE bit as it warms, but to be honest it still fails to impress.
I dunno, another JP beer that uses an inordinate amount of sourness to eclipse the more subtle notes that should/could be present. Not much to say other than another opportunity missed. Shame."

Viscous orange pour with little carbonation and little head. Lace is scant too which is fair enough considering the ABV.
Light hops in the nose that are not overpowering. Not at all cloying in the mouth, in fact rather light.
Interesting tastes. Viscous sugar is there amongst the alcohol and hop base, but to my great surprise and delight the whole thing drinks very lightly. Not a typical DIPA; more like a DIPA ""lite""!!

Darker than expected pour from the 12oz bottle into the Allagash flute. Nice head, but it fades quickly. A little lace.
This is a surprising beer because it has an odd, American Barleywine taste to it. Hoppy and alcoholic without being too hoppy and too alcoholic! Pretty complex I thought. Not really my cup of tea but I think I would try it again and say it was worth trying. Interesting."

Significantly more of an orange/amber body than the style would normally suggest. Decent head and some lace. Lacks the typical dark notes for the style.
Surprisingly, a fruity, light nose.
The tastes are really fruity and have a crisp note about them and a nice acidity. Sharp tasting, and a nicely balanced beer.
I really like this, but to call it a Scotch Ale/Wee Heavy is a stretch to say the least. It's sweet, malty and above all fruity and to me it almost seems like a fruit beer. It has sufficient grapefruit bitterness in the finish to suggest that fruit, SPECIFICALLY!

750 mL corked & caged with a nice pop on opening and plenty of gunsmoke. Into the Sam Adams ""speciality"" glass. 8.6% on the label, 8.7% in the BA database?
Honey orange body, slightly hazed and a small but decent head. Lace is light, but dense. 
Nose and tastes match well with plenty of honey, orange and mild pepper/spice. Some banana. Finish culminates in more bitterness than the earlier part of the beer would have suggested. Quite floral and the alcohol is present both in terms of a heavy mouthfeel and a little burn in the finish. Mixed bag & complex.
I like the taste, but the slightly syrupy mouthfeel combined with the strong tastes make this a beer that is not easy to drink quickly or in quantity. Add the ABV into the equation and this is a bit of a task. It would be best shared and better with the alcohol taken down a few notches - not much chance of that in the USA!
Very tasty, but this is going to be a beer that not everyone will enjoy. A bit of a odd-ball. A floral (OK), but heavy (not OK) Wit. It's a bit of a mystery and a strange beast. The worlds first ""Imperial Wit""? If so, another style we can do without."

Tasty malts are the order of the day (as they should be for a brown ale), and surprisingly (becasue this is categorized as an AMERICAN brown) the hops are reserved. Don't get me wrong, I MUCH prefer toned down hops in my brown ales since it make sense to have a brown with malts being the dominant character, but American browns usually do exactly the opposite - this one doesn't. Couple the fact that this has the word ""Imperial"" in the name, and you have a surprising lack of bitterness. GOOD! Of course to me it was infinitely better this way than as a ""hopped-up"" brown ale.
Despite the confusion of the styling, name and finally the tastes, it all shook down to being a very enjoyable, nutty experience. Just a TERRIBLE shame that it wasn't 3-4% rather than 7-8%! Brown ales ought to be a great opportunity to give us a truly sessionable beer, but for the bazillionth time the boat is missed - SUCH a shame, and very tiresome. As a result, I marked the drinkability of this very tasty beer down.
So close to pulling off a great beer, like so many others it ultimately falls slightly short - ho hum. I suggest calling it an English Brown, taking the word ""Imperial"" out of the name and halving the ABV - then we might have a close to perfect beer."

Tastes are a really earthy, rustic feel. In fact it seems to remind my of OLD beer. It's a bit odd and it really doesn't go down that well. Alcohol is well hidden but the other tasts don't add too much.
All in all a lttle disappointing. The earthy nature keeps coming through and there is little else. Obviously a few other characteristics such as a sherry, alcohol note but it still seems a little musty. Second half of the bottle became a Brat marinade!

It's pretty simple to summarize this beer. VERY hoppy, very dry and very American in terms of ita ""American"" IPA style. Not really my cup of tea. The hops in the taste and nose are fairly astringent, and although not huge, they give a certain one-dimensionality to the beer. It's just not subtle and at the same time lacks complexity.

Pale lemon colored wheat and hazed body that hits some serious orange notes with the Autumnal, watered down GA sunlight.

Nose is malty alcohol but even on warming it reveals little.
Certainly sugary sweet presence amongst the alcohol, but the beer manages to stay away from the viscous syrup that can plague this style and beers of this ABV. Pretty well balanced and a big treat to find a SN brew that isn't simply a hop laden IPA clone of some description.

Bubblegum and banana notes meet the nose and the tastes reflect pretty much exactly what I would expect in the style. Nose and tastes match well. Drinks a little easier and cleaner than some of its German forefathers.

Someone needs to educate this chain PROPERLY.
Great clarity on the pour with some fine carbonation. A real orangey/red/amber body. IF ONLY the pour were one that induced more head this would look great. Ho hum.
A little thin in the mouth both for the style and the time of year.
Sweeter than I was expect for an Amber brew, and the nose is muted because of the temperature that it is served at, this beer was tasty. Good malts hold a mild hop profile in place and it is one of those beers that is moreish. This maybe because of the small serving size.

Big, peppery, syrupy notes that make this more of a sipper than a quaffer. Lacks drinkability, but this is not a ""knock"" on the beer, rather just an observation.

Picked this one up at Arbor Place Beverage, Douglasville, GA, USA. Capped, 750 mL bottle. The label says 9% not 10% ABV as in the BA database at the time of writing. This one goes into the DFH palm glass.
Pour is a chill-hazed lightly sparkling orange with a small head and very little lace. Looks nice.
Aroma is a pretty nondescript, vegetal corn. Not much there at all.
A few peppery notes in the taste that add to the hop/bitterness sensation, but his beer still comes off as quite sweet. I don't really detect a ""chilli/chile"" note here, at least not in the way that a Rogue Chipolte comes down. There is a peppery spice note, but it's muted. Finish is quite sweet and sugary. It's a malty brew to say the least but somehow has a odd combination of flavors and sensations. There is a little more honey as the beer warms, especially in the taste as opposed to the nose. Some tomato like flavors too - odd.
Very easy to drink and the alcohol (whether 9 or 10) is virtually undetectable. Drinkability is perhaps the strongest suit here since for such a relatively high ABV beer it really disappears quickly!
Interesting I suppose from a brewing perspective, but ultimately not as interesting to drink as it was to read about or contemplate. Tasty but not outstanding IMO, but only DFH could put together a beer like this - more power to them, I for one appreciate their style!"

Over the years I've become increasingly tired of these beers (meaning this style) with their unrelenting hop bitterness and high alcohol content which has quite literally impeded their drinkability, BUT from time to time, I feel like going back to revisit them. It's REALLY important for me to go back to a solid version, because otherwise I will get frustrated quickly. Luckily this was one such ""good"" example.
Bright orange body with an initial high, pitted head, but this fades quickly to leave no lace to speak of. A tiny bit of foam on the surface of the beer but again not much to report. Some chill haze. There is good clarity in the initial pour, but a huge amount of yeast in the bottom of the bottle that makes the final pour look like soup!
Aroma and tastes match; huge hops with cloying sweetness and grapefruit bitterness. No easy drinking here, but to expect it would be foolish.
Finish has a metallic twang and more sweetness.
As expected this is not an easy beer to drink, and any beer that dictates to the drinker that more than one is a bad idea has limited appeal in my book, but nonetheless a solid example.
I dunno, IF you a looking for a beer that fits the style this would be a good one, but it's not an easy brew; then again, no one said it would be!"

Thanks go out to Penney for the chance to try this one again; from The Foodery in Philadelphia, PA, USA.
Perhaps a little less bock character than I remember but still not especially BdG-like. Still a unique beer and to be honest this seems a LOT different to my earlier experience.
Obviously large batch differences at work here with the usual LA quality control issues.

750 mL corked & caged affair from a recent trade.
Nice pop on opening and a superb, well carbonated amber body underneath a bone-white well formed head. Nice clarity.
Nose is VERY malty - surprisingly so.
Tastes reflect that sweet breadiness and then finish a little drier than expected. Very unusual for a BdG in my opinion, this lacks those mild spices and wild character and replaces it with a malt bomb. Almost bock-like in its overall nature to me - in fact, VERY bock-like. There is a little hop nature in the finish to knock it out of real bock territory, but to be honest it remains an unlikely BdG. Darker than a BdG too.
Pretty tasty and an enjoyable drink, but if you are looking for a classic BdG look elsewhere. Marked down by me slightly because of that."

Yeasty, mild citrus spice in the nose with the emphasis on the citrus. This gets reflected in the taste. Very light orange bitterness mixed in with high drinkability and a refreshingly low ABV. Not much spice or any coriander notes, the emphasis is more on the lemon side of things.

Poured into the Sweetwater Pils glass. Nice clarity and good carbonation. Golden yellow. Nice appearance. 
Simple beer with a touch of fruit in the nose, but really drinks like a bitter, second rate pilsner. Some acidic fruit in the finish but not easy to distinguish as being Blueberry specific. An uneasy lavender like taste in the finish too.

Grainy, vegetal, macro bitterness in the nose.
Also as others have noted, the color does tend to obscure tastes a little - odd, but it does. The brain plays tricks. As you look at the beer you expected a lager & black(currant) taste.
Some dry character and some metallic bitterness. DEFINITELY plenty of lager notes too. Cracker dry notes. Not really a hop bitterness rather a metallic coinage taste.

I like the presentation. There does seem to be a slightly different shape to the bottle (compared to the ""normal"" American 12oz bottle), and the old school classic red color is nice. Rightly or wrongly, I went ahead and included an element of my appearance score to reflect the good packaging.
Apparently AB has just defined a new style - the ""American Ale""! I doubt that BA or the BJCP will agree, and this seems well suited to the American Red/Amber category. It doesn't matter to me (because I am not American), but I would think that idea that AB is constantly attempting to monopolize the ""patriotic"" or ""American"" angle in its marketing might piss off the Americans amongst you - any thoughts out there on that?
Anyway, on to the beer. Decent copper color and good clarity. Head is decent at first but does fade. Some spotty froth but no lace. Carbonation seems lacking to me.
Malty nose with a touch of hop presence but very little.
Taste has some dry character and bitterness, but it seems thin and somewhat artificial. Almost has a plastic taste mixed in there too. The finish is quite harsh with a coinage metallic nature.
I dunno, MUCH better than many things that AB puts out, but I am confused as to why they cannot grab the bull by the horns and produce a really great beer. I guess that serious beers are just not part of the buying profile of their customer demographic. Like so many American icons it's all about marketing, the market share and the $ for these guys.

Following this thread; http://beeradvocate.com/forum/read/1567156#1568258
I wanted to say this;
Just to clarify, what I was saying in the review was NOT that Americans might get upset about the use of *word* ""American"" (as Todd pointed out, loads of American brewers do that, AND it seems reasonable), rather that Americans might be upset about the fact that AB/Bud seem to be hanging an increasing amount of their identity on being *THE* American beer; almost as if they are hijacking patriotism/the USA and associating those things with their product and their product ALONE. It seems to me that is what they are doing (by implying that other BMC products are somehow less American).
My point was, does that piss you (Americans) off? If the shoe were on the other foot it would piss me off.
I guess if you disagree with my analysis of the situation as a whole, then the question is a moot one."

22 oz bottle - striking in its appearance but I don't know if I like it or not. $9.99 from Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA so I am a little worried about the value - that's pricey for a bomber.
Right off the bat this is a VERY poor ""Dopplebock"" (IF indeed that is what it is supposed to be). If the beer IS just a hyped up version of Dead Guy, then I fail to see how it can change style dramatically. I'm sceptical to say the least.
Poured into the 22 oz Terrapin snifter it provides a big head, some chill haze and a amber/copper pour. Good lace.
BIG, malty nose.
Taste is a sort of weird combo between maltiness and an odd, harsh hop bomb. Strange. Odd caramel notes and this beer seems VERY oddly placed in the grand scheme of things. Dry Red ale type finish. Bitter aftertaste.
I don't get this at all, nor do I really care for this much. It seems to fall into the trap of trying to be all kinds of things and ends up being none of them. Just not good and a TERRIBLE ""Dopplebock"" by any stretch of the imagination."

Nose and tastes are as expected with simple Belgian yeast notes, mild alcohol and sweetness in the finish. Light medicinal/herbal notes too. Some non-ripe, crunchy pears in there too. 
This is a typical Belgian strong pale but also provides a lot of light drinking character. The sweetness IS there but it is not at ALL cloying or heavy. Easy to quaff.

Lots of froth on the pour that leads to an orange body and thin head and lace.
Nose has an interesting combo of mild hops and Belgian yeast. The taste reflects that, and as such this seems like a quintessential version of the style. Bitterness in the back.
Not a huge fan of the Belgian IPA interpretations, frankly this style is generally better left to the masters - the English. Anyway, it tends to impart a somewhat medicinal note to the beer.
Body is light, which is OK as it adds to the drinkability.
Finish has a dry note and some more herbal medicine.
A decent change of pace and a good example of the style just not really my cup of tea. I'm not against these beers just find them a bit of a non-descript halfway house that sits between two stools."

Again, surprisingly good head, retention and lace. Body is a dark brown/garnet with some good red highlights scattered in there too. Super sweet nose.
Malt base here is strong (as expected) and it lays the ground work for a dryish hop background. Some mild nuttiness that finishes with an extra touch of dry character in the back. Finish re-invigorates the malt. Wow! Tasty. It's really quite sweet into the mix as well which crept up on me.

On to the review for Double Century.
Very light colored pour which at first has me worried that this s really a Golden Ale rather than a Bitter. One whiff of the hop combo in the nose leads me to believe that we have something more substantial here. Nice golden color.
Surprisingly well carbonated and a better than average head and some really good lace.
Lovely malt backbone supports a dry beer than finishes long and with surprisingly delicacy. The hops are sturdy but light. Almost floral in their nature, they dance gently on the tongue. Smooth bitterness completes the package. This is actually a pretty hoppy beer, but American palates will generally NOT agree. The understanding and role of the hop in craft brewing has shifted so far to one extreme on this side of the pond, that beer like this no longer register on many peoples taste range. No matter, those that know will appreciate the quality product that this and will enjoy it and will see the hoppy nature of the brew.
Well crafted, balanced, tasty and a better than expected average beer of its type. I'd LOVE to taste this on cask, it would probably be close to ""5's"" across the board."

750 mL corked and caged bottle from Green's on Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA. Opens with a stunning pop and some white gun smoke - impressive start.
Typical, well carbonated pour with lots of fine bubbles. Obviously this fades, but still leaves impressive lace and thin, fine head across the surface. The head is a little better than ""spotty"" and is about as good as one can expect for a beer of this style and ABV.
Great honey, gold body with continued fine and persistent carbonation.
Nose is essentially exactly as I would expect; an alcohol soaked, Belgian yeast based brew.
This is a simple beer to describe because it is the quintessential example of the style. I LOVE it when this happens. Alcohol, Belgian yeast and Belgian candy all come together in a pleasing package with a pleasing dry almost champagne like character to finish the job. Interspersed is a collection of mild, white pepper bitterness. Again, impressive. It maintains the creaminess of the mouthfeel despite the relative high carbonation.
Drinkability is off the charts for me, and part of that is the alcohol being so well hidden - don't get me wrong, its still there, but nowhere near the advertised 10%

One of the infamous ""Golden Ales"". These beers had never been heard of in England until about three or four years ago. To my mind they are dilutions of real English Bitters that are a manufactured piece of marketing that is designed to capture a small part of the macro lager swigging crowd/market. From that point of view I am against them on principle.
Having said all of THAT, they DO generally offer a drinkable, refreshing and balanced low ABV option that is tasty. This beer is no excpetion and I think that my real objection is to the style description of ""English Bitter"" - if it were me, I'd create a separate style of ""English Golden Ales"".
In terms of taste and appearance it is what it is. Simple golden body with little head or lace. It's a very lightly hopped beer that has carbonation and other lager like character. Some decent, simple malts and it is unoffensive. That's just about the best I can say for it.
At the time of writing the only other review was that of the cask version and essentially my review and it are not comparable - these are two TOTALLY different brews in these different serving styles."

If I had to describe the taste in simple terms, I would say this is a Belgian Pale/Belgian IPA/ Tripel combo. Plenty of sweetness from the Tripel element, but also dry hop character cutting across the beer to give the Belgian IPA note. Add some typical Belgian yeast character and you have a wierd and wonderful combination.
Truly an amalgam of sensations and styles. 
Stone once again produces a beer that is worth talking about. I'd prefer a traditional Belgian Pale along the lines of an American Duvel, but nevertheless this is a difficult beer to ignore - I strongly suggest that you do NOT!"

Lucky to get his one as a single. Greens has been doing a bit of this lately and I've been waiting on this particular beer for a LONG time (long before DR came to GA).
FWIW I love the metallic green color on the label.
The color is a deep garnet color that looks great. Head is a little disappointing since it fades quickly, but nevertheless it still has depth and plenty of color.
Some decent sherry and alcohol notes in the nose. More rich maltiness than I was expecting.
Big malts are the experience here (as they should be), followed by an alcohol finish and some dry character. Large, and not quite as smooth as it should be, the brew is a bit edgy. A surpisingly alcoholic notes (especially in the finish) which slightly takes the edge off the beer; it feels slightly too big for the style.
Frankly this is one of my favorite styles, but this version has an alcoholic edge that is just a little too big.
Close, but not quite great. Maybe this would benefit from some short term cellar time."

Pour is a somewhat thin looking amber/reddish orange that looks surprisingly carbonated with lots of small bubbles rising. Head is thin and fades very quickly.
Aroma seems very strongly hop based.
Hops are upfront but fade quickly. There is a lack of malt backbone which makes this feel very one dimensional. It's particularly dry as well and essentially this drinks exactly like a thin, Irish red.
DREADFUL example of an ESB (and it's a crime that it is characterized as one), and on top of that not a very interesting beer either. It lacks body in the extreme and is nowhere near the malty monster than ANY kind of ESB should be. Disappointing that Sweetwater has done a bit of a half-assed job with this one."

Mid brown pour with a better than expected head considering the cask serving. Long, drawn out nose and aftertaste that match perfectly. Malts compete with one another in a gentle competetion for your senses. Subtle beyond belief, but this adds to the drinkability. Mild hop notes that are clean and citrus based complete the package.

A simple malt based brew, typical of the style but also with (for an English beer of its type) a rather raised hop profile. Of course, the hops are more gentle, subtle and floral than one has become used to in the US, and for that it is a Godsend.

I had low expectations, but they were handsomely exceeded.
Odd looking pour from the bottle, giving and almost brown, cloudy concoction. It reminded me of an unpasteurized cider. Almost dark bloody red. Head was minimal, lace scant. Heafty whiff of cherry essence as predicted.
Very drinkable as the combo of ripe cherries and mild alcohol combine to leave a very moreish experience. Finishes with a tart, puckering acidity that is almost wiped out immediately by a rush of sugar. Actually nicely balanced.

Nice clarity in the dark orange body that has a good head initially and a decent head. However, the head fades quite quickly and leaves very little lace.
OK, it's called Alpha King for a reason, and there is not much subtlety in the nose or the tastes in this beer. Because of the enormous hop presence, this beer does drink MUCH more like an IPA than a ""Pale Ale"". Outside of the hop presence there is very little else EXCEPT the fairly large does of diacetyl. That combination seems to lead to a pretty one dimensional beer - it's not a bad beer, but it IS pretty one dimensional. The lack of subtlety and complexity surrounding this beer slightly surprises me given its high ranking in the BA top 100 - strange, perhaps some ""overrating"" going on here?
A bit slick in the mouth too. Anyway, big fresh pine hop notes that remind me of toilet cleaner aromas and you get the picture. Just an average beer for my money and that whole diacetyl thing really hurts this brew."

Slightly strange beast this.

Serious carbonation on opening with a real gusher going on for a few minutes. Mocha foam.
Dubbel pour (i.e. mid brown, cloudy and rather drab) with a small head and a little lace. This IS Dubbel ""like"", but it lacks the Belgian candy and yeast element to yield a rather odd brew. It sort of sits on my palate somewhere between a Brown Ale, a Dubbel and a Bock. All very odd. It has some residual sweetness and sugar that inserts the Bock thing for me.
I liked it better than I like most Dubbels since it seemed sweeter and less BLAH. It is certainly not a classic Belgian Dubbel by any stretch, and it seems to have a sugary note that repeats itelf in the finish too.

Aroma and tastes are all black cherries, and a nice, non-artificial one at that. Obviously this is crushingly sweet, and to be honest I really like it - many will hate it. A little tart i the finish which gives it the genuine cherry fruit note.
Very smooth.
There really isn't much more to be said about this other than it is just about the perfect girly, brunchy, deserty non-serious beer. The drinkability is off the charts AS LONG AS you are not offended by the sweetness."

22 oz bomber as part of a sampling at The Brick Store courtesy of Dave. Simple brown body with disappointing head and lace.
Malty beer (obvioulsy) but the overwhelming notion that I left with was a lack of body. Watery? No, but for the style it lacked depth. Alcohol presence seemed a little above the 7.00% too, which gave it an edge that I was not looking for.
Lacked smoothness for me which IMO is a critical characteristic of the style. My first adventure with French Broad and although OK, lacked satisfaction. Onward and upward, and hopefully their other offereings will excite me more."

Superb color on the pour which I would describe as a deep burned orange color. Head is initially high but fades to not much. Lace is decent. If the head had lingered more I would have given this a 5 for appearance.
Definitely a Bock beer - there's just no mistaking that rich, malty goodness, but this has some other interesting elements. Firstly there seems to be a slightly peppery, spicy note in the finish. At first I mistook this for a bitter, alcohol twang but it seems to linger and as it does it adds credence to the ""spice"" theory! Quite odd. there is a richness to the mouthfeel that I think always comes with the best Bock beers and their malty density. Honey is there too.
Nose and the underlying tastes are all connected to the malt base and they are there in abundance, but this beer delivers something extra. I'm not at all sure exactly what it is, but it certainly adds to the experience.
A tasty beer without doubt, and worth seeking out."

I *think* that this had the words ""Oatmeal Brown Ale"" on the can (whatever that is!)
Anyway, on to the beer. Disappointing lack of pop on opening the can and this turned out to be a theme running through the sampling. Rather lifeless and lacking in carbonation. Not a huge problem for the style, but it seemed so low that I began to notice it.
Simple brown pour that lacks much head at all, and doesn't offer any lace or life. 
Once you get past the somewhat shallow look, this is actually a very solid and tasty beer. Good malts support the mid-range hop bitterness and kick in to end nicely (as per the style). I like this beer becasue it does what all brown ales should - it gives a feeling of moreishness. That feeling that you get when you feel that you could just keep drinking these. Mellow, simple ABV and malt smoothness complete the picture.

2009 Vintage 06/10 - NO SCORES WERE CHANGED AS A RESULT OF THIS REVIEW/THESE NOTES. SCORES BASED ON ORIGINAL REVIEW
===
Opened as a result of the BA thread suggesting possible infections in the 2009 bottles and sent the following summary to Gary at Deschutes.
No gusher, so I had high hopes. The nose was slightly off, but nothing that stopped me from pouring the beer and drinking some. There WAS definitely an increased level of acidity and a slightly lacto note, BUT I would not have called it ""infected"". My experience with infected beer has been a cider-like, strong apple taste. The beer did not exhibit that. In fact, were I drinking (or expecting) a milk stout, it could be argued that this beer would have been within the limits of acceptability, but of course I don't think that was what was supposed to happen here.
The REALLY disappointing thing was the body. It was very thin and watery and not at ALL like the Abyss that I know and love. I drain-poured about 75% of the bottle since I didn't want to risk an upset stomach, not because it was undrinkable.
Anyway, I don't think that the beer is currently as intended but I'm not sure that it is infected.
*
Gary's reply;
*
Thanks Ding,
First, there is nothing in the beer that should make you sick.
Second, we frequently use a lactic culture to add acidity to our beers, Abyss included.
What we are thinking is the barrel aging process could add some wild yeasts that, under the right circumstances, could grow to the level of sensory.
Again, if anyone is unhappy with the product, as with all our products, please contact us through our website and we will process refunds. We are very interested in getting back unopened bottles as well so we can thoroughly test them and try and figure this thing out. Some of our lab tests are coming back, but many will not be back for a little while yet.
I hope this helps.

Thanks go out to russpowell for the chance to try this one via a not so recent trade! Been sitting on it for a while, now is the time to crack it. 2007 vintage.
Poured into the 22 oz Terrapin snifter. Obviously an inky black pour with a lovely mocha head and a touch of lace. NOT the best lace or head that I have ever seen (even for the style), but still good. Some legs in the glass - NICE!
Nose has a sweet molasses with a burned coffee and toffee background note. Alcohol seems aggressive in the nose.
The mouthfeel is interesting. It has a full, chewy nature with a creamy touch. It is not overpowering or viscous.
On to the taste. There is certainly a licorice element, but it melds perfectly with the style. It lends a certain bitterness and sweetness which is just perfect. If you think about it, very much like coffee, it is a natural taste that lends itself perfectly to the roasted malts that you find in the style. Tremendous! A little solvent like alcohol in the VERY back, and as such the alcohol is much less prominent that in the nose would suggest. Aftertaste has a coffee grind bitterness, but this is really an afterthought.
A delight, and super brew. I am not necessarily (or easily impressed) with many ""top ten"" beers, but this one certainly deserves its billing. Very nice and highly recommended."

Grainy sweetness meets the nose along with a ""strongish"" alcohol presence, but it seems in check and balanced.
Very smooth, Belgian Strong Pale sweet, alcohol presence, but it is a bit more alcohol based, and obviously a lot less Belgian in terms of yeast and candy content. Finishes with a light ""bitter"" element, but even this is sugar based.

Good pop on the removal of the cork, and a little white gun smoke. Poured into the Terrapin snifter, the color is a mid orange (Olde English marmalade color) with a decent 1/8th inch, fine bubbled head on the surface of the beer. A smidgen of lace.
Nice farmyard manure in the nose. Mouthfeel is a little more prickly that I was expecting with quite a high carbonation; ""fizzy"" may be an exaggeration, BUT putting ones ear to the beer reveals are pretty loud and noticeable ""crackle"".
Very clean, grapefruit like acidity upfront with some serious tartness. Unusually the sour notes do not linger much, and the beer ends cleanly to yield some yeast in the aftertaste.
It's definitely a beer for the experienced drinker rather than the novice, but having said that this is a very approachable beer for the style. I must admit I was expecting something much more aggressive and I was pleasantly surprised. I'm guessing that at 8 years old, this has been treated well by time, and when it was younger it may have had some of the traits that I was a little wary of. The aging process has taken this from the potentially harsh Gueuze to the edges of the more approachable Saison. Interesting and well worth a try."

Picked this can (as pictured on BA) up for 50 cents at Track One between East Point and West End on the less glamorous side of Atlanta, GA, USA. Good value - just!
OK, here's the deal. You could have knocked me over with a feather when I saw this can. Carling Black Label is a brand that I grew up with in 1970's (and also the early 80's) England. Not that I was drinking it, mind you, but it was a HUGE, HUGE beer at that time in the UK. I remember the jingle from the advert (commercial for you US BA's), and I remember the ""pump"" on the bars in pubs, and I remember the whole concept - just type ""Carling Black Label"" into a YouTube search and you'll find the classic, ""I bet he drinks Carling Black Label"", and ""Your best bet for a fuller flavor""! Happy memories...anyway, on to the beer...
Now, I'm not naive enough to know that this may be a completely different beer from years ago. What with mergers, buyouts, contract brewing, and general globalization, who the hell really knows what kind of relationship what is in the glass in front of me has to the draft versions of 1979 in England??
Pour is over carbonated with a very light head and some very thin, ugly lace. ""Body"" is one of the lightest colored I can remember seeing - ever! Head dies to give nothing, and you have a classic, low quality American macro lager sitting in front of you.
Just the usual in terms of taste and body. Thin, thin, thin, with some serious corn and veggie elements and the whole thing is horribly average even by macro lager terms.
Just about what I expected, but this did give me a massive blast of nostalgia, and a 50 cents a can I could not go wrong! Glad I came across this."

This one has been sitting in the DBF for a long time, but I am happy to report, that (as expected), this has aged beautifully. Notche (approx.) best before April 08.
Jet black pour and a huge, mocha head, this basically looks like a BIG RIS. (It lacks the depth of mouthfeel of a RIS, but outside of that it resembles one in many other ways). Head is beautifully maintained, creamy and produces some great lace.
Lots of roasted chocolate notes in the nose and taste. It does have a little hoppy edge that certainly makes it an ""American"" rather than an original Porter, but I can live with that (just!) VERY mild smoke, but smooth and clean - delicious!
If you are looking for a classic English porter, with a classic America twist (more hops) then this is a quintessential brew. Look no further. I'd prefer a creamier mouthfeel and less hops to bring it back to a ""real"" porter, but nevertheless this is a classic of a non-classic style."

As expected, very little ""pop"" on opening. Carbonation on the pour is nearly zero.
Poured into the Brasserie de l'Abbaye des Rocs chalice the beer has a dark magenta/blood red color that is completely opaque. Completely bereft of carbonation or head. 
Nose and taste lack much SPECIFIC cherry presence, rather they combine to yield an acidic/tart combination of ""fruitiness"" that lacks definition to me. Finishes with vinegar like acidity.
I dunno, even after years and years of drinking these Lambic beers, AND knowing exactly what to expect, AND understanding the whole Lambic ""thing"", I just don't find these beers especially drinkable. I am beginning to think it's a big con, along the lines of the Emperors new clothes! ;-). having said that, I think a lot of the problems with this particular beer could be erased with age. At less than three years old I think this is simply way too young."

$3.95 for the 11.2 oz bottle form Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Nasty looking pour - dirty brown Dubbel appearance. Looks like dirty, ditch/dish water. Head is short lived and no lace in the Duvel tulip. Looks drab.
Big sweet Belgian candy notes and a touch of yeast complete the nose. The aroma is the best part of this beer.
Tastes are mild caramel with a little residual sweetness alongside some chewy malts. A little alcohol in the finish, but this drinks well below the advertised 9%.
Not really much of a Tripel in my book, all the way from the appearance to the taste. Way too ""muddy"" and ill-defined for me and for the style. Disappointing."

Chris, I owe you. A rare chance (these days) to get into a BA Top 100 beer; #28 currently and it's welcome!
The beer demands my full attention, so I pour the 330 mL bottle into the Terrapin 22 oz snifter (seems like the perfect glass) in three separate portions, I also pour a large glass of fresh, cold water alongside it and I settle down to enjoy the experience.
Jet black pour with an impressive initial head on pouring that settles to a dense, 1/4 inch, perfectly formed espresso like film across the surface of the beer.
The aroma hits me from about 18 inches away. The main smell is a very dark (plain), high cocoa percentage chocolate.
The beer starts with a fairly rich, alcohol laden, slight bitterness. The initial beauty of the brew is the way that is holds a delicious balance. It really prods at the edges of bitterness and high alcohol BUT at the same time it still manages to stay within acceptable boundaries - quite a feat, it treads a fine line AND pulls it off. Although the alcohol is there, in terms of 13% it's amazingly well-hidden. Some really tasty light acidic fruit in there as well. It's complex and very well balanced.
Halfway through the beer I grabbed a Black Forest Truffle - the perfect complement to this exceptional beer. A lovely brew that is smooth, very rich and perfectly balanced."

Very pale, light orange pour with a light, bubbly smallish head and some lace. Looks light and though it won't have much body.
Some malts up front, but this is quickly followed by a dry, citrus hop finish. To be honest it tastes a little on the artificial side, almost as if hop essence has been added - rather odd.
Light body. Although this really isn't much of a beer, at least it has some bitterness that takes it beyond a nasty BMC macro lager so it might do in a pinch. Outside of that redeeming quality there is little else here - expect very little and you'll be OK."

What have we here? An English Dark Mild?? I doubt it, but we'll see.
Pour is good revealing a pretty decent head a little lace. Good clarity amongst the light mahoghony body.
The aroma gives very little away other than certain maltiness (which is a good thing for the style) but it fails to live up to much.
Tastes are relatively authentic for a ""mild type"" (not sure why we need to designate milds as dark and pale, every mild I EVER drank in England for years was always dark, but there you go). Light metallic malt and a subtle hoppy dry factor in the finish. Easy drinking and moreish, I enjoyed this.
All in all a decent beer, but too carbonated and too thin for the style. Doesn't help that it is bottled either - ho hum. Outside of that a decent stab at the style, and to be honest we see so few good examples of these types of beers (lower ABV and subtle hop malt combos) that I am just happy to see almost any version. I have to be happy with what I can get, and not to be too fussy."

I've had this a few times before, time to review it now. Declares itself as ""3/4 of a pint of Summer Ale"" on the label.
If you take Hocus Pocus for what it is - a light drinking summer time brew - then you'll enjoy it more.
A pale but golden pour with a decent head and some surpisingly good lace. Looks better that I remember it in the past!
Nose and tastes have some very light citrus and lemon grass notes, with a hint white pepper and a touch of orange. Everything is very subtle, which is perfect for the type of beer we are dealing with here, and as such is complements the light touch.
Easy drinking, a nice ABV and a perfect summer gulper, tasty and good value - what else can you ask for?"

Dark brown pour with a mocha colored head that fades to a thin film but looks nice. 
Extremely malty nose, but it seems to come with a fluffy, aged and musty character which is not very attractive. I don't think that this is a very old bottle, but it tastes a bit old.
Refreshing with a dry, hoppy bitterish finish. Tastes reflect that old flavor too.
Decent, and apart from the odd, ""old"" taste."

This has been getting some mixed reviews at the pub so I thought I'd better road test it myself to be sure.
Orange, hazed body with a moderate head and not a great deal of lace. Looks unspectacular and NOTHING like a ""Belgian Dark Ale"". I would be looking for a bigger head and some much darker, browns and blacks to get to that particular classic look. This looks more Tripel like.
Fruity ester meets the nose and the early palate. Nice if unspectaular. Residual sweetness comes through and the finish is dryish. Some Belgian yeast and candy character but not much. 
Pretty ordinary all the way around and the kicker is the mouthfeel. VERY thin for the (claimed) style, and really rather thin in general. One and done here, and although this is not a bad beer to actually sit down and drink a few of (the BS menu lists it as a ""sessionable Belgian""), the mouthfeel really lets it down and it is a VERY poor example of a Belgian Dark. Drink it not thinking of a Belgian Dark and you'll be happier."

Review #1600.
Well, interesting one this. 11.2 fl oz bottle that is a very attractive sight with its pyramid shape and some interesting raised lettering a the base of the bottle - I'm gonna keep this one, its decorative. ABC-3513 on the cap.
$1.19 from Michael's in Marietta, GA, USA as a single. I was pretty sure this was a very old bottle when I bought it, so I took a chance - why not? A closer inspection of the bottle at home shows that it has the (odd) numbers 1-31, I-XII and 02-04 on the label that COULD be notched but it ISN'T! This makes this at LEAST 3.75 years old and I would bet much older than even that. I also see that the last review was in 2005. I wouldn't mind betting that this beer is no longer imported and distributed in the US. Just a guess, but I would not be surprised.
Anyway, on to the beer itself. Pours with a cloudy orange color and no head or lace. A bit murky.
Nose is malty and musty.
Taste is basically as expected with a malt base and very little bitterness. The problem is that there is a VERY earthy note - a bit like soil! I suspect this is simply a function of age. Some oxidation, but not to the extent that I think it is nasty, but that may be because I like malty beers. Either way it's not great.
Glad I tried it, but I didn't finish the bottle since I was concerned about the age. Drain pour for 75% of the bottle."

Nose revela strong malts and a litte alcohol. 
Tastes have the malty character, but also a sweet, liquor-like taste. A bit like sherry. Finishes with a dry bitterness which is odd rather than tasty. The dry character lingers a while.
Not really very nice, and the 12oz bottle is a bit of a struggle to be honest. Not much to endear this to me at all."

This is a review of the bottle; corked & caged, 2.008 on the cork, L08081B 10:23 on the bottom right hand corner of the front label.
A professed, Biere de Table.
I bought this thinking that I was on very safe ground from the point of view that a Saison/Framhouse produced by Dupont was unlikely to produce any surpises, and would be good quality. Those assumptions are basically very sound.
Poured into the Duvel tulip we get a lightly clouded orange pour with a big initial head that fades to give some nice lace and a sotty, creamy head. Nose has the requisite white pepper and light fruit esters.
Tastes are exactly as expected with champagne like dry character with light, organic funk and tart acidity. Nothing to complex here, it ""just does what it says on the bottle"". Mouthfeel is pretty light, and at a REALLY REFRESHING (from all kinds of perspectives) 3.5% ABV this is a very nice beer that I could LITERALLY drink in 20oz pints!

Lots of dark brown/red highlights throughout the brew with a bone white half-inch head. Looks solid. Not much lace, by the head is nicely sustained.
All the usual attributes; strong smoke scent that reminds me of meat, nice body but the main thing I take away from this sampling is the strong sweetness that comes through as the beer warms. I've never noticed it that much before but here it was very prominent.
Simply a beer that has to be consumed with food, the meatier the better. I paired this with orange pork chops, grilled lemon asparagus and rice - delicious. Very satisfying beer."

A lighter than expected golden pour with a nose that reflects the oak. Robert said that chips were used rather than the barrel but to me it's difficult to detect such a nuance.
A light smokiness in the nose and taste which is probably a combination of the oak and my inability to pik it up correctly. Some of us at the tasting also got some estery pear notes. i got a touch of pineapple too. However, to me any fruit and Belgian charcter is swamped a bit by the oak and I lose the subtle edge of the brew.
Pretty drinkable, but doesn't mesh all that well for me."

A combination of four hop varities goes into the beer, which although not necessarily easy to detect as individual notes, do lend a certain complexity to the brew. A light citrus note is first followed by some deeper soapy like notes. The malt cuts across the whole beer to leave a satisfying mouthfeel. Quite ""meaty"".



I get a certain clean, sharpness about this beer that i wasn't expecting - it seems fresh, always a good sign.

An interesting concept behind this beer - this is taken from the Saharp's web site;
""The Eden Project was set up in Cornwall to promote the understanding and responsible management of the vital relationship between plants, people and resources leading to a sustainable future for all.
At Sharp's we are committed to making great beer with the least possible impact on our environment. Eden Pure Ale was developed in conjunction with the Eden Project in order to prove that a natural beer brewed in conscience with the environment can taste so much better than the multitude of mass produced factory beers which these days crowd our public bars and supermarket shelves.""
Another classic English Pale with hop and malt subtlety blended to perfection. A biscuit, roastiness that reminds me of digestives gives the beer a detectable acidity in the mouth. There is a distinct fruit character (peach and pineapple) that combine with the lighter hop notes to give balance.
Very drinkable, if somewhat simple beer."

Thanks go out to Robert for providing these samples at a recent Brick Store tasting. 220z bottle.
I've got to say right off the bat, that a beer at nearly 13% ABV kind of puts me off right from the beginning. Coupled with such a potentially enormous style, you are treading a very precarious line betweeen disaster and success. Sometime this can be pulled off, but it is a high risk, low reward strategy IMO.
Anyway on to the beer. Jet black pour as far as I could see, with a slight red/brown highlight at the very edge of the brew. Head fades to nothing fairly quickly to leave a spotty film with only a touch of lace. Looks just about as expected for the style and the ABV. Good legs.
Alcohol is upfront in the note, but there is a lack of chocolate or roasted notes until you get to the taste. This beer seems to me as though all of the elements of such a beer are there, but they are combined in a somewhat unbalanced and jumbled way. Even as far as to say that each mouthful seems different to the next. Now, sometimes you can call that complexity, but in this instance the roasty dark elements that compete with the oat/cereal backbone seems to create and uncomfortable marriage. The size of the ABV doesn't exactly help.
I dunno, this just fails to come together well for me. I get the impression that al lthe ingredients are there, but the sum of the parts falls short."

Shared this one with Dave at The Brick Store.
Poured out as a unattractive, dirty brown turbid body with no lace and virtually no head either (as expected considering the ABV). Looks VERY ordinary, I would even go as far as to say disappointing. Another unattractive note is the fact that there seems to be degree of brown color, almost like pond water when sediment has fallen via gravity. However, I didn't see and sediment. Odd and not good looking at all.
Aroma is as expected with alcohol taking the lead ahead of the stron malt base.
An extremely edgy beer with a lack of subtlety and smoothness. I think this beer is caught between the American and English Style which makes it rather awkward. It has all the sweetness that you would expect from the English version, but none of the smoothness. American style big hop notes still prevail which meld poorly with the sugary malts, for frankly, a bit of a mess!
After the Wee Heavy, this is the second Alesmith beer that I have been sorely disappointed by after some really great experiences. I guess they have been relegated to a ""hit and miss"" brewery with me. Shame."

Dark orange almost amber pour into the Duvel tulip. Head is scant and short lived, to leave a few bubbles and some spotty head on the surface of the beer. No lace on the glass.
Definitely a ""triple-like"" beer but ends up coming up a little short, and you can tell this is not an authentic, Belgian Tripel. Body lacks something, and although the nose and taste both have some peppery, ester like sweetness about them, in the end the whole seems less than the sum of the parts! A bit too raw in places. A hint of peach in the taste, but a ""stronger than I would like for the style"", raw alcoholic like burn.
OK, but not thrilling, nevertheless not bad value and a semi-drinkable beer. I've had worse, but then again I've had a hell of a lot better, especially within the style."

WOW! I've had this one for a long time in the back of the DBF and I had very low expectations for it on a number of levels. Firstly I've had a couple of FC brews before and I was less than impressed. Secondly I've had this for quite a while and I thought that time would not have been all that kind to it. Thirdly, although I like the doppelbock style, there is a fine line between good and poor. So, I open this up not expecting much, and then...
...a nice chestnut pour with good clarity. Head is average and short lived and there is not much lace to speak of. 
Aroma is amazing. Partly because I DIDN'T realze this was a smoked beer! I thought it was just a regular Doppelbock. Mild smoke followed by a delicious smoked bacon note. Fantastically the bacon is deliciously replicated in the taste! I've had plenty of Rauchbiers before, and the ham note is often there, but this is really different - a REAL bacon character, and it's great!
Finishes smooth and pleasing with a little sweetness. I simply cannot believe this is 10.00% - the alcohol is absolutely NOWHERE to be seen, and it drinks like a beer less than half its ABV.

Pours with a surprising golden clarity almost a macro lager like effect. HUGE, billowing, magnificently huge, sustained head that leaves amazing lace - looks super!
Smells and drinks more like a high alcohol euro lager - STRANGE! Slightly slick mouthfeel as well that comes with the mild burn. Sweet with a high alcohol feel about the whole thing.

Nose is a little musty with some fruit esters and some wood. 
Tastes are predominantly dry and I get some manure and a little cork-like bitterness. It tastes a little ""old"" - a bit floury, fluffly and lacking the usual funk edge that Fantome usually provides. I also get some red wine and tea like tanins.
This seems to lack a certain clean edge. Maybe its the age of the bottle, but I though that this would cope quite well. This is certainly not a REALLY old bottle so I am a little confused.
Not my favorite Fantome by a long way, and to be hnoest I was a little disappointed. It lacked sharpness and was a little dull. I don't *think* that the bottle was that old, but the beer seems a touch jaded."

Very sweet and the sugary notes carry this. I quite like it, and the fact that the sweetness sort of overcomes the alcohol is a good thing for me. Having said this you are simply not going to be able to drink much of this one.

Well it is what it is - it's a pretty good example of an AMERICAN Brown Ale which basically means that it is way too hoppy and as a result loses all the charm of the original style which is all about smoothness and malt rather than bitterness. Nevertheless, a good example of that particular style.
Slightly murky mid-brown pour which is also not to my liking. I much prefer a darker brown and more clarity. However, the head and lace are good which somewhat makes up for the lack of pleasure in the appearance of the body.
Aroma ia more balanced than the taste with a good dose of malt and hoppy notes coming through.
The taste however, gets a little ""in your face"" (at least for a Brown Ale) and delivers (for me) too great a roasted note. On the roof of the mouth it really feels like I've been chewing some roasted dark grains - not what I want upfront in my Brown's. Finish has a residual hop bitterness that lingers - again, not huge, but still too much for me to really indulge and enjoy this beer to its fullest. there is a bit of a burned feel about the roastiness too, like unpleasant ash/smoke.
I dunno, I suppose it stacks up pretty well within the style, but its difficult for me to score this any higher since it just doesn't do it for me."

12oz single from Total Wine in Kennesaw, GA, USA.
Notched as being bottled in the first week in Feb. Reasonable to assume that this is Feb '08 (since Total Wine seems to have a decent turnover), but you never know!
Good, standard color for the style (pleasing) with copper and dark orange hues, and a good initial head, however, any lasting head and lacing are disappointing thus reducing the ultimate potential of the appearance score.
Sweet toffee based malts hit the nose and a similar candyish taste replicates itself in the taste. Smooth and easy drinking. Aftertaste is light and satifying.
All in all a decent stab at the ESB style with sensible ABV. Those attributes are unusual enough in many American versions of the style so I am turned on to this beer. Outside of that it is solid rather than spectacular, but I have to take what I can get whe I am so far from home. Above average for a Stateside version; average from a wider perspective."

Minor Saaz-like finish and a clean metallic aftertaste. Refreshing, and a better quality product than many similar attempts but still lacks a REALLY distinctive Saaz bite/edge for me. 
I dunno, I've been drinking this on and off for years (in England we used to get the chunky 500mL? bottles) but for me it's never really felt as clean as many Pilseners. Still a little disappointing to me and still hovers uncomfortably close to its namesake!

Unfortunately that's where the good stuff ends. Slight, carbonated clove in the nose but this is followed by a largely watery body. Thin and lacks presence. Lacks any kind of significant tastes, very disappointing. Not good.

Head and lace are reserved, but look high quality and dense. There is a really creamy, mocha look to the head. Body has some of the typical murkiness about it, but there seems to be a darker note than in many others of the style. Carbonation and mouthfeel are perfect, and led to a really creamy, velvet like experience. Perfect.
Nose has a very sweet banana and a touch of clove and something else in the oregano/herbal nature.
Extremely rich, if standard tastes. I always feel that the Weizens can be let down by a watery feel to the taste or the mouthfeel but this beer comes through on both. As it warms on my deck in July Atlanta heat, the banana notes increase, but so does the sweetness.

I got lucky I guess, but being in Green's as often as I am sometimes makes me lucky! Anyway, paper wrapped, 750 mL bottle, capped and corked. Brickstoredave told me a very limited amount made it to GA so I feel privileged.
Disappointing lack of ""pop"" on opening. I wasn't expecting a HUGE bang, but given that this is categorized as a BPA rather than a Lambic I though that there would be a little more carbonation. Poured in to the Duvel tulip the body is a dark orange, murky concoction with a very scant head and no lace. Much more Lambic in the look than BPA - make of that what you will.
Nose has the requisite cider (West Country, England) funk. This gets better as the temperature increases. Finally gets to a delicious, mildly acidic, dry scrumpy feel. This is as close to an EXACT replica of a genuine Devonshire or Somerset farmhouse cider that I can remember in a beer. It's also reminiscent of the dry Calvados based drinks of Northern France.
Drinkability is astonishing for me. 750 mL gone in NO time, and the ABV is not SO punishing that it hurts.

Not sure if this should be categorized as a simple Belgian Pale, but I am not as preturbed as I sometimes am with style considerations and the BA database, since this has ""Flemish"", ""Brettanomyces"", ""Saccharomyces"" and ""Wild Ale"" on the label. That means that I am NOT surprised when the beer turns out to have plenty of funk, a sour edge and lots of rustic, cider character! Lots of warning!
I'm learning a lot with these brews, and the largest single factor seems to be that the second glass with a little higher temperature and in the wake of the first glass, is always better, smoother and more to my liking.
Nose has a citrus, band aid phenol edge. Tastes are more dry cider like, and the body is very pleasing and warm. Clean finish with a touch of lemon.
Quite acidic in the end, with a bittering effect that is not especially forgiving. This strikes me as a funk beer for the more experienced raher than a newcomer. Nice."

Updated Review 11/10

12 oz bottle, directly from Scotland sent by James from the brewery.
Batch 71 BB: 27-04-11
Immediately it is plain to see that the color is TOTALLY different from two years ago. So much so, that it would be pretty much impossible to identify the two experiences as the same beer. 
This one is hazed and muddy brown in color. with a frothy head initially that fades quite quickly. Body lacks clarity and is not especially attractive.
As before, the main characteristivcs of the nose and tastes are soapy ones. Again, not a problem if held in balance, but the soap here now seems overtly aggressive with a harsh drying bitterness and an over-the-top alcohol presence.
Finish is alcohol warming, dry and excessively bitter but without the charm of a West Coast hop-bomb.
In reality this is just not a very god beer. It wasn't in 2008 and it isn't in 2010. It seems brash and loud without the balls to back up it's mouth.
Pass.

Excited to try this new entry to the GA market. $12.99 from Arbor Place Beverage, Douglasville, GA, USA for the 660 mL bottle. Batch 002, best before 07/07/09.
Pour is an alarming yellow, macro lager like color with a fast fading head and minimal lace. Looks slightly over carbonated and I don't really care for the overall look. I want more orange color in my IPA's, coupled with a better head. Not a good start.
Nose has a mild soapiness which is not necessarily bad, but lacks much hop presence for me - that can't be good in a DIPA.
As others have noted, buttery diacetyl flavors are there and this is followed by a soapy, uninspired bitterness. Odd, non-clean aftertaste. It's not terrible, and it grows on you a bit, but this is slightly aspirin like beer and it is definitely a work in progress. Lots of work to do here.
Even if this were a really good DIPA, it would be HORRIBLE (and I mean HORRIBLE) value, unfortunately this is also not a very good beer to boot. Approach with EXTREME caution and it has put me off trying the other three ($12.99 & $9.99) offerings of the Punk, Scotch Aged and the Stout."

Poured into the Terrapin 22oz snifter. Head was disappointing, but based on the ABV not all that surprising. No lace. Quite frankly the color and look of the beer is very disappointing too. A nasty, turbid brown body which on closer inspection looks really watery. 
Nose is all sweet malts with quite a whiff of alcohol. The alcohol, although strong is also pretty smooth.
Tastes replicate the nose pretty much (which is a good thing). Slightly more edgy with the alcohol in the taste, and it finishes with a noticeable bitterness. A touch of smoke, but it's barely there. In the aftertaste there is a definite liquor note as well - a slight Scotch element. In its favor, as it warms it gets better. Not a very subtle interpretation.
To be honest all in all I was rather let down by this. One of my favorite American brewers and one of my favorite styles, but the whole thing seemed out of whack to me. It seemed out of style and just too pumped up and not smooth enough, not subtle enough, not rounded enough and not malty enough. I dunno...."

Light bitterness in the initial tastes and it leads with an Oatmeal character too. Bitterness lingers and there is a touch in the aftertaste, but paradoxically I would not describe this beer as ""bitter"". Obviously the hops are cutting in. Alcohol is well hidden.

In his words, ""Dark copper in color with a subtle roasted flavor. This beer is a low hopped, very drinkable beer with a wonderful flavor profile"".



Simple copper colored body with a nice head and lace. Good clarity, nice looking and in line with the style. Very light and easy drinking with the balance being the key. Strong malts are present to balance the subtle hops, and the beer goes down REAL easy. A little nutty, and some light burned (roasted malt) notes too, albeit in the far, far back.

Difficult to argue with the description of the beer as being light, this brew is a very nice example of the style, but simply something I am not especially interested in. It DOES have the redeeming characteristics of a beer in the style, namely really good head and great lace, great clarity and a simple, refreshing clean edge that lacks skunk. That combination made it popular with my wife who can only drink beers like this one.



My guess is that this beer forms part of the line-up strictly for commercial purposes, and for that who can blame them. Actually a good example of the style, but of course not really a beer that will inspire most BA's - a necessary evil for the enterprise!"

I would describe the color as much more yellow than copper. A real butterscotch hue in the glass, with almost a ""cask like"" head. For those of you unfamiliar, that means really just some soapy bubbles on top of the beer rather than a tightly formed, compact and dense ""white"" head. Bubbles leave some pleasing lace.



No doubt that we have a bitter, solid IPA here. Drinks well below the advertised 7.1% and acts as a real thirst quencher that satisfies right off the bat. Grassy notes upfront that settle to a more rounded bitter palate in the back. Slight metal sits pleasingly in the finish and aftertaste.

It pours a light, honey colored body and a big head in the Tucher 500 mL glass. A lot lighter than the other version. After an initial big frothy head it fades to give a much less dense, wispy type of head. Some very fine lace.
Smell has pretty much a sweet, light alcohol and not a great deal else.
Tastes are a simple, sweet grapefruit juice. Not much else in terms of complexity or characer to me. Perhaps the mere hint of pineapple. There is a slight dry, hoppy finish but it's hardly prevelant. This beer is MUCH more drinkable than the other version. It seems lighter, less cloying and just more drinkable and approachable."

I saw this maybe two summers ago on Hilton Head Island on draft at Mellow Mushroom. At the time I avoided it thinking that it was just another nasty, macro product.

""Born On"" (WHAT BULLSHIT) May 2nd 2008, this is a positively ANCIENT A-B product! Over carbonated and a lager like body that has an odd metallic nose. VERY clean, almost surgical. A little phenolic note in the nose, that doesn't quite get to the antiseptic BandAid level, but is noticeable. Large head that fades in an instant.
Maximum burps and bloating with a honey like taste. Smooth in the mouth at the same time as being almost with out body.

Alarming pale color on the pour and an equally alarming, large head that is VERY, VERY wispy and lacks any kind of density. Honey colored body eventually settles out as the bottle conditioning yeast hits the color. Some lace after the head subsides BUT it is VERY light.
Nose has a little of everything that you would expect, PLUS some white pepper. Plenty of candy sugar and yeast along with the alcohol.
Dry and clean in the taste. Alcohol dryness dominates the Belgian notes, but that's OK. Short finish with a dash of malt, this beer is pretty lightweight all around.
I like it as an example of the style, but the truth of the matter is that is lacks much depth or mouthfeel. Better beers out there in this category."

Opens with a healthy 'pop' and poured into the Duvel tulip. Mid orange body sits underneath a towering head with wonderful lace. Darker than many Tripels but with the lacing this looks VERY good. Lacing is some of the best I have seen in some time.
Nose has a big, musty Belgian candy note. VERY malty in the aroma too with lots of Brown sugar.
The beer drinks much less sweet than the nose would suggest. Some yeasty fruits up front and a slight bitterness in the background. It finishes with a hoppy, almost tobacco note. Lacks the typical sweetness associated with many Tripels. Alcohol is nowhere to be seen, but there are plenty of burned malts in there too. 
Interesting beer in as much as it is not as sweet or as alcoholic as many Tripels and has a distinct bitterness (citrus rind or mixed peel; maybe even a little grapefruit). I'm not sure how old this bottle is (I suspect that it has some age on it) but it has been kind and the beer drinks very well."

Tripel like nose but with less fruit and more emphasis on the alcohol. However, this is not as aggressive in the taste as either the look or the nose would suggest. This is an unusual Tripel in terms of it's richness - I like it a lot.

It's worth while saying at the outset that I am not especially keen on the Bourbon aged brews. I often find that the Bourbon simply takes over the brew, and in the case of, say, a RIS there is no need to add an extra dimension to an already huge combo of characteristics.
Anyway, this is MUCH more subtle than many other Bourbon aged beers that i ahve had in the past. The nose has some vanilla notes, and it drinks a little sweeter rather than roasty and dark. I think the style is a better vehicle for the Bourbon; here it seems to mesh nicely with the richness of the malts AND (for me) it has the added advantage of taking the smoke elements OUT. 
I think this is very drinkable, ESPECIALLY for the style (I gave the score for drinkability in the context of the style). Tasty and not overpowering, BUT having said that 10oz is just about enough for me."

Significantly orange body with a limited amount of head and lace. It actually appeared that the glassware was seriously affecting the head and lace; the Allagash stemmed glass produced some nice attributes while other glasses did not do the appearance justice. Clouded body beneath the varying amounts of head.
Plenty of Brett in the nose, but it never really cuts in until the finish where it was really quite acidic. Pretty much what you would expect from the style but lacked a touch of body and presence for me. Light yeast character also. The variation in appearance summed up the whole beer for me - just a bit hit & miss, as if it were not ""quite"" there.
Most people drinking this thought that it was fantastic. I really enjoyed it, but I still felt it was a little on the edgy side of things. Maybe it needed a tad more time, or perhaps the journey had not been kind to the brew, but either way it felt like it was a really good beer that was performing just below its best.

Interesting nose and taste. This drinks like a non-sweet Tripel with plenty of alcohol character and lots of spicy white pepper. What seems missing from the mix is a residual sweetness and a smoothness that I would expect from a Belgian Pale. Very large, grapefruit citrus taste too.
Lacks a bit in the body, and if I am going to drink a Belgian Pale I want a little more sweetness and a little more depth. I like the pepper character but against the backdrop of a relatively thin body it loses its charm rather quickly.

Frankly this is a bit odd. It pours more like a macro lager, and lacks a cloudy appearance. It must be filtered?
Nose is a sweetish, corny skunk and this is followed by the taste. It's not really offensive, but if this was a blind tasting I would never have put this down as a wheat. Essentially this looks, tastes and drinks much like a macro lager. Disappointing in two respects; firstly simply from the point of view of the beer not being very good, but secondly in terms of the advertised style.

Nose reveals VERY little other than a touch of skunk. Not offensive, rather simply bland and nothing there.
Highish carbonation greets the tongue on the first taste. After that it's followed by dry, mildly bitter macro corn tastes. Watery in the aftertaste and mouthfeel.

Gold clarity on the pour, with a head that is certainly NOT large, but does leave a small film on the surface. No lace. Not bad looking, just the standard macro look.
A touch of citrus in the nose, but not much.
Mouthfeel is woefully poor; watery even.
Well, if this is a Pils, I'm a Dutchman. This is essentially a macro lager with hardly any flavor other than a watery bitterness. If there is honey in there it's largely absent in the taste. A annoying prickly carbonation finishes the package.

A healthy dose of citrus/West coast pine in the nose and I think, ""look out, this is going to be just too big!"" Luckily the big nose is a little more tempered in the taste, and it seems to drink more like a diluted West Coast hopbomb. As the label suggests, there is a certain ""green"" feel to the hops.
This one skirts the edge of easy drinkability though, because the although the hops ARE controlled, they are still astringent and without a great deeal of malt support.

Nice malt based bitter with a simple light hop profile lurking underneath and in the finish. A few summer, soft fruits in there too to pull the beer together. A little more tannin/tea character (which has a drying effect) for my taste, but a decent stab at the style.

The nose on the beer is as expected with a full blown blast of hops but it seems controlled. Similarly, in the taste we have a big hop presence but the whole thing is tempered with malt and the beer is memorable as sweet rather than a hop bomb - surprising. Malts dominate for me!

This is one sweet brew and with the combination of the hops I get an enormous mouthful of coconut. Quite a sickly sweet beer to me, and this is coming from someone that loves sweet brews.

Interesting brew this one from all kinds of angles. 
The BA database has this as Wee Heavy/Scotch, and the color (a deep mahogany), and the slightly sweet, mildly smoked tastes suggest this is true. However, it seems like the yeast strain and sweet sugars still manage to add the classic, Allagash Belgian influence.
The next thing I'm interested in is the oaking. Generally I'm not to keen on Oak Aged stuff, but this seems VERY mild in that department, and it has the effect of creating a warmth in the alcohol and a pleasing bitterness at the end of the drink. Nice.
Interesting. Finishes with a touch more smoke and a warming alcoholic rush and the residual sugar is left. Tasty.

Light freshly mown grass in the nose, and a distinct yest note that carries over to the taste. Although not a ""hoppy"" beer by ANY stretch of the imagination, this does deliver both a citrus tang AND a mildly bitter aftertaste. Nice, light and simple balance.
Also VERY refreshing. Obviously has ""Summer quencher"" written all over it, and the beer pulls off a nice combo of taste and lightness.

This is NOT a Belgian Strong Dark by any stretch of the imagination. It's much more like a Belgian Strong Pale with some Champagne character coming through too. Full and creamy in the mouth, the carbonation is perfectly understated. A light acidity accompanies the finish and the alcohol, although present, is really nowhere to be seen in terms of its power. very light tart notes, but very reserved.
VERY subtle, light and delicate, another one of those beers that you could happily substitute for wine or a mild aperitif or toasting option.
I think this is classy - Allagash rarely misses, and this is another fine example of a beer that is streets ahead in terms of class."

I had a quick look at the reviews on BA before drinking this, and I understand where people are coming from. HOWEVER, I really think that I have HUGE advantage over many of those BA's who have reviewed the beer so far. I was born in Devon, England, and was raised for a large part of my life in the county and close to the Somerset border. As a result, I KNOW, REAL West Country Scrumpy (Cider) VERY well - I was raised on it. This is a beer that is based in the those great, farmhouse, rustic traditions. Coming from that point of view gives me a perspective that few will have.
Pour is a slighted hazed, light orange body with a fizzy, bubbly head that fades to almost nothing except a wispy presence on the surface of the brew.
The beer is classically smelly. A combo of acid, apples, manure, farmhouse funk and slightly putrid water - FANTASTIC!
Very light and refreshing it has all of the requisite elements for a rustic beverage. A sweet and sour combo. Many white wine characteristics. Light grape notes (with the associated acidity), and plenty of warmth. Dry, champagne like finish. Tasty.
Delicious beer, but you need some perspective to appreciate this. Think GENUINE Scrumpy and you'll be halfway there."

Some freshly cut grass, as well as some sweet, alcohol, skunky Euro Lager notes in the initial taste. A tiny, tiny hint of Saaz in the finish but it is minimal.
Drinks well. Refreshing and pretty smooth, a half decent hot weather beer for drinking in the right context. Not much more.

Happened to share the first pint of this with pghlee when it was tapped at the Brick Store for the first time. I *think* that this is similar (if not the same) to a version that was tasted at the Atlanta Cask tasting in Jan '08; I didn't care for it much then, nor do I care for it now.
The pour is an orange brown, with a lot of chill haze and murkiness. Head is not relevant and the lace is scant.
In a nutshell there is just WAY too much going on here. To be frank I think it is a bit clumsy. When you are starting with a beer like Rye Squared, you are already at the VERY edge of sensible limits of complexity and taste, and adding an oak/age/barrel character just takes this beer out of the zone for me. It gets overly complicated and its drinkability drops off dramatically.
There are too many competing elements here. I get mouthfuls of smoke, wood, hops, malt and alcohol, and combination is not one that is complex in a good way, rather it becomes a cluttered mess - not organized or controlled.
IMO, a poor choice of beer to complicate further, and ""kow-towing"" to the latest trend in oak is simply a BAD idea with this beer. Also VERY exensive kegs for what it is. Poor value."

Nose is an extraordinary yeast, funky bomb - not unpleasant but very obvious.

Big, herbal nose with some interesting notes of freshly cut green leaves - quite odd! Mint? Very, very, very mild smoke??
Large alcohol presence, but this is VERY smooth. Dark fruits abound, but there is a big white pepper entity in there too. Also a certain red wine, tannin dryness as well; it comes together very nicely. Complex to the point of having some Quad like character. As it warms there is more licorice.
As far as the drinkability goes, the alcohol IS there but it doesn't seem to manifest itself in an aggressive way. Drinks as a ""big"" beer, but at the same time below the 10.00%.
Very creamy in the mouth.
I detect a slight movement away from the typical Unibroue Big Belgian to a more distinctive, almost unique beer. They do a nice job here and it is unusual but successful."

Golden pour with a light and fluffy head. Large bubbles form meaning the head is not a dense one. Light wispy lace is attractive. Looks really nice in 500mL Harpoon IPA glass.
Bold hop nose lets you know immediately what you are dealing with - a SOLID American IPA. Slightly medicinal aroma of largish hops.
Tastes are well balanced with a good malt backbone supporting the obvious hop presence. Some fruits in there, and this drinks with an interesting combination of very bold dry character and light fruit. Highly drinkable, light and refreshing, BUT I'm never gonna have more than a couple of these for two reasons;
1. It's (and so often the American style of IPA in general) just too aggressive for me to enjoy anywhere near a sixer, and
2. I would really LOVE a similar beer coming in at half the ABV.
Whilst I DO like this beer, it seems to be a quintessential example of the weakness in American craft brewing in general. It would STILL be a great beer (and infinitely more drinkable) with half the hops and half the alcohol. Shame it isn't."

2. The one other review seems to resemble what I drank.
3. It was listed at the bar as ""Brewer Ale"".
Anyway, a very dark brown pour with a pretty lively, frothy head. The head eventually settles down to yield some nice, spotty and creamy lace. The beer was served in a frozen glass (what the HELL is wrong with these people), so the nose was tricky to pick up, but it was hop-based (perhaps a hint of citrus pine a la Rogue).
Tastes have some malt upfront with a hint of chocolate powder, but as per usual with Rogue the hops take over and kill the ending. It cuts across the ending and leaves a very severe bitterness.
I dunno, the whole Rogue experience on draft seems to end up this way for me way too often. It seems harsh and metallic in the end, and is ultimately rather disappointing."

Nice looking reddish/brown pour, but served waay too cold. When it warmed a little it revealed a solid malt backbone that really was pretty sweet. I really enjoyed the deep malts.

The usual funk character, but a very earthy note to this. The organic nature seems to make this beer feel a little rough; almost like a homebrewed Saison. Here the emphasis is definitely on the Farmhouse side of things. The earthy taste was almost literal, with a hint of soil being in the taste! Strange.

Nose has the requisite pine and grapefruit notes. 
Tastes are typical for the style. Grapefruit is there, but the bitterness is really quite harsh. Nothing subtle about this, and ultimately I think it is way too big for its britches. Slow burn on the way down completes the unbalanced package. It's just VERY difficult to make a beer this ENORMOUS in terms of hops and ABV, and still end up with something that is drinkable. For me, this fails somewhat.
Dry, burning finish. Unbalanced and rough.

Poured into the new, 22oz(!) Terrapin snifter, this looks great. A great choice to christen the new glass. Lovely honey colored body with a thin film of fine bubbled head on the surface. Some lace, but I don't think that the glass (as attractive and nice as it is) retains it very well.
Nose has some yeast, alcohol and plenty of green fruits. Promises much.
The taste delivers on the nose. Delicious, edgy vinous quality that brings together a great white pepper, wine, Belgian Pale, yeast, alcohol combo with a very small hint of Belgian sugar. Dry, alcohol based finish cuts is as well, but not before the fruitiness and alcohol have combined to deliver a sweet and sour tart and boozy mixture that hits the spot beautifully.
Mouthfeel is the weakest part of this beer with a little prickly carbonation that could be toned down a little. Doesn't really subtract from the beer, but it was a touch sharp.

All the classic Wit notes with an extra dimension of mild tart apples. The extra ""funk"" associated with this beer tends to make it lean toward a less well defined Wit and perhaps even over into Saison categories. It reminds me very much of a mild (yet funky) Devonshire Cider. Definitely barnyard notes in the nose and the taste.

Tastes are interesting with a yeasty background with some citrus notes. In fact, if I had to sum this up I would call it VERY reminiscent of a typical British Lager Shandy.

EXTREMELY surprised to be only the second person reviewing this. Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA. Standard (for this release) 24oz bottle - good for sharing!
Light orange body with good clarity. A HUGE, light and fluffy head sits atop the beer. Lace is good. Looks inviting.
Carbonation seems low, which makes the beer feel a little flat. Mouthfeel is simply soft, but the lack of carbonation makes you feel that it is a bit more syrupy, and perhaps even a little higher ABV.
Fresh West Coast nose. Tastes are prety much as expected. A metallic, bitter-sweet brew that is subtle enough to be an enjoyable, but still maintains the whole ""Fresh Hop"", ""West Coast"" feel. Perhaps the only criticism is a lack of crispness.
Pretty much exactly as I was expecting, a nice beer, but I suspect this will be the only one I drink."

Not a big fan of Abita in general, so coupled with the style, I did not have high hopes. The beer turned out to be marginally more drinkable than expected, but not really anything I could imagine buying ever again.
Poured from the 12oz stubbie (with the annoying label that has dates on it but that were NOT notched) into the Tucher Weizen 0.5L glass.
Very light yellow pour, with some mild chill haze and some ill-defined head and lace.
Mild strawberry ice-cream nose - that is to say there is a milkshake creaminess to it. Very little of this is reflected in the taste, so the beer seems just like a sweet, APA or wheat beer.
Very little character, but I guess that's the whole point. Easy drinking on a hot day, but there is a very fine line between this and a thousand other macro/light lagers. Not for me."
"Bison Brewing Co.","Reunion '08","","","Rye Beer","6.5%","bottle","3.85","3","4","4","3","4","5/6/08","22oz bomber from Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA - $4.99 (I think). Delighted to have the opportunity to help a good cause, not so much bothered what the beer is like.
Amber body - good clarity; thin looking with a lack of significant head and lace. Thin in the mouth too. Some rye in the taste, but I have had one or two rye beers that have MUCH greater rye character (Terrapin). I like the somewhat muted rye notes.
Sweetish, sugary toffee/caramel nose. A bit popcorn like.
Despite the fact that the body is a little on the thin side, it still has a refreshing lightness about it, and I drank the 22oz pretty quickly. Carbonation seems low, and there is some caramel sweetness in the finish.
Don't know what the ABV is, but it drinks in a sessionable fashion, going down very easily.
Tasty and a simple belnd of hop bitterness against solid malts - it's OK."

Poured into the Tucher 0.5L Weizen glass. New entry to the GA market for this brewery. I've had a couple of others in the past, but this one is new to me.
Cloudy lemon color - standard. Small head and some ringed lace. Clean, medicinal nose - again standard.
As is the danger with the style, one can easily fail to pull it off with authority, and this tends to leave a slightly fizzy, watery and uninteresting beer - this falls into that category for me.
Bland is the word that springs to mind. Summer sipping, but it's one and done for me."

Not available in GA, this one came from a recent jaunt up the east coast. 8JW dot-matrixed in the usual Anchor manner. 
Good, mahogany color from a noisy pour. Rich body, head and lace - very nice looking. Head is very nicely retained with good lace.
Tastes lack a bit of sweetness that I was looking for, and have an almost tea-like taste. Good mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden. Some bitterness in the finish, but not much. Tannin lingers and coats the mouth a bit. Red ember highlights are very bright.
I guess that the beer lacks a little something. I think it is a combination of sweetness and alcohol that I was looking for more of to keep this in style. On reflection maybe I was expecting more of a Doppelbock (which may not be at all fair), either way I was left wanting a bit more."

The third time I've had this - first time review.
Pour is as black as night with (after the fizzing carbonation of the initial pour) no head or lace to speak of. Dead looking.
Thinnish body with an acidic nature to the beer. Definitely more fruit beer than stout, and I don't really care for this much. Sour is the main theme, without much of a fruit note. Finish is tart sweetness.
A very tiny lactose character in the finish.
All in all, a disappointment to me."

Pour is a simple, dark urine colored body underneath a head that is gone very quickly to reveal virtually no lace. Small bubbles of carbonation do persist, but they do not seem to contribute to the head in any way.
Grassy and grainy nose, with a similar taste along with some extra sweetness. Some herbal hop notes, but the whole package is pretty muted. The macro-lager sweetness is a little cloying in the finish. Nothing too offensive, but in no way is this a very good representative beer for the style. I could drink a couple I suppose, but after that I would be annoyed that the beer is not a good reflection of a style that I like, and the slightly, sickly sweet notes might start getting to me.
Strikes me as a macro attempt at a far more complicated style. If I want a BdG, then I want a real one - not a pretender."

Golden macro pour with a large white head. Very little lace and no retention to speak of.
Aroma is that of a traditional British, lager-shandy. The lime notes are not pronounced as lime, but more of as a British lemonade. Sweet, carbonated Sprite/R Whites like rather than citrusy.
Nose and aroma are not aggressive by any means. Slight citrus/lemon taste, but obviously nothing much else. Refeshing, but obviously zero character - I could have been drinking a seltzer water.
No harm, no foul. Probably my first and last, but I could suck a few of these back at the pool, on the beach or after mowing the lawn, but it would have to be free and MIGHTY hot.
Outside of that, not much to report. Fairly clean and non-offensive, but just about as far from beer for a BA that one can magine. A beverage for children and women."

Synthetic cork which I am simply not a big fan of - takes away the authenticity a little for me. Opens with an encouraging pop.
Poured into the Duvel tulip, this is much darker than I was expecting. Nice, dark metallic copper hue with a great head and nice lace. Head is well maintained, and is creamy/dreamy - thick. Unusual color for the style.
Nose has light citrus funk, against some more aggreesive vinegar character. The nose worries me a bit, since it seems rather acidic. Luckily, the taste does not have too much acid.
Tastes are a little more muted than the nose would suggest. Simple, light acidic funk - with a darker edge (to match the color) than I would expect for the style. As it warms there is a slightly increased caramel note.
Even some Rodenbach type notes!
A nice brew, but I must admit I prefer a ""lighter"" looking and tasting Saison. This is a touch too tangy for me."

Orange/Red pour with very little sustainable head or lace. Hazy appearance.
Slightly acidic, apple based taste. Quite a high carbonation and not really in tune with the style as listed on BA.
Light fruits but not much there. Slight floral nature. Some mild tangy, sour character.
I'm really not sure what this is, or what it supposed to be. Either way it's largely forgettable for me."

It lists the ABV as 11.0% which leads me to believe that it *could* possibly be the Grande Reserva version, but there is NO mention of this on the label, so I'm runnign with the Reserva.
Dark rust colored pour that is still in the glass - no head or lace to speak of. Consistet with the ABV.
Nose has pleny of sweet alcohol. Replicated up front with sweet alcohol, but the finish s dry and bitter. A certain mustiness to the beer that is not especially attractive. Warmth lingers in the aftertaste. Tastes ""old"", and not in a good way. Some rum notes, with dark sugar. Reminds me of a Jamaican drink. A little light in the mouth.
This didn't do a great deal for me."

Crawford was kind enough to give me a bottle of this (along with the Quinte55ence original and a couple of Cloud 9's). I shared these with the boys at the Brick Store.
Pour is identical to the Quinte55ence - no surprise there, and equally unsurprising is the aroma which gives the smoky notes from the barrel.
I need to put a disclaimer right up front here, I am just not that interested in Barrel aged beers. They really aren't to my liking very much.
Much prefer the Quinte55ence it its original form, as the added liquor character seems to confuse the beer for me. Coupled with the original edginess and Barleywine character of the Quinte55ence, this becomes a bit too much for me to handle.
Certainly still a quality brew, and if you are interested in this ""type"" of creation I am sure you'll be delighted - just not really my cup of tea."

Rust colored, hazy pour with nice head, and very impressive, sticky lace. Aroma is sweeter than expected, and does not reveal as much hop character as I expected.
Smooth in the mouth, and not too hoppy or edgy at all. Quite a bit of sweetened grapefruit, but also a decent drop of aspirin/herbal content. In that respect, a little reminiscent of a more balanced Masala Mama. Quite sweet in the finish.
Definitely a beer that has been highly influenced by West Coast/American DIPA's, but still maintains a certain character of its own. Not something that I would be really keen to drink much of again, but nevertheless tasty as a one-off."

Golden macro-lager colored body underneath a decent head. Head is short-lived but leaves impressive lace. Not bad looking at all.
Aroma is a malty grain, but not very strong, distinguished or especially interesting.
Tastes are simple. Balanced malts with some hop character and some sweetness. A creaminess to the mouthfeel, and also in the actual taste itself. Distinct and satisfying finish and aftertaste - tangy, yet smooth. An undercurrent of white grapes. I wasn't expecting much but this was tastier than I was anticipating and I enjoyed it very much.
Excellent value for money!"

Pour reveals an amber colored body, but it lacks the depth of color that I was expecting. Head is also a little thin and fades quickly with only the tiniest wisp of lace. Some large bubbles of carbonation.
Nose has the obvious malts, but lacks much definition.
Tastes are a little confused for me. Yes there is certainly the rich malty notes that one would expect (and there are some nice biscuit malt notes in the aftertaste), but the alcohol seems oddly present and not melded well into the body of the beer. Actually I'd go as far as to say close to being a bit solvent like. The effect is an acidic, sharp finish that seems out of character with the style. It's certainly sweet (which of course is fine and what I was expecting), but again the beer fails to come together completely for me.
Usually one of my favorite styles, and I had high hopes for this beer, but sadly it didn't come together very well for me. I'd try it again, but this didn't really hit the spot for me."

On-tap at Cypress Pint & Plate Atlanta, GA, USA. 0.25L serving in the correct glassware. No head (bad pour by the bar), but plenty of carbonation.
Settles down to give a rather unique tripel experience in as much as we continue to get that soapy, hoppy finish which is unusual for the style.
Better exprience from the bottle I feel.

It might be worth saying that I am a huge fan of Chimay in general, but this was a bit a let down.
I drank this on-tap at The Flying Saucer in Memphis. Served in a genuine Chimay glass, it was simply too cold for me! I am positive that the temperature seriously reduced the aromas that I would normally expect with this beer. Some banana undertones, but that was about it. It also had a somewhat ""soapy"" or ""disinfectant"" quality about it.
Color and appearance was as expected. The least favorite of the Chimay's for me."

I had one bottle around Christmas time and decided to pop this one open to see how it had changed. I don't mind my IPA's with a little age on them, and coupled with the Belgian aspect, I felt this would be a good candidate to put a few months on - luckily, I was right.
750 mL corked & caged affair that opens with a big ""pop"". Poured into the Val-Dieu chalice it sits as a rust colored body. The head disappears very quickly to leave no lace, and only the slightest of fine film on the surface of the brew.
Mouthfeel is quite carbonated,bordering on fizzy. The nose reveals simple Belgian character but little of the hops that the style suggests.
The taste too is mainly Belgian candy and yeasts, with only a hint of the hop bitterness in the end. Obviously this may be because of the age on this beer, but I still like it. Finish is dry and simple. A little orange peel in the finish as well.
Refreshing and tasty, and easy beer to drink."

(09.05.10 dot-matrixed on cap).
Much the same as below, but in this bottle the alcohol seems to be much more prominent in both the initial taste and the finish. Alcohol in this bottle seems a little more harsh and less smooth. Some more licorice and slight bitterness. Still incredibly complex.

Poured into the Westmalle Chalice from the 330 mL, unlabeled bottle with a ridged ""collar"" 3/4 of the way down the neck with ""TRAPPISTEN BIER"" molded on it. 05.04.08 stamped on the cap.
Dark brown murky body with a few yeast floaties. Very thin tan head with minimal lacing from the very fine bubbles that form. Outside of the small surface head there is no sign of carbonation. Frankly not exceptional looking in any way.
Aromas develop slowly as the beer warms. Light fruit alcohol and buttered toast hit me at first.
Initially this has all the characteristics of a big, Belgian dark. Lots of fruit and alcohol up front, but this cuts away quickly to leave a dry sherry like experience. The aftertaste is very complex with a mild grapefruit bitterness to go with a mouth filling Amontillado and marzipan taste. Perhaps a mild touch of aniseed too. I have to admit that this is a beer with an amazing taste.
Finishes very warming with some whisky like liquor heat. Alcohol is very evident in the finish too.
The best beer in the world? Well, given that that moniker is all about opinions and differing tastes I would definitely say it's *ONE* of the best I have ever drunk, and I can completely understand why it stands where it stands in many, knowledgeable folks opinions, but at the same time, some will enjoy this more than others. Not great value for money to say the least!
Many thanks to akorsak for the trade."

*Obviously this is still a draught version, but Crawford bottled some of this beer in corked & caged 750's. 
Pour is a dark brown almost black body with very little sustainable head. I thought it was rather porter like it its appearance. 
Very nice nose with plenty of dark fruit and perhaps even a touch of smoke. This beer has Belgian Quad character, but to me it was MUCH more edgy and less smooth. Some American Barleywine character thrown in with the Belgian sugar and yeast notes, to create some serious alcohol and hoppy overtones.
Mouthfeel was still - very, very little carbonation to speak of.
Interesting brew that for me needs some age. I thought it was a tad raw at this stage, and I would love to see this in 12 months time."

There we picked up the ""empty"" cask and poured the last couple of pints from it by tipping it up and massaging the last drops of beer from the vessel into the glasses. I thought I had missed this opportunity, but not so. VERY grateful and appreciative. Thanks Dave.
Black pour with a few reddish highlights - not much. Head is not really a factor here, but some bubbly brown foam from the aggression of the pour.
Well, having tried the 16 last weekend and not liking it a great deal, I was worried about this. Again, frankly I didn't care for this much either. Liquor notes and bitterness was too high for my liking, but once AGAIN (as in the 12), I found the smoke and peat notes to be too much, and this was a factor that I did NOT enjoy. I MUCH prefer the standard Engine Oil beers that have not been aged in the Whisky barrels.
Some others that tried it, raved about it. Having failed to be impressed by both the 16 and the 30, I guess that this is just not a beer for me. I wonder if I will ever get around to the 12, and if the experience will be any different?
Delighted to have tried it, but...eeeehhh.... completely undwhelmed. I happen to have the chance to drink the Meantime Scotch Ale the day after, and I thouhgt it was an INFINITELY better product in the similar style/mould.
I say, let Old Ales BE Old Ales, and keep the sweetness and avoid the Barrels."

OK, lots of confusion here.
I bought the original bottle in NC when at the time, we were getting both the IPA and the Porter from Meantime in GA. I though that perhaps it would eventually get to GA, but it never did.
Fast forward to March 2011 and I find that the beer is noted as 'retired' in the BA db, but again it is on sale in the Carolina's (this time SC) and I see that this is obviously part of a 'new' release as this is bottle 574 out of 2050 with a vintage date of 27th of October 2009. Not sure what's going on here. Anyway, back to the beer.
Pour is a pretty, dark copper body with a few floaties.
Once again huge malt notes in the notes and tastes and real depth and richness to the whole beer.
Some light acidity to the beer with a rich aftertaste and note of EXTREMELY light smoke.
Still tasty, still moreish and still a super beer.
Original scores remain unchanged.

750 mL corked & caged, champagne style bottle from Sam's Blue Light in Durham, NC. Heavy, dimple-bottomed bottle, dark olive green glass, I love these bottles - great presentation.
Dark brown pour, great head and lace and super garnet highlights.
Aroma is AMAZING - a super malt BOMB.
Rich, malty monster that is smooth in the extreme, has a touch of subtle, subtle liquor and finishes with class. Immensely smooth in the mouth.
For me, a GREAT beer; the best I have had in sometime, and a quintessential example of the style. Drinkability is a ""5"", and the beer is just moreish and delicious."

Like most, I have very little experience with Wheatwines, and the only one I recall from the reccent past being Harpoon/The Bros. Triticus - this seemed very different.
A very still, viscous orange body with no head or lace but some nice alcohol legs in the wine tradition.
Big solvent alcohol in the nose. The taste smooths out a little, but not a great deal.
Has the alcohol edge that you might expect from an American Barleywine, but this is sweeter and certainly significantly less hoppy.

Taste reveals much more of the sweet nut character than the nose. Medium body that keeps this in sessionable country. 
Close to a really good sessionable beer (it could be argued that the ABV is still a little high), but it has all the other desirable factors for a session brew.
Finishes smooth and sweet, and stil satisfies.
A solid example of the style and a nice beer. Good job."

Typical golden, hazed orange body, light head with some lace in the Val Dieu Goblet. Fine bubbles, vibrant colors. Looks nice.
Light Belgian candy in the nose with some yeast. Silky in the mouth with light, fine bubbles. Plenty of sweetness in a typical triple fashion, but also with a really distinct hoppy finish. Reminiscent of a Houbblon Chouffe. Plenty of dry, mild sweetened grapefruit in the finish. Tangy.

WOW - classy! Mid-orange pour with a super high, dense, bone-white head.
Nose has a mild grapefruit which is reflected in the taste.
It is isn't until the ending that you get the Brett/Funk/Saison/Farmhouse notes. All melds together to give a deep, satisfying experience in the glass. Some bitterness in the finish but it comes together beautifully to give a memorable beer.
Smooth on the palate, I would characterize this in the mould of a Belgian IPA, but having some Biere de Garde and Saison character too - an interesting beer.
We were sitting around talking about comparisons and obviously Houblon Chouffe and De Ranke XX came to mind. HOWEVER, when we poured a Chouffe to actually DO the comparison, it seemed weak and watery, ESPECIALLY in the nose - frankly it was VERY light sitting against this.

750 mL with the usual wax-dipped neck presentation.
Having had the Belgian Red (cherry) I thought that I knew what to expect, and this replicated the style of the cherry and did not disappoint. Straight from the outset I enjoyed this MUCH more.
A dark crimson (almost blood like pour) even with a small head. It's raspberries all the way, both in the taste and the nose. Sweet certainly, but balanced. The raspberry taste is REAL, with it feeling a lot like just the raspberry seeds have been pulverized and bottled - the essence of the fruit.
This seems to have a balance, an effervescence and a fresh edge that the cherry lacks. MUCH lighter with some characteristics of a Lindemanns Framboise and a Kasteel Rouge.
I don't think that everyone will enjoy this, but at 4.00% ABV this is RIDICULOUSLY drinkable. The sweetness is tempered, and I enjoyed this much more than the cherry."

A little alcohol in the nose and some hints of whisky, but it's not big. Nice aroma, it promises much and the nose is the best part of this beer for me.
A malty beer as expected for the style, but for me there is WAY too much peat and smoke. I understand that this beer is from Scotland, but for me this is out of character and style. The Old Ale style needs to much richer and sweeter - this finishes dry.
Frankly, a bit disappointing. Makes me reluctant to go for the others. I didn't care for this a great deal."

Poured into the Val-Dieu chalice. Pour is a very nice, slightly cloudy classic orange body. Head is not very well retained, but is attractive, and very fluffy. Lace was impressive. It loks attractive and inviting.
Some mild pepper in the taste, but also some edgy, solvent like alcohol. Warming on the way down too. The slightly watery texture adds to the solvent nature. Definitely some lemony, acidic and sour notes, and these take away from the sweetness that I would expect for the style. A dry finish.
A bit odd for me - even from one mouthful to another this seems authentic on one hand, and then a little harsh and alcohol laden on the other. A work in progress in my book."

Nothing special to look at - in fact it has the appearance of a macro lager. In that respect it does not reflect the style very well. I'm looking for a big, fluffy head in my Saison's, some nice lace and some cloudiness in the body. Given the style it preports to be, I was disappointed.
Some funk in the nose but not much. Rather than funk being the predominant taste, I get a sweet Belgin fruit blend. It's not unpleasant but it seems too light for the style and it lacks both character and body.
I'm not saying that this isn't a decent beer to drink - it was quite refreshing and somewhat tasty, but it totally lacks any character, depth, body or presence, ESPECIALLLY when you consider the style. Summer quaffer, perhaps to be used in place of a Pils for someone who prefers something a little sweeter and less bitter/hoppy. It's character as a genuine Saison is limited IMO."

Nice looking pour with a high, mocha colored head, but relatively poor retention and not much lace. Very good dark brown body with some sharp, garnet highlights. When the head has gone the beer takes on the exact appearance of a coke; including the mild streams of carbonation.
Typical for the style, but I detect more lactose notes. In fact, I might even go as far as to ssay that if this were a blind tasting I could have mistaken this for a milk or sweet stout rather than an oatmeal. Alcohol comes through really strong for the style - almost solvent like - and this sits badly with the chocolatey, milkiness of the brew.
Lightish mouthfeel, and finishes with some burned notes, a touch of charcoal and again, a noticeable degree of ethanol.
This was an older bottle, but not old enough to suspect it had turned, but perhaps this would be better fresh. I'd probably give it another chance."

Reddish brown pour, but lacks a real depth of dark color that I might expect from the style. Head and lace are a little disappointing.
Sweet, malty alcohol in the nose.
The alcohol certainly comes through in the taste. Not overpoweringly, but nonetheless present. Obviously plenty of sweetness. Quite light in the mouth for the style - sometimes you can get an deep, full, syrupy mouthfeel but this seems lighter.
One and done here I think, somewhat average beer and example of the style."

Four months on, and this beer still captures the nutty, malt character of the style nicely. Rich, great brown color and depth and some super red highlights.

Original Review 04/08

One of my favorite styles.
22 oz bottle, $4.99 State Line Liquors. Deep, deep dark brown pour (from a distance, almost black) with a few garnet highlights but even these are on the dark side. Nice head, some lace.
Massive milk chocolate, malt nose. 
Creamy milk chocolate tastes mingle with some light colored, buttered toast with honey. Sweeeet. Nutty finish, but VERY light and subtle.
The mouthfeel is a touch odd - it seems to have a little too much prickly carbonation for the style.
Wow! Tastiest brown ale for some time, slightly let down by the mouthfeel for me. Nevertheless, exceptionally tasty and moreish. Shame I only bought two bottles of this on my travels."

Mid-brown body with plenty of very sticky lace above the minimalist head. Nose gives away a sugary sweet concoction laced with some alcohol and a light hop presence.
I am generally wary of American Barleywines since I think far too many of them have way too much hop presence for their own good. The nose kind of confirmed my fears, but the tastes did NOT come crashing in as I was expecting. The tea seemed to add a sweet subtleness to the beer that was very welcome.
Some herbal notes are inevitiable, and these calm the hops to give more drinkable, less harsh brew than one might expect.
Sweetness (like an English Barleywine) seems to win out for me. Tasty brew that is different and very enjoyable."

Relatively new to the market, Matt has produced a very simple, subtle beer again. I don't know what his intention was, but essentially apart from the rather high ABV, he has produced an English version of the style rather than an American one. More subtlety than in your face - I love it! I WISH more brewers would do this.
Mid-brown pour, not really especially attractive and probably its weakest point.
Hops take a back seat to some biscuit malts, and the beer is mellow rather than abrasive and harsh. Feels light, and drinks WAY below the advertised ABV for me.
Delicious and from a taste point of view this is very ""sessionable"" without being a session beer - I guess ultimately you would pay the price with the ABV. It's a shame that I will probably not get to try many of Mayflower's products, at least not fresh and near the source."

Orange-bronze, hazed pour with small amounts of carbonation, head and lace (obviously!)
Subtle hop notes make up the nose and the taste. Nothing overpowering here, and this is a welcome change of pace from double-this and triple-that. Certainly some light floral notes, but I get some really strong English hop influence here. I have NO idea which hops are actually used in this beer, but it seems low-key and built for flavor rather than effect - again pleasing.
Tasty brew indeed, and at 6.5% it feels good and goes down easy.
My first Sixpoint offering and if this is the standard then I am going to seek out plenty more. Super stuff."

Excellent clarity on the pour reveals a super, light orange body with a nice light head, and some sticky lace. Looks clean and inviting.
Big, citrus pine in the nose. No holds barred in the aroma, and it begins to make me wonder if this is going to be one of those hop bombs that rips the roof of your mouth off. Luckily it doesn't.
The taste is much sweeter and less abrasive than the nose would suggest. Pretty good balance. A west coast influence from the hop profile, but plenty of tasty, sweet malts balance it out nicely. In fact, in a blind taste I might even put this in a Pils category. Nice sweetness in the finish that is balanced by a hop based aftertaste - sharp and clean.
Although my review above seems quite good, paradoxically this was a tad disappointing. It just didn't do much for me, and given it was a special release, I thought it could have done more."

Pour reveals plenty of head and lace, and a lovely golden, orange clear body. Lace is very good, carbonation is high. Very mild citrus hop nose, which is repeated in the initial taste. After that the beer becomes a simple, dry and clean Pale Ale. Lovely, tasty malts but with a tart edge. Aftertaste comes through with a delicious dry and mild bitterness. It lingers a little.
VERY quenching, and tasty. ABV is attractive to me.
I would imagine that a lot of people will miss the point of this beer, but if you can appreciate a simple, well made beer then this is one you must try - very nice, delighted to have tried it."

Surprisingly I had never seen this beer or this brewer with beers on tap in the USA, so I was delighted and excited to try it. It was served in the brewery's own glassware - an impressive, bowl-like goblet that really looked great! Allowed me to take some lovely, large, satisfying gulps that swirled around inside the mouth. Beer feels bigger than it really is.
Very solid example of the style. Lovely pale yellow color with nice head and some lace. Simple peppery, sweet notes and Belgian candy and yeast. Pretty much exactly what you would expect from the style with the exception of the body that was a little light for my tastes. Drinks under the advertised 8.00% ABV.
I really enjoyed this, especuially the presentation and the taste - good stuff!"

What a great beer. Poured into a large snifter, the beer comes out almost completely black. Nice full head, lace and general appearance. Looks robust.
I get plenty of licorice and aniseed. Tasty mild funk too (to give a nod to the Saison moniker), but it is muted and light in terms of presence.
Good body, and a beer that feels authentic to me. Malty.
I really enjoyed this very much, and the idea of mixing the darker malt base into this style really pulls off a tasty and intriguing beer. A dark Saison - I like it!"

Pretty standard, deep copper colored pour with a bit of a disappointing head and very little lace. Even some agitation fails to produce much life - carbonation seems a little low. Nice clarity in the body though.
Nose seems pretty neutral. Maybe some caramel notes.
Taste has a simple balance of malts and hops, but lacks a lot of depth. Might be totally my imagination, but there seems to be a little smoky peat in there too. Simple caramel based finish.
I dunno, it seems as though this beer lacks depth. I was hoping for a richer, deeper experience here, and with a sensible ABV I thought that I would like this more. Richness is the thing that is missing for me. It seems like it has potential but just misses the boat. I'd like to see this one get developed a bit more, but I guess this will be one and done and never seen again. Could do better I guess would be my summary."

Poured into the Ommegang chaice this sits nicely in the glass with a creamy, dense head (if somewhat small). Not much lace. Lovely dark brown body, almost black. Nose reveals some sweet alcohol, but the oak is muted.
Velvety smooth in the mouth - really creamy. 
Soft, sweet Belgian candy notes with plenty of liquor soaked, dark fruits. Tasty.

22 oz bottle from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA. $5.99 (I think) for the bottle. Poured into an oversize wine glass that I picked up in Raleigh, NC a couple of weeks ago.
Pour is a vivid mustard, clouded body that sits underneath a really high, rocky head. Lace is excellent. Good looking.
Nose reveals very little other than a sweet, alcohol laden honey note.
This is still a really hot beer, especially when you consider the style. It continues to drink every inch of the advertised ABV, and that's a little problem for me.

22 oz bottle from State Line Liquors. $4.99.
Two separate pours into the Tucher Weizen 0.5L glass. The first pour does not allow the sediment to reach the glass, and as a result it is a orangey, golden clear pour, a little like a macro lager or malt liquor. Good head but disappointing lace. The second half of the pour is much cloudier, with a distinct burnt ornage color as the sediment makes it into the glass from the bottle. Again the head and lace are not great.
Nose and tastes match pretty well. Sharp, lemony notes but with quite a lot of balanced sweetness. A little citrus zest tartness (especially in the aftertaste) but not as much as I was expecting. Unfortunaely the beer has a slight, syrupy, malt liquor like alcohol feel about it - not the greatest attribute at the best of times, but in this style it sits a little odd. Minor yeast notes, but these are more muted than I would like for the style.
I think that the ABV is a little on the high side for the style, and that has an impact for me.
An interesting brew, that is close, but seems to miss the mark slightly for me."

Classic look, with a deep garnet hue and a good half-inch of solid, foamy head. Head disappeared quite quickly, some lace.
Very solid offering from a reliable brewer that consistently hits the spot in terms of styles and drinkable beers. Nice hop/malt balance, but the most important attribute for a Red is the finish. This hit the spot with a characteristic, dry note and left a subtle and pleasing aftertaste. Lots of (partial) session potential I would think, but without knowing the actual ABV I would still be a little wary.

I like the text that is written on the rear label - much simplier that a lot of Stone nonsense (for example), but still an interesting message. 5/5 for presentation.
Poured into the Ommegang chalice. Not a great color, again that murky brown Dubbel like appearance that I dislike so much, but it has more carbonation than I was expecting. Thin, creamy and spotty head forms on the surface of the beer, with little or no lace - that's OK, wasn't expecting very much.
An interesting spice-like pepper note cuts across the expected dark fruit and sweetness. This is one of the more edgy quads that I have tasted which takes us into Belgian Strong Dark territory with a distinct peppery quality.
Standard dark fruit base, with large hints of alcohol and a touch of residual bitterness as well - maybe some red-grape skins? The usual plums and raisins are there. The alcohol becomes more pronounced on warming, even leading to a mild burn.
For me the drinkability went down somewhat as the bottle was consumed.
In summary this is an impressive brew that makes me want to get into more Lost Abbey beers. Thanks to Rustydiamond for allowing me to piggyback on a South Bay order."

Flanders Oud Bruin? Not to me. This appeared to be an overly sweet Dubbel. Typical, dirty brown Dubbel body with some floaties. The overwhelming sensation and taste here was sweet, sweet, bubblegum. The bubblegum aroma and taste were extraordinarily strong to the point of being distracting. No hint of any sour notes that one might expect in a more typical example of the (alledged) style. Hubba-Bubba aged??
I dunno, this seems like a bit of an work in progress to me. I'm really not sure what it is trying to be. If it's trying to be an Oud Bruin then it fails; if it is trying to be a Belgian Dubbel then it is too sweet with much too much Belgian sugar influence.
There's quite a lot of Belgian yeast influence, but the bubblegum is way too strong to make me want another one of these."

Murky, light brown pour into the US pint glass. Lack of clarity, and a turbid brown color rather than the orange end of the spectrum. Decent head, but lace fades quickly. Average looking.
Sweetened grapefruit in the nose.
Very sweet. Plenty of unrefined sugar upfront and this does not fade and as a result it tends to leave a sugar deposit in the mouth, on the tongue and the teeth. Some bitterness in the finish (the hops are obviously there), but the whole thing is shrouded in a sweet cloak.
Lacks definition for me - a dull beer, and for someone that generally likes sweet things I found it all a bit taxing. Slick in the mouth - lacks a clean edge.
Pricey as well as average, so not one I'll visit again soon."

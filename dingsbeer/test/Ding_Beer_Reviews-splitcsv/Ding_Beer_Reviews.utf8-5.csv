I wasn't expecting much from this beer, since my experience with Shiner has been average at best but its often worth persisting with this kind of brewer. Nice loud pour with a pretty lively head and some nice lacing. Head has some persistence.



Dark brown body with some rust/orange colored highlights. Some sweet caramel notes in the nose, but surprisingly you don't get a lot of this in the taste. I suppose I shouldn't really be surprised because even though this looks like a sweet, malty brown ale, its actually a Schwarzbier. 



Dry finish, a little acidic and sharp and clean. Not a lot of malt here and only very mild bitterness. Not bad."

Pretty unusual beer.



First off, it pours and smells like a pretty standard, English Pale Ale, bottle-conditioned offering that we get in the USA. One difference, there is a cloudy, honey colored appearance that is a little different. Lots of simple, sweet biscuit malts (as expected) in the nose and the taste, but then things change fairly rapidly. Creamy head.



There IS a spice element, but not in the way one would expect from a standard, malty Winter Warmer. It is a bit more funky than one expects - a sort of English ale meets Saison! MUCH more herbal than your typical Christmas spiced beer (cinnamon, nutmeg, all spice etc. are all absent) and it finishes pretty dry.



A rather interesting and nice change of pace beer. I enjoyed it and was pleasantly surprised."

Excellent black color and plenty of (if somewhat thinnish lacing), but this is where the really good quality ends. Wierd, herbal notes in the aroma, somewhat floral and soapy. Hops way TOO prominent for the style.



This is an odd beer to me, at least in terms of the style. A thin body, very high hop bitterness for the style, edgy and not at all smooth. Soapy bitterness and all in all a pretty underwhelming beer.



I wasn't over-excited about this beer on-tap, and in the bottle I am even less impressed. Sorry Sweetwater, I love you guys putting out some of these seasonal offerings but this is a miss. Keep trying!"

Black body with some ruby red highlights. Some spotty lace on the surface of the beer. Licorice in the nose. Tasty beer but not really stout like. Good malts, but not much bitterness. A little thin in the mouth for the style I think, and in many ways this isn't really very ""stout like"". Quite sweet with a little alcohol in the background of the finish.

Looks nice with a high and dense head and a very dark brown pour. Sweetness is definitely there with the honey influence (in the aroma too) but this drinks like a high quality brown ale. Smooth, drinkable and whilst not exactly rich, still smooth and drinkable.
Easy drinking and simple, but certainly sweet. Not everyone would like this but I enjoy the sweeter malt brews. Not a great deal of Porter character here for me, but good nonetheless. Another solid beer from BBC."

Good carbonation (lots of fine bubbles) and some small head; a little lacing. Good deep brown color with a slight tawny-red hue. A little alcohol in the nose. Obviously malty, obvious sweetness but an alcohol taste that is bigger than the ABV would suggest. A tiny alcohol bitterness in the cleanish finish.



Not a bad offering, and the kind of beer I could enjoy a few of in a session. Decent, simple, Doppelbock, a good intro to a different style for BI's and as such some crossover potential."

Poured into a small goblet the beer has a very Dubbel like appearance. Very cloudy and typical brown, I'm afraid that is not at all attractive.



Aroma has a LOT of herbal content. It reminded me a lot of the Cinzano Bianco dry vermouth that was so popular in the 1970's. That drink has a number of herbs and spices listed as artemesia, gentian root, clove, and cinnamon mixed with notes of agrumes. 



The beer has a very distinct herbal quality that is very clear. A clean edge to the herbs make this an easy drinker. Pleny of the usual Fantome funk. 



This will not appeal to eveyone by any stretch of the imagination, in fact I'm not at all sure that it would ALWAYS appeal to me! It's a mood beer in my book and is definitely going to be hit and miss on many fronts."

Golden pour. Looks OK. small head, disperses instantly. Average beyond average in all respects. Strikes me as low quality and cheap. Mild malts finishing with mild bitterness. The kind of beer that is unoffensive and must fit the AB mold perfectly. Bland as bland can be. Generic APA in a style that already struggles for identity this should be called BLAH beer by Redhook.

Michael was kind enough to get this from ""the unadvertised stash"" that he often has.
Bottled in August of 2005. In a unusually pleasing scenario, the notch system for dating the bottle had been replaced by what appeared to be a Sharpie type mark - certainly very clear, I suppose it has the potential to be ""false""? It cost $16 + change.
Having drunk some Oskar Blues RIS (the Ten Fidy wih the cherries) last night, I was inspired to continue on with the ""BIG stout"" theme this evening.
Poured in to the Brasserie de Abbaye des Rocs chalice (also purchased on the same trip to Brawley's) it is jet black in body and virtually opaque. Smallish head, but nice espresso type thin, fine carbonated lace and a thin film on the surface of the beer. Great looker.
Very big coffee in the nose, but even bigger in the taste. This is nothing if not coffee based. If you don't like coffee based beers and stouts, this is most definitely NOT for you. There really isn't much subtlety here. Dark roasted beans with a mild smoke finish completes the coffee immersion experience. I was a little surprised at the lack of alcohol presence too.
For such a huge beer the mouthfeel was surprisingly small. It would be a stretch to say ""thin"", but it wasn't as I expected.
A bit of a struggle to get through 22 oz on my own, definitely would have been better off sharing this one. Drinkability is hampered a bit by the overwhelming coffee experience which simply doesn't let up, AND has nothing else to off-set or complement it. I wouldn't mind trying this again, but it would have to be; (a) on-tap, (b) fresh and (c) a little cheaper for me to be tempted again."

Aroma has LOTS of sweet malts and caramel notes. Some sweet, sweet liquor in there too.
This is a pretty sweet beer with some smoke character. There are some real sherry like notes in there too, and if you were looking for a description I think I would call this an Old Ale with a little extra hop bitterness. Sherry and warming liquor notes too, but VERY sleek and smooth. No edge to this beer and in that respect a little short on Porter character.

Let me start by saying a couple of things. I didn't think I would like this a great deal and at the same time, one of these is plenty in one sitting to make sure that you still enjoy it.



Jet black viscous pour with a large, dark brown mocha head. This is THICK, but considering everything, very drinkable. To be honest I didn't notice the cherries a great deal. Either in the nose (this is a weak spot for me when reviewing) or the taste. I think that is a good thing since it means the beer has not been infused with artiicial sweetness or fruit, and the whole experience is more authentic.



Outside of that all that you would expect from a RIS. Big alcohol, big burned malts, some mild cocoa and coating mouthfeel. Delicious sipper than actually got consumed a little too quickly."

Lots of sweet caramel malts in the taste with a little toffee, and the alcohol is low key - until the finish, when there is a blast of EtOH again. Hops are surprisingly muted for me, with the alcohol replacing the bitterness that I was expecting.



I quite like this beer, although it is definitely a poor man's American Strong, a Stone Arrogant bastard wannbee. Having said that, it's OK and worth a try."

HIGHLY carbonated. Enormous initial head that fades very quickly to virtually nothing. Head and lacing is thin and light. Butterscotch clouded yellow. Alcoholic pepper in the nose. Aroma is consistent with the style. 



Mouthfeel is the missing component here. Too thin for the style and a little too sour. It lacks the depth and the funk of many similar beers, and in that respect is mildly disappointing.



Main problem here is the cost and therefore the value for money. With cheaper Fantome available in GA, it's a non-starter."

Nice looking clear amber pour with an impressive pillowy, ivory head, a spotty film on the surface and some good lacing. Nice looking.



Some mild spice in the aroma, but much more pronounced in the taste. Dark holiday spice with some fruits, all supported by a solid malt backbone. Good bitterness in the finish. Smooth and sweet.

Hazy, lemon colored pour with (as others have mentioned in their reviews) perhaps a light tinge or hint of green - an odd color indeed. Creamy, piled high head with some pretty nice lacing. Appearance is nice.



Aroma - clean hops, quite astrigent.



As is typical for an American IPA, this is very hoppy to the point of being soap like. Very pronounced bitterness and drying, lingering aftertaste.

Aromas are all sweet, bready notes - very nice. Very tasty with toffee and molasses sweetness. Some banana richness almost like a dark Hefe! Very rich, and the mouthfeel is the most surprising aspect of this beer. Exceptional for the style.

Dirty dishwater (Dubbel) appearance, scant carbonation and a decent head, but it fades quickly (ABV?). A little lacing but not much. Plenty of sinus clearing acid in the aroma and the repetition is there in the taste. Highly acidic rather than sour and to me very little other character. Remind me very much of a rough scrumpy West Country cider without the charm.

Delighted to find this at Mac's, Atlanta, GA, USA as a single (mixed sixer $6.99), I presume from a broken down mixed Winter 12 pack. I've had quite a number of the Saranac beers, and although generally serviceable, I was not expecting much. This was a nice surprise. I may be a little biased since this (Brown Ale) is one of my favorite styles.



Nice pour with classic color and a really impressive head and lacing. Very good looking. Quite citrusy in the nose. A surpise to start with, but when you analyze it, if this is an AMERICAN brown then I shouldn't be that shocked!



Deinitely an American version of the Brown Ale style. More bitterness than I would like, but it works well within the confines of the style. The mouthfeel is good and the finish allows the bitterness to fade to show more of the typical malt sweetness that one would expect from the original English style.



All in all a good beer, very much in the style, BUT the American version of a brown is less appealing than the English version for me. I am looking for sweetness and malt in my Brown Ales and this obviously falls short; having said that one of the better Saranac offerings."

The beer is an ester-filled, malty and sweet bomb. It finishes quite acidic and with a mild hoppy, dry presence. 



Very smooth, quite drinkable, but where it fits into the traditional ""Altbier"" scheme is difficult for me to tell. I often wonder if the Organic moniker has anything to do with the apparently odd interpretation of the styles that Pinkus seems to apply."

I'm an increasing fan of these ""Imperial"" (or whatever you want to call them) Big Pilsners. I like the way the higher alcohol seems to sit in the syrupy, thick body and they really create a large drinking experience. This was a good example.



Really golden color to the body, plenty of head and lacing and a really sugary, syrupy mouthfeel evident. Sweetness up front, nice alcohol too. The higher alcohol Pils certainly detract from the typical, dry, hoppy clean Pils edge, but I enjoy the different interpretation. Nice stuff.

64 oz of pure hoppy pine! Light amber/orange color with absolute clarity with some light carbonation. A few bubbles but not much. Huge frothy head with some significant lacing. The lace is really sticky (that's one of the crucial things I look for in an American IPA), a nice looker.
The aroma is one that is difficult to ignore. Huge resinous pine, organic hay, grass, hops and other sweet meadow like fragrances fill the nose. Obviously the tastes reflect all of this. Sweetness is there for a fleeting few seconds, but this is followed by a massive kick of those resinous pine notes. A very small touch of mild aspirin, but it is tempered and fits in perfectly with the rest of the American DIPA experience. Some drying bitterness in the finish. Good hoppy burps induced (another GREAT sign!)
It's ALL, West Coast American DIPA, so you get all the good and the bad that comes with that, but it is typically resinous and high level in the hop department. Don't expect to enjoy this if you are looking for an English style IPA or if you do not like West Coast hops - simple, take heed."

Corked and caged 750 mL bottle. The pour is interesting in as much as the color is very much that of a Belgian Dark rather than a Belgian Pale. However, once you get into the taste, the Pale moniker begins to ring more true than the appearance would suggest. Quite dry and light, mild spice and mild candy, and although nice, there is a lack of depth of fruit flavors in keeping with a Belgian Pale. Surprisingly light, drinkable and even mildly hoppy (or at least at little bitter).



Quite highly carbonated with a good, fine bubbled head, but it fits very nicely with the rest of the beer.



I really enjoyed this beer and was somewhat surprised at how light and simple it was. A ""Belgian Light"" if you like!"

I get some buttery hops in the nose, and the beer is light and drinkable. A simple, hop based medium bodied beer with very little surprise in store. This beer drinks exactly as one would expect for the style and some may call it boring, but the power of this beer is in the ease of drinking and the subtlety.

Wonderful aroma breaks free from the bottle. Dark fruits, sweetness and yeast overtones envelop the beer and this is coupled with a little lingering alcohol. The alcohol IS well hidden (after all it is a 10% beer), but it still finishes with a bit of a kick and some drying, harsh bitterness.



This is not quite a smooth as others in the style, it is really a grown up Belgian Strong Dark - it's a bit too edgy, a bit too strong and a bit too bitter. Nice, but a Belgian for the experienced rather than the novice."

Bread like aroma, with a little yeast character.



Tastes are wheat based and almost Hefe like. In fact if I was drinking this blind, the combination of the appearance, the head, the lace and taste would have me thinking it was a Hefe rather than a Pils.



Perhaps a little less traditional Pils being unfiltered, but drinkable still the same. This beer has a creamy mouthfeel and is less sharp and clean than a regular Pils (and obviously lacks the clarity) but still works well.

Pour is pretty much as anticipated with a good yellow hue, some very good looking, rocky head and a minor chill haze apparent. The aroma, taste and mouthfeel are all rolled into one. A very mildly hoppy experience with a lovely silky feel but with an understated dry finish. The combination of bitterness and Belgian works much better than in, say the Houblon Chouffe, and this is just more subtle and a better put together beer. A little mild grapefruit in there too, and incredibly light on its feet. The spices leave you with no doubt that you are still drinking a quintessential Belgian and the beer comes together very nicely.

The beer arrived in a thistle type glass, as black as night and with about a quarter of an inch of dark, mocha colored, highly pitted, dense foam being supported by the upper surface of the beer's body. What I first notice is that when I lift the glass to get a good whiff, it appears as though the glassware has an unusually thick or dense foot. Closer inspection suggests that it is actually the sheer density of the liquid inside the vessel that is causing this illusion. This is literally one HEAVY beer, and I don't recall recently experiencing anything quite like it. Like Mike said, you can almost feel the mass of the ingredients in the glass!
The aroma is powerful with plenty of burned malts, mild hops and the requisite chocolate, toffee and espresso hints. The mouthfeel is certainly thick, but it does not overpower the beer. The alcohol is certainly present, but again is in good balance. Nothing is too much, everything is well put together and constructed.
This beer grows on you as you consume the glass and I found this increasingly drinkable considering the ABV and the style (not known for its ease of consumption).

Nice orange, slightly clouded pour with excellent high head in the Duvel tulip. Head retention and lacing is not great, but OK.



Aroma is very peppery and this is a pre-cursor to a MASSIVE pepper flavor. There is a mixture of mild funk, light grapefruit, slight hops and perhaps a little cilantro but the white pepper is what prevails. It’s a very prevalent taste and feature of this beer. It even extends to the aftertaste where the pepper sits on the end of my tongue, giving some extra tingling sensations. Light on the mouthfeel which is OK because it adds to the tart refreshing nature.



This is true to the Fantome brand in as much as this is a very unusual beer and I bet this can vary greatly from batch to batch. In truth, I’m not mad about it, but having said that, despite the fact it is such an odd beast it was still surprisingly drinkable."

Pour came with a decent head, but lacked the huge pillowing effect that I was looking for. Color was a little too butterscotch influenced (lacked the yellow color, had more orange). Nose was especially lacking. No cloves, no bananas and just a little wheat. Mouthfeel was way too thin as well.



Some Hefe character in the taste, but it's all muted and thin. I don't know if this is a problem associated with the organic moniker, but it doesn't really cut it for a German Hefe. Disappointing effort."

Presumably 2006 vintage, but despite the bottle saying that ""Best Before Date and Lot Number"" are on the ""bottle top"", apparently they were not - not on the bottle itself or the cap (inside or out).



A still pour, with a real nice dark brown amber color with plenty of serious red highlights. Minimal lacing and head consistent with the ABV.



Very little hint of spice to place this in the WW category. Without question this appears to drink much more like an Old Ale. Aroma is VERY heavy on the sherry and port notes (which I like). These notes are very much upfront in the tastes too, but the beer ends VERY abruptly and sharp with some serious bitterness. It is grapefruit based, but not hop based - extreme burned notes, almost charcoal like.



I like this beer, and I like the WW style, but I don't think this beer IS a WW. As an Old Ale it works, until the exremely bitter end. A slightly odd marriage of styles but an interesting beer, especially for the holiday period."

$3.50 on-tap, Taco Mac, Douglasville, GA, USA. 
Quite light, but still a decent brown sugar golden color with nice clarity. Little head and low head retention.
Some odd kind of plastic/metal taste which is persistent and annoying. Dry and hoppy finish with a little alcohol in the finish too. Some decent bitterness at the end. I was a little confused over the odd, difficult to place ""funny"" taste. I suppose this could be down to a number of factors (how well the beer is kept?, age?, organic?, adjuncts? or something else), but in any case I found it off-putting to say the least. Without that, I think this beer has some potential and I would like to try a really fresh sample."

OK, first off I'm of the opinion that this fits much better in the category of English ESB.

Very significant pop on opening.The pour is good looking with a cloudy orange pour and a large head. The carbonation is extreme and annoying.



Significant sweet Belgian candy and some yeast notes in the nose. The taste has a surprising hop base and all of the typical Belgian notes (candied sugar, yeast). I am not a huge fan of the hop influence in the Belgian style and it grates a little with me - doesn't quite sit correctly. It seems to cloud the taste and introduces some Saison funk notes. A bit of an odd beast.



I think that this beer lacks the depth and taste that a Belgian Strong Dark should have, and it drinks much more lightly. The mouthfeel is both too light AND annoyingly carbonated, neither of which help the beer in the context of the style.



Not the best beer in the style, but despite that still interesting."

Finishes quite harshly with a burst of fresh hops. Quite green, sharp and clean a nice beer.



Only complaint here is if this is supposed to be an ESB it horribly out of style for me. This feels much more like an American IPA (green, vinous hop profile) ad lacks subtlety, body and smoothness. Quite edgy. As an American IPA I like it, as an ESB it's all wrong."

In many ways this reminds me of a chocolate based stout.

First off it's NOTHING like a bock to me. Medium brown pour with a decent head, but it fades quickly. The smell and taste are UTTERLY bland and weak. Lots of wet cardboard, some nasty plastic aftertaste and a mild bitterness. I have no idea what they were attempting to do here, but whatever it is they failed. It drinks a little like a homebrew where the brewer forgot to add an ingredient. It kind of resembles ""beer"", but it has no character or characteristics that would distinguish it from slightly bitter grain water.

Don't really know why, but I've passed up the chance to try this on several occasions and have only got around to trying it and reviewing after several years of not bothering. Shame, because I really like it.



Much more orange color in the pour than a traditional, light pure yellow Pils, and a bigger head with more dense fluff characteristics and good lacing. Nice looking beer.



Aroma has hops, but not astringent and sharp. MUCH more rounded with a fuller feel than a bitter smell. Mouthfeel is large and rounded and the taste has sweetness, subtlety and a very mild aspirin bitterness. That aspirin feel is a difficult one to pull off because if it gets to a certain level it is nasty, but this walks the line carefully and successfully.



Drinkability is good, and this reminds me less of a pure pils and more like a Pils and other lager, hybrid. I like the combination and it strikes me as a very interesting crossover beer with session potential too. Having said that it does seem to drink a little above the advertised 5.2%.

Pours jet black with a wonderful expresso like head that becomes a simple film fairly quickly. Milk chocolate color to the head and the spotty film. Perhaps the ""blackest"" beer I have encountered, but definitely not the most viscous.
Nose is all sweet alcohol and the initial tastes match that aroma. Actually a lot more sweetness upfront than I was expecting. This gives way to a big bitterness fairly quickly. The bitterness is a burned charcoal. Bitterness bites in the finish. Increasing charcoal and burned malts are present with a hint of hop bitterness but not much. A combination of early milk chocolate and then some later dark chocolate. The overwhelming sensation is a something burning! Coal comes to mind.
Mouthfeel is very good with a silky smoothness descending on the mouth pretty quickly.
Drinkability is not great, and this beer definitely fails to live up to the hype, but that's not at ALL surprising to me. All the nonsense about ""Dark Lord Day"" etc. is almost certain to raise the beer to silly heights that are difficult to live up to. Having said that, it's still a super drink that is worth trying once, but I would not bother making a great effort to seek this out again."

Review 01/10 ('05)

2005 Vintage, over four years old. Bottle #47750.
The aroma that is produced as soon as the bottle is opened is very intense. Quite a lot of sweet alcohol rises into the nostrils and it seems more potent than I remember in years gone by.
Pour still gives that slightly clouded, iced-tea look with a large bubbled head.
The sweet, toffee, caramel seems to have intensified and again I'm surprised by the presence of alcohol and how it makes such a strong appearance.
There also is a sneaky, spicy pepper that enters the fray - pretty interesting and odd.
All in all at this age the 2005 vintage seems to have a few tricks up its sleeve. It gave me one or two experiences (in the strong aroma, pronounced alcohol and peppery notes) that I wasn't anticipating. All against the backdrop of the usual malt based intensity that I expected.

Review 06/08 ('06)

I STILL get excited about opening & drinking this beer. This sitting is a 2006 vintage; number 72411.
I don't care what you say about this beer, it just keeps getting richer and more drinkable over time. The depth of the beer is extraordinary, and at the same time it is amazingly simple. This is just a HIGH class example of English brewing, and to be honest one of the VERY few English beers that actually holds its own in the bottle across the Atlantic.
Heaps of sherry and maderia notes come in wave after wave, and this is now coupled with a beautiful warming finish. The lace on the glass is exquisite (and better than I remember from the past), so I have bumped up the apearance score accordingly.
The nose also seems richer than ever with a liquor based marzipan dominating.
FIRST CLASS.

The 2004 vintage; number 76293 out of 95000.
$6.95 Liquor Barn, Lexington, KY, USA.
A little less clarity in the pour in December 2006 than I have seen in younger versions, and the lacing and head are not so spectacular (still good) as they have been in the past.
Outside of the appearance, much the same. Classic English bitter with everything hyped up. I know this is classified as an Old Ale - and it gets the style in terms of the amped-up alcohol and complexity, but it still maintains the wonderful biscuit malt balance that is typical of a simple English pint of bitter. Could you imagine this in a cask-aged version????

Cork pops with a pleasing burst, and the beer pours beautifully with a dense head of very fine bubbles forming on top of the Dubbel brown body into the Gouden Carolus glass. Head has a definite espresso feel about it, both in terms of the color and fine film it leaves on the surface.



Strong and typical aroma with plenty of dry, dark fruits, alcohol and Belgian yeast. Exactly the same is replicated in the taste with a lingering, round alcohol finish and some distant pepper too. The sweet candy also makes a brief appearance. Dry ending emphasizes the alcohol and fruit beautifully. Mouthfeel is light and silky - perfect for the style.

First of all this seems infinitely different to my original, on-tap serving from a couple of years ago. While that beer was really just like a strong DIPA, this beer drinks much higher in the alcohol stakes, and seems much less like an DIPA and more like a super-liquor laden bomb!
First impressions are all about the aroma. It is BIG. It's all sweet hops, soaked in mild liquor. I get huge amounts of figs, brandy and plums and it is exceptional. After I have recovered from the nose I can get a good look at the beer. Mid-orange body, nice rocky head and some lacing but not as huge as I was expecting. A surprisingly large amount of persistent carbonated bubbles rise from the bottom of the Sweetwater pilsner glass.
Amazingly sweet and alcohol laden, but for me it's still good. I'd bet that many would be put off by the combo, but to me it screams decadence. Even I like to drink this WITH a glass of cool water next to me. MUCH less hop presence than I remember from the tap a couple of years ago, this version seems a lot less bitter and more like an English Barleywine - not the American version of a BW with silly hop presence, but the original version with mega alcohol and sweetness. It reminds me of a Gold Label from years and years ago.
This is currently a vicious alcohol experience, but remains amazingly drinkable. I'd imagine that many would hate this, but for me it's an extraordinary beer. Of late I have been a little underwhelmed by DFH (perhaps because they set the bar so high), but this reminds me of their greatness.

I end up drinking quite a lot of this beer, but it's really only by default.

Light yellow body, almost macro looking in terms of the color, and a light and wispy head. Some lacing, but not a great deal.

Definite mild lactose sweetness, but again this is in check and manageable. The real weak spot is the mouthfeel which I think is a little thin for the style and the beer.

Pretty decent looker with a nice tan head and burgandy body. Not much lace, and the head dies quickly - rather too carbonated for the style.



Nose reveals a yeasty fruit, but it lacks the real depth that one would expect. Not much there. The tastes continue the theme. Yeast, acid and a lack of fruit depth.

A lot of sweetness in the initial tastes but this quickly gives way to a sharp, cherry based tart finish. The tart finish seems to stick in the throat a bit and is quite astrigent. Mild heartburn results. The whole package is a bit too reminiscent of cough syrup for my liking, including the body which is not much fun.



Definitely glad that I tried it, but I don't think I would bother again and under no circumstances is this an easy drinker. Perhaps a small glass with desert once a year, but as a ""beer"" this is not really a go. Can you say ""Marinade""?"

I first saw this in Atlanta a few weeks ago at the Taco Mac in Marietta and at that time the barman advised me against it since he thought it was sour or perhaps even off. I avoided it then, but a couple of weeks later a barman gave me a taster at the Decatur Taco Mac. I thought it still tasted very sour and it seemed very, very thin.
So, fast forward to today and I find myself at Taco Mac in Douglasville which had just got this in yesterday, and I finally decided I should order it and try it properly for myself - a mistake.
Looks are not bad with some thin lacing and a decent brown body. Mouthfeel is the real problem here. Woefully weak and completely lacking any kind of substance for a Porter. The tastes are not much better. A distinct acid/apple acidity, much like an infected beer. Sour and weak, a poor effort.
Mild cocoa or coffee aftertaste but it remins an afterthought.

I suspect that this beer is going to be horribly misuderstood in the USA. People without the knowledge or experience of an ENGLISH IPA will think that this is just too light and not hoppy enough. The mistake that they will be making is that the English (original) version of the IPA is always going to be more balanced and understated, without feeling the need to shove the hops down your throat.



Orange pour with some scant lacing and a disappointing lack of head. Not the best looking beer I've ever seen. Simple malt and hop balance in the nose and the taste. Biscuit flavors in the background. Mild citrus peel and zest make up the bitterness, and as expected not a huge hop profile.

Aroma is yeasty alcohol, almost ""meaty""! Tastes reflect a typical, high quality Belgian Dark/Quad. Layer after layer of alcohol, dark plummy and fig based fruits. Candied sugar and yeasts back up the package. Full and silky mouthfeel - absolutely perfect. Soft and smooth, it exudes and feels like a wonderfully quality product.

22 oz Bomber, Green's, Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA.



First off there is nothing ""Belgian"" about this, nor is there much that makes it a Brown Ale. Typical for Rogue the hops are upfront, huge and out of balance. In this beer the hop presence is ridiculous for a Brown Ale, but not too overwhelming when you consider the Rogue style. Often Rogue can get completely out of hand, here it's just big.



This is really a Bitter, or perhaps even close to an Irish/Amber, but either way it's very hoppy. GREAT lacing with a nice, persistent head. Red clarity in the pour - simple, but really good looking.



In terms of the aroma and taste I could be drinking a souped up English bitter - added hops, ABV and bitterness, but you can feel a simple biscuit malt base underneath. Take a typical English Pale Ale/Bitter and ""Imperialize"" it, and you have this beer.



I think it would get tiring after a while, but a nice beer in small quantities. Definitely lacks sessionable qualities, but an interesting Rogue offering. One where their typical over-hopping doesn't kill the experience for me."

There's a real creamy sweetness about this beer, and a distinct lack of bitterness. VERY mild, sweet and ""lactose like"" considering the style. In fact the more I drink it, the more lactose notes that creep in. 



Slightly lighter body than one would expect for a RIS, but this does not detract from the enjoyment of the beer. Clean aftertaste, very tasty.

Aroma is light Belgian candy sweetness and some alcohol. Aroma carries through to the taste with some alcohol but rather a lot of roasted bitterness too. A little too bitter for the style I felt, and there is a lack of Belgian yeast and sweet candied character. Having said that it is still very tasty, perhaps just a little out of style.

ABC have been contract brewing a beer for a group of restaurants in the Atlanta area, noteably the Pie Bar, for some time. The Pie Bar has been marketing this as ""Numbers Ale"", but to my knowledge ABC has never sold this as such. Anyway, the word is that ABC are attempting to create a beer that they can market to groups of restaurants, namely Pizza joints, BBQ places and Mexican restaurants and each case it is likely to be a tweaked version of ""Numbers Ale"".



I drank a couple of pints of this at the Mellow Mushroom in Douglasville, GA, USA. I know that they (MM) are experimenting with this to see how well it sells, with the view to making this a much more permanent fixture. 



Mid orange color with decent head retention and some mild lacing, the beer looks like a typical APA (I don't know how MM/Pie Bar/ABC are actually classifying this, but I'm going with APA for now). Very mild grapefruit hop bitterness and a simple but well constructed malt profile. Very inoffensive, non-filling and a simple pleasure.

A sweet and sour experience with all kinds of things going on. Rather complex, but the complexity is a little overshadowed by the alcohol and the hop bitterness.

Dark brown pour that suffers from being served too cold, but after the beer wams all the attributes start to be enhanced and come through nicely. The temperature affected the pour making it look rather flat. After warming and with a little agitation we get what the beer should resemble Lovely deep color and excellent head and lacing.



Lovely nutty sweet nose. A little edgier than say, Rogue Hazelnut, but it has any of those great characteristics. Sweet nut nose and initial tastes, loads of sweet malts and a finish that is pleasing both in terms of the taste and bitterness. Very tasty, very moreish.



The nutty brown ales live and die by their mouthfeel and their ability to hold together the whole drink. Watery brown ales are a disaster and you need body - this one does the job well.

Typically Belgian, but with one or two odd twists. Firstly the body was very clear - almost like a macro lager. It did come with a great, rocky and pillowed frothy head and some chill haze, AND all the other usual Belgian attributes were in place; plenty of fruit character, typical Belgian sugars and yeasts and lots of spice character. Just like BEERchitect suggested, I got some salty tastes as well.
Rather against the grain was a lingering bitterness that didn't seem like a hop based flavor. Much more like some kind of artificial bitterness like Angostura. Nevertheless I still enjoyed it and found it to be very drinkable. If anyhting it seemed to drink a little stronger than the 7.3% ABV advertised."

Well, here we go with another Sam Calagione/DFH inspired ""concept"" (for want of a better term) beer. Frankly I'm not really *that* interested in the thinking behind such beers, only if they taste good now! The history and context is nice, but without a quality, highly drinakble product at the end of the process there is not much in it for consumers at the sharp end. DFH may have learned a lot about brewing via the process, but the drinkeres won't be very concerned with that. Luckily, this one does taste good!



Pours cloudy orange with a nicely formed, thick head that has some very good retention. Lacing is mid-range with a thickness that is a little deceiving. Sweet, honey based, slightly floral (hop) nose, light and rather attractive. Nice thick and satisfying mouthfeel - seems quite luxurious - velvet like.



Tastes are light and sweet. Honey with some very mild acidity. Much like the DFH Pangaea, this feels like a bitter shandy with English lemonade (Sprite/7-Up) added to a low ABV sessionable typical bitter. It's very drinkable but ultimately quite poor value with a price tag of $12+ .



Very smooth and really easy to quaff, this is a very interesting beer, but it's a little pricey for what it is. Worth a one-off purchase definitely, but I don't think I could justify regularly spending the cash for this brew. Since we don't get DFH in GA, that's not really a huge problem!"

Nice light color, but a fast fading head. A small amount of lacing.
To me this drinks more like a hybrid English/American IPA. It lacks the biscuit malt subtlety of a typical English Pale Ale or Bitter, and it fails to deliver that mild fruity aftertaste, but it does compensate for some of those shortfalls with pleasing American IPA bitterness that I was not expecting.
A little more harsh than I would like, with a bit of fruity acidity up front. Once you get used to it it's not unpleasant, just a bit alarming at the beginning. Fruit continues throughout the beer, and in the finish the hops compliment them well. I get pears and pineapple? perhaps.
Not bad, a good everyday beer and decent ""sessionable"" potential, but not your classic English Bitter by any stretch of the imagination."

To be fair this was fairly unoffensive, but that's where the compliments end. Decent orange color with good clarity but the usual lack of life. No head, no lace, looks dead.

In terms of taste it drank like a quality American micro IPA. Nothing really special, but solid, realiable everyday drinking and at these prices it would be!

I like this beer mainly becasue it is typically ""American IPA"", but it seems to have a West Coast feel that IS in balance. Unusual for some West Coast over hopped IPA's. I suppose that in that respect this will disappoint some, but for me it incorporated all the good things about the American version of the style without the resin based mouth stripping hops that cn sometimes accompany the style.

Aroma is muted sweet malts. A DEFINITE smokiness! Odd.



Tastes are somewhat typically ""British"" IPA with a distinct lack of hops (I've been in the USA too long!) Finishes dry, but that's OK since the malts earlier in the drink support the whole thing nicely. More light smoke.



Don't come here looking for a hop-bomb, you won't find it, but what you do get is a nice biscuit malt British Pale Ale with a bit of a added hop dry finish.



A little over carbonated for my taste. Nice malted aftertaste. A bit of an odd combination, but despite that it drinks and tastes above average."

Purchased as a single on a recent rip to Lexington, KY. 12 oz bottle. GREAT clarity with a copper color and a nicely formed, capped head. No lacing. Some decent legs.
Aroma is the typical spice with sweet alcohol notes. Taste is a tad more alcoholic than many of the style, but it still drinks with plenty of orange flavors. A little more tart (citrus peel) than other Christmas spiced ales.
Definitely of the genre and the style, but it has a characteristic and slightly different flavor. One of my favorite styles, this is a tiny bit too edgy for the style for me since I like more malt content and some bigger body. Having said that a nice beer."

Cloudy, honey colored pour with excessive carbonation. The carbonation is too much for me, too much for the style and frankly a little annoying. Some sticky lacing and some foamy head but it is a little inconsistent. The carbonation imparts a prickly mouthfeel that I don't much care for.



This is a VERY typical over-the-top American Double IPA. Huge, west coast style piney and resinous hops that are frankly a little out of balance. While this is NOT a bad beer, for me it typifies a lot of what is wrong with the American version of this style. Hops way too green and out of whack and it seems big for the sake of being being and lacks balance and subtlety. I did enjoy it a little more with a small knob of strong English cheddar - it seemed to mellow out the mouthfuls.



The kind of beer I CAN drink, but it lacks craft in my opinion. The kind of thing I feel I could knock up in the basement myself."

I was worried that nostalgia was getting the better of me, and that I would be terribly disappointed, but it held up extremely well.
Very, very nice in all respects. Sweet yeasty malts, velvet smooth in the mouth and quaffable by the bucket load. Probably too sweet for many, to me this is a typically rich, alcoholic and smooth Belgian - a treat that with a sensible ABV I can enjoy lots of.

It's an extraordinary beer, in fact in many ways it's barely a beer, but it is just about what I expected.



Pour is a deep orange viscous liquid with a head that disappears immediately. Amazingly sweet nose and tastes but the finish tempered by a really nice, warming smooth port finish. At 11.50 % this is close to unbelievable. The alcohol is there and is warming, but hardly noticeable. I could drink a huge amount of this - I'd probably regret it, but the drinkability is off the charts. Obviously amazingly rich.

Cloudy, butterscotch pour with a decent head, but shortlived. Some lacing. An odd aroma of licorice at first followed by a more familar corriander, lemon and orange. Mouthfeel is a little prickly and too carbonated for my liking.

Pours Porter black/brown with a nice head and some decent lacing. A good fruity, alcohol type aroma that is frankly better than the taste. The body (or lack of it) lets this beer down. Thin and a little unsatisfying. A wee bit dry and earthy too.

Aroma is amazing. Sweet, sweet smoke that is obvious but beautifully understated. NOT like many Rauchbiers that I have had.

2008 vintage from a 12oz bottle.
Thought that it was time to re-review a fresh vintage so here we go with the 2008 version.
The usual dark, dark brown almost black pour with the promise of a creamy experience in the head and lace. Large, creamy and coffee-milky bubbles form at the edge of the head. Some lace.
Nose and tastes this year seems a little less spicy to me, but there is a VERY distinct harsher, solvent alcohol edge to this beer.

This is a little bit unusual amongst the bottled English PA's that make it to the US. There is a much more pronounced dry bitterness about this. Not that those characteristics are unusual in an English bitter in general, but it is a bit odd in one of these imported PA's.

I was very suprised at the level of sweetness in this beer. Coupled with the rather significant orange and alcohol content this drank a bit like a beery Cointreau - seriously! Despite the potentially unappetizing sound of that combo, the drinkability is off the charts (a 5+). Oily mouthfeel without going too far and a satisfying bite.

In terms of the style this is not a typical Saison and it is appropriate that it was poured into the Duvel tulip because this is somewhat reminiscent of that great beer, and it drinks much more like a spicy Belgian Pale or Wit than a Saison.



Fantastic clarity and color. A deep golden body (really beautiful), a big head, some lacing and some nice spotty cream left on the surface. Good carbonation. A slight viscosity associated with the pour too.



Smooth, easy drinking with some yeasty bitterness. The yeast taste is pronounced despite this being a filtered offering. The alcohol content seems well above 6.6% ABV (on label) and feels much more like 7.70 ABV (on the BA database).

Decent value at around $6 for a sixer, and I might just buy one sixer each year to have on hand for curious guests. I suppose it has some Autumn crossover potential.

As far as the taste goes I was impressed with the way it literally mimicked what it claimed on the label - DEFINITE ""licorice"" notes, ""assertive hop finish"" and ""medium bodied"" so at least it has that going for it. However, for me the licorice was a little too much, so the Porter became more like a dry stout without the creaminess of a Porter. I suppose that Jim Koch is saying that this is what a Porter once was, but for me it's disappointing in the context of what I want from a Porter now.

Aroma and tstes give the JP signature acid/funk. OK, now I am beginning to lose some patience with the brewery. This is nothing like a contemporary Wit, and to describe it as such is plain misleading. I like the taste of the beer with that typical West Country (England) farmhouse cider twang, but this is totally out of the modern Belgian Wit style. Perhaps it IS true to some traditional Wit, but for now this is not what I want to purchase when the label says Wit, hence, although I like it, I still took significant points off.

I dunno, this is the second Jolly Pumpkin offering that I have had, and the experience has been almost identical in each case. There is an inordinate amount of funk and acidity that would be OK in a cross between a Flanders Red and a Saison/Wild, but seems horribly out of place in a beer that is categorized as a Belgian Pale. I think if you are drinking this and expecting a typical sweet, candied mildly spiced Belgian, you are going to be very disappointed. If you are a fan of sour beers you'll probably enjoy this - I'm not, so I was slightly let down. I found pretty much he same thing with La Roja; http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/9897/19314/?ba=Ding.

If you open this, drink it and score it as a RIS, you are going to be disappointed and critical. However, if you take it for what it is (rather than the somewhat arbitrary category that it is placed into) then you will probably enjoy it.



Mouthfeel is very light, but not thin, and this feature enhances the drinkability. Alcohol is very well hidden and the tastes are very chocolate based. Nice, tasty and drinkable. Low hop profile, a lack of bitterness which was a nice change. Almost light enough to be considered a Porter rather than a Stout, which is very odd for a beer that is categorized as a RI stout.

Mmm, bizarre that after drinking a gazillion pints of this in the past I have never formally reviewed this. Also bizarre that the first time I am reviewing it I am drinking it in the USA! Funny how things work out sometimes. Anyway……



Served too cold (as usual I had to intercept the frosted glass that this was about to be poured into! Can you believe it?) and with a criminal neglect of creating a decent head this makes a mockery of what this beer can (and should) look like. Allowing it to come up to the correct temperature solves half of that problem.



Outside of the appearance and lack of general care, this beer still manages to impart at least some of the characteristics I would expect to find closer to the source. A pronounced dry biscuit maltiness and a stronger than expected hop finish. Caramel overtones too – a classic, lower ABV sessionable English Bitter.



This review in NO way reflects my real love of this beer in its “real” format in England, but it does give a small reminder of how great beer in general (and this beer in particular) can be. A pint in Chiswick would probably be close to all fives, but for now this will have to do."

Nice bottle presentation in the 750 mL size, $7.99 in lots of Atlanta outlets. This has been in GA for a few months.



On opening, a large amount of carbonation serves to spill quite a substantial amount of the contents over the counter - a little annoying but I can get over it. In the Duvel tulip this has great presence in terms of the head and lacing (EXCELLENT), but the body has a ruddy red, dirty appearance that is less attractive. This color is a pet peeve of mine (a nasty, murky color with some floaties) and without it this would otherwise be a 5 on the appearance score.



Taste and aroma are one and the same. Funky, earthy acidic farmhouse notes. Basically this is a refined Flanders Red with acidity lower than you would find in something like a Rodenbach, but still maintaining the classic English, West Country rural cider notes. Definitely has a countryside feel with plenty of ""horse-blanket"" and Saison funk - which is very acceptable for the style - but at the same time gives a greater acidity than I would expect.



I'm confused over the style. Biere de Garde to me means 3 Monts and Jenlain. This is ""Rodenbach Lite"", a Flanders Red that is less assertive and aggressive with out the drinkability and sweetness I have previously associated with the style. I guess my education continues!

Way too sweet, even for my sweet tooth, and the package seems hurriedly put together. Unbalanced and it gives the impression that this is a big beer for big beers sake. Failed to finish half of the bottle, not because I couldn't manage it, but becasue it really wasn't nice to drink."

Aftertaste is all evaporating alcohol, almost as if you can feel the alcohol rising to the roof of the mouth and in the back of the throat. There is more of a mouth and tongue coating with the draft version than the bottle but it is still very light. Rich.

It's probably close to eight years ago that I last drink this, so my memories of the stuff earlier than 1998 are a little faded, but even if that is the case I was still bitterly disappointed by the bottle of the 2004 vintage that I recently drank.
Very unattractive pour on three levels. Firstly the color was that of stale, cold tea, secondly there was a suspicious looking murkiness to it and thirdly the lack of life in the pour was alarming. Don't get me wrong, at 11. something% and with the style taken into consideration I was not expecting visual fireworks, but I just don't recall this looking so drab in the past.
Anyway, getting on with the important stuff the nose was as expected, wonderful. A combination of alcohol soaked fruits and dark sherries and ports lifted my spirits. Alas, the taste failed to match that by some significant distance. It had an initial burst of what I was expecting - a reflection of the nose - but then there came this nasty lack of balance with a very strong soap taste that I can only assume was the hops asserting themselves. Very off-putting and completely overwhelmed the rest of the beer. Soap, soap, soap!
Mouthfeel was as expected with a sweet, cloying coating, but not unpleasant.
I dunno, maybe my rose tinted memories are playing tricks with me, maybe this is simply too young, or maybe O'Hanlon's have really f'ed this up, whichever is true, for now at least, I will not be drinking any more TH vintages with less than 5 years under their belt."

Malty and distinct lack of hop bitterness in keeping with the style. The nose offers up some sweet bourbon type alcohol.



If this looked better it really would be a cracking Bock, as it is it is very nice but let down by the lack of carbonation and therefore by its appearance. When I poured this I thought I was going to be disappointed but it drank above expectations."

Poured into a pint glass. Very, very light orange pour. Smallish head with a little lacing. Nose has a little hop character but not much.

After a brief hiatus, Goudenband is BACK in the USA! I picked this up a couple of weeks ago and just got around to cracking the new packaging today.
There seems to be a greater clarity about the body on this new version. Head is small but produces a lovely creamy film on top of the beer. Looks a little better than I remember; +0.5 on the appearance.
Still the same balance of tart and sweet but perhaps a little more emphasis on the fruit angle. Less sweet than my original notes would suggest. This of course, could simply be a palate changing issue.
Still rich in the mouth.
It's a great beer - still.

Frankly, I often stay away from Oud Bruins, but at $3.99 for a 750 mL on sale at Whitlock Package in Marietta, GA, USA, it was too difficult to resist. I'm glad I went with it.
Corked and caged, the pop on releasing the cap was worryingly poor. The corked had shriveled to half of its normal size (like a button mushroom), but it revealed the 2004 date stamped on it. Should be good with a couple of years of age on it.
Poured into the Gouden Carolus mini chalice the head is surprisingly good, but the body reveals that nasty Dubbel, dirty brown appearance - always disappoints me. Nice lacing.
Aroma has a hint of sourness, but it's not big.
Very malty and sweet which is EXTREMELY surprising to me. The sourness only comes through right at the end of the beer and in the aftertaste - not typically sour at all. Creamy in the mouth and the finish has some alcohol too. Very nice mouthfeel.
Delicious and I enjoyed it immensely - another example of why you should persist with styles that are not your favorite!"

Fantastic looking pour with a massive rocky head that has great retention. Copper red body with a lot of clarity. Lovely sticky lacing left behind. Looks? It's a 5!



Big hops, but it's really mellow - not astrigent at all. Couple this with magnificent malts and a subtle rye flavor and you have one delicious beer. Beautifully full hop burps are induced as I gulp this one down.



Very satisfying and smooth the mouthfeel is both silky and light, but it also gives a fullness that seems in direct contradiction to that. Whatever it does to achieve this, it works very well.



Frankly a real all around winner. A multi-faceted beer with a lot to offer. Very nice.



The second bottle of this gave me a much greater Rye taste than the original bottle from the same pack, and I liked it a little less. Still nice, but a little more bitter."

Thanks go out to Silentsabre and Beerbeing for the opportunity to try this one.
Light orange marmalade colored body with good clarity and a very light head. Some retention but both the head and lacing are very fine and delicate rather than substantial.
Sweet hops in the nose with some organic hay type smells. Pretty light mouthfeel, but refreshing.
Hops are big and upfront, but at the same time really refreshing and moreish. Significant sweet character too. Some decent metallic hops in the aftertaste as well.
Not as big a hop bomb as I was expecting*, but a very nice beer. 
*This beer is a few months old so no doubt they have been tempered somewhat."

A lot of alcohol and yeast notes in the nose.

Nice half-inch tan colored head forms on the pour, but this VERY quickly fades to absolutely NOTHING - I mean nothing, not even a spotty film - very disappointing. As a result of the wimpy pour, absoultely no lacing either. After that it sits there, looking like a coke.



Nose is pretty alcoholic with some bananas. Mouthfeel is good, quite rich and smooth.



Taste hightlights the alcohol and not much else. Warming on the way down, but generally disappointing. Some smoke?? Not at all complex or interesting.



I dunno, just one of those beers that failed to meet the hype for me. That in itself is not that unusual, but I guess the fact that this is a style that I really like, made it feel more of a let down. Ho Hum."

As others have noted, a certain brandy like aroma.



Definite smokiness in the taste (the oak?), along with plenty of alcohol, but it drinks suprisingly smoothly. I think the smoothness is due to the vanilla and maple advertised on the label, but it doesn't really manifest itself as a taste, more of a ""feeling"". Actually rather fruity. Mouthfeel is slick, and that's fine considering the ABV, and to be honest it's actually rather nice - not cloying at all.

Champagne bottle presentation going beyond just corked and caged with gold foil down the length of the neck and with a dimpled bottom of the bottle. Corked has 11-2003 on it so this is close to three years old.



Apart from the color (another dirty brown opaque, Dubbel type pour) it looks great. BIg head and great lacing. If this had the color of a Belgian Pale I would give it a 5, but for now the dirt color marks it down.



Nose has alcohol but also a tart citrus nature. The citrus is definitely NOT carried through to the taste.



The taste is very sweet and complex. Huge sugars and fruits overlapping one another with a Belgian yeast background makes this a BIG beer. The sweetness will kill it for some people, but if you like sweet, you'll love this.



A little alcohol burn in the finish. 11%?? It drinks nowhere near that though. This is a very dangerous beer!

Golden viscous pour with a poorly retained head and no lace. Fair enough, at &gt;10% ABV I was not expecting much. Nose is basically sugared alcohol and not much else. Tastes reflect those attributes with some burning alcohol and a sweet tripel twang. Not much else. Finish is burning and dry.

Well, no mystery here. Typical Dark Belgian attributes all over the place from the aroma to the tastes. Yeast and spice with a couple of slight differences. Mouthfeel and alcohol are both below what I would normally expect. Now, that can be taken one of two ways - either it is a bit disappointing, or it makes it easier to drink and a little more refreshing than most of the style. For now, it doesn't bother me and it is a refreshing change. Plenty of dark fruits hit the tongue after a very brief initial bitterness. An extremely tasty beer.
I would say this is slightly outside the norm, almost like a ""light"" Dark Belgian. Makes it an interesting choice for a hot day in Georgia."

12oz can, thanks to BA sulldaddy for the excellent trade.
Poured into the Atlanta Brewing Red Brick Ale pint glass. Head is initially good but fades fast to nothing. A small ring of lace remains on the surface of the beer. 
Another solid, everyday drinking kind of IPA for me. Crystal clear amber body with the minimum of carbonation. Good herbal, hoppy aroma eminates from the glass and the mild tastes make this a simple, but effective beer. Slight lingering bitterness in the finish, it melds together nicely for a delicious experience. Some grapefruit and bitterness in there but very little.
Crisp and clean, another nicely put together beer, and in a can as well! Some nice hoppy burps too!"

I suppose that you might want to put this in the ""West Coast"" APA category since it has a pretty high hop intensity for an APA. Don't get me wrong, this is not an IPA, but at the same time there is a much greater hop presence than I would normally associate with the style.



Huge carbonation (a little annoying if I'm honest) sits on top of the cloudy orange body. Once the froth has died down it looks good. Mild citrus dominates but this is a very rounded beer. Drinking is very easy and the manageable ABV puts this down as a potential session brew. Sweet and smooth in the finish, I enjoyed it. The kind of beer that could become an everyday favorite if I was local."

Purchased at Kybecca, Fredericksburg, VA, USA. $7+ for the last bottle in the cooler.
Poured in to the Val-Dieu goblet. Still has the dark, dark brown almost black body. Very thin spotty head despite the aggressive pour. Some flakes and floaties in the body of the pour.
Aroma is deeper now than I remember from a couple of years ago. Mouthfeel is still creamy.
The taste really doesn't seemed to have mellowed out much - a tad disappointing. It certainly maintains that aniseed bitterness that I thought might have been tempered down somewhat.
Still enjoyed it, but I am a little surprised that this had not changed more. Still a bit edgy - I'd like to see a mellower Belgian.

22oz bomber. Thanks to BA Boolshot for a great trade.
Dark, dark brown in the Chimay chalice. Tan head that is not very impressive, somewhat thin and leaves a little spottiness on the surface. Alcohol in the nose with some typical Belgian sugar, spice and yeast notes.
As others have observed there is a definite aniseed taste in there somewhere. It manifests itself in some bitterness which seems a little out of place. Mouthfeel is luxurious and delicious. Outside of that it's typically spiced Belgian but with an unusual dark chocolate taste mixed in. Very nice.
The finish is too bitter in my opinion and lacks subtlety. I wouldn't be surprised if this mellowed over time and if it does, this beer would have improved a great deal. Despite all of that I found myself drinking this very quickly so it's obviously not all that bad!"

Hazy, burnt orange colored pour with a huge, dirty froth head (the kind you see at the beach). Poured into the Southampton Weizen glass, the beer slips under the head to enter the mouth without any head presence. A small amount of random lacing, but this is also very airy.



Nose is hoppy, but not big by the stanadards of most American DIPA's. Some alcohol in the nose, and this is replicted in the finish.



Alcoholic, sweet hops are the main tastes. There is no way that this is a hop bomb (because to me the alcohol is too evident), but it still is going to be pleasing to those seeking a big, bitter beer. A little thin and slick in the mouth - I was hoping for a fuller experience - this is this beers weak point.



It's nearly there, but to me the alcohol is a little too prominent in the profile and it overtakes what the brewer is (probably) trying to achieve which is much more of a hop beast. A little pricy too, this doesn't quite deliver, although it's still a nice beer."

This is not the best beer that I have had from Stone - not by long chalk. The main problem here is with the style. In a Brown Ale I'm looking for a simple, malt based (low hop presence) easy drinking beer with some sweet notes and probably a pretty low alcohol. This fails on three counts and as a result the drinkability is low. There is a high alcohol taste combined with a hoppy note, all amongst a chocolate-cocoa powedery mouthfeel. A poor combo under any circumstances but in a Brown Ale it's even worse.



Alcohol in the nose too - it's all a little too much.



Stone is a great brewer whom I have a lot of respect for and I love most of their beers, but this is not one of them. A blip."

Pour is certainly red, but it goes from a dark red when the oversized wineglass is full, to a slightly more pink color when it is nearly empty. Quite a lot of dark burgandy sediment form which looks a lot like fruit sediment. Plenty of good wispy lacing.



As far as the aroma goes there are rasperberries in the extreme, but to me it is not overwhelming or nasty.

I would describe this is as an above average version of the style. Nice looking brown pour with quite a lot of carbonation. Despite the carbonation the head fades diappointingly quickly though, especially considering the amount of froth that is generated from the opening the bottle.



Malty nose as expected, but the first sip reveals a mouthfeel that is too thin for me. Not overtly so, but definitely a little lacking. The lack of body hurts this beer. Tastes are similarly malt based, but a lack of bitterness and a general insipid experience combine to make this somewhat forgettable - not unpleasant, but just another average beer that you could easily knock up in your basement if you were a proficient homebrewer.

More of a golden pour than an orange one, this beer gives a small, light and frothy head rather than one with any density. Some nice lacing.



Definitely a West Coast feel about this very bitter IPA. It's in the American IPA tradition, with very strong accents on the metallic, grapefruit bitterness which is quite dry. Not a great deal of balance here which is fine as long as you are in the mood for a back of the tongue, bitter experience. This is not overly bitter but the lack of malt gives a singular experience. Mouthfeel is pretty thin too.



Dry and not much subtlety, the aftertaste remains very metallic. This is clearly a well crafted beer, but on a personal note this is a wee bit one dimensional for me. I very much enjoyed the one bottle I drank, but after it I was seeking something with more balance."

To call this an American IPA doesn't do it justice. This drinks like a BIG, BOLD American Strong Ale, something along the lines of an Arrogant Bastard.
This brew looks truly beautiful in the Tucher Weizen glass with a mid-amber pour, a lovely, thick dense head that hangs around for ages, and some really nice thick lacing.
Massive grapefruit and pine in the nose. Surprisingly the Rye is not there in much evidence, nor in the taste, but the hops are - My-oh-my, the hops are there! Potent, stinging bitterness that lingers perfectly. It drinks beyond its ABV and the tastes are truly large. Aftertaste is truly great - metallic, smooth, creamy bitternes - first class.

I found the hops to be up front, more so than in several Pils, and there is a lack of bitterness in the finish which I would normally flag as a typical characteristic of the style. 



I would call this a slightly unusual Pils in some ways, but it is refeshing and tasty so I would say worth seeking out. Nice."

Color is that beautiful, dark red rust, with a nice yellow fine bubbled head. There is a massive malt backbone against which hangs a fairly astringent bitterness.

18 month old bottle. $5.99 Cheers, Carrollton, GA, USA.
Although the carbonation is still there with an aggressive pour, after the initial life it is pretty much dead. Quite smooth and sweet with a touch of oxidation, this drinks ""wine-like"" and has a little note of sherry and maderia. Alcohol seems to have toned down a lot. Alcohol is still in the nose, but the taste of it has mellowed.
Finish is only lightly alcoholic as opposed to harshly.
To be honest, this is a little thin in the mouth after the aging.

First off, I definitely think that this is a Weizenbock rather than a Doppelbock. Putting that aside it pours an amazingly dark, garnet red color with a big head that gives great lacing. The pour is viscous and sticky and the mouthfeel reflects that sugary combination.
Aroma is quite strong with alcohol very prominent. Taste is excellent and typical of the style - very sweet, alcohol and warming malts. No hops obvious. This does drink up to its 9.5% ABV, and in that respect it is a big beer, but unusually this does not seem to detract from the drinkability. A massive beer that is easy to drink - take care!
Finish is warming and alcoholic, but this is a delicious beer. A very solid example of one of my favorite styles."

Corriander spice notes in the nose. Taste is pronounced peppery and dry, with a hop finish that is very surprising for the style. Like De Ranke XX and Houblon Chouffe, this is a hoppy Belgian that lacks much rich, fruit flavor, but has the mild grapefruit bitterness instead.

Firstly thanks go out to Travis (BA BigLove) for the bottle with no label.
Classic, hazed orange IPA body with a spectacular head and some very nice lacing. Appearance smacks of quality.
Plenty of citrus pine hops in the nose.
Balance is the key word here. Lots of IPA pine hop character, but the solid pale malts make those hops underwhelming. I bet that I like this much more than many American BA's who have been bombarded with hop bomb after hop bomb in this category.
Very English in its character with an understated hop presence and a super biscuit malt balance. Taste is reserved, which will not suit some, but for me it is refreshing, light and a great change in pace. Perfect balance in the finish too, with sweet and dry competing in a delicate dance.
Drinkability is off the charts. Very, very subtle and has quality written all over it."

One half inch, dense pock marked head sits atop the dark brown, almost Dubbel like body. Color is not the most attractive. The head fades but leaves that tell-tale spotty and creamy deposit for the remainder of the beer - a sure sign of a quality product.



Rich nose with the classic figs, prunes, dark sugar and raisin notes. Excellent.



Taste has all the characteristics of a Belgian dark, but has an added bitterness. The bitterness lingers a little too long for me, and takes the edge off the beer. I would befinitely prefer a mellower experience.



Some alcohol notes are prominent, but despite this the beer drinks easily, if somewhat of a sipper.

This is absolutely typical of an English Barleywine. Smooth, intensely fruity with plums, figs, raisins and oranges making up a very, very dense fruit and alcohol. Very little hop essence, so unlike its American interpretation. I am often reminded as to how much the two versions differ.

Thanks to Tom (warriorsoul) for the trade. Winter version.
Mid-orange pour with a nice head and some serious, sticky lacing. Some good carbonation.
Very solid, highly hopped DIPA - obviously; but not so obviously a rather viscous mouthfeel. The combination of the viscosity and the hops make this drink rather too much like an American Barleywine for my own tastes, but that's just me.
Plenty of hops in the nose, but I also get some tea. 
The taste is really quite sweet. Lots of smoothness too, and still some of that tea residual flavor hanging around. Finishes with a light citrus touch - very mild grapefruit.
Quite heavy on the sweetness and as a result in lacks the punch, clean feel and snap of a DIPA for me, so overall not my favorite. Better than average? Certainly. One of the very best? Not in my book."

Great looking pour with a darker than expected, real gold color - not really ""Golden"", but literally Gold color. Very nice carbonation and a relatively aggressive pour gives a big head and good lacing.
Definite viscous feel to the beer in the mouth (as expected) it feels luxurious. Light syrup sweetness with the hoppy finish.
I really like the rich feel to this style. It really feels like you are experiencing something out of the ordinary. Reminiscent of Rogue's version of the style, but better value and a slightly more bitter, hoppy edge with the sweetness toned down a little. Still sweet, but ironically slightly more hopped than the Morimoto.

This poured with a more modest head than the Chouffe and with less yellow color. This was much more orange and was more reserved to look at. Still excellent lacing and a nice persistent foamy head.
Aroma gave away the Belgian character with layered sugary yeast smells, but also the delicate hops.

Appearance is a straight 5. No doubt. Attractive, hazed orange body topped with a massive foamy and rocky head. The head subsides slowly to leave what looks like beaten egg whites, dense, creamy and pillow-like and the lacing is some of the best I can recall EVER seeing!



Aroma is typically Belgian with the spice and yeast overtones coming through strong. Surprisingly a distinct lack of hops in the nose.



Well, it's certainly hoppy in a way that Belgian beers are not, and in that respect it is very reminiscent of a De Ranke XX. An amazing amount of grapefruit citrus tastes, but surprisingly not hop tasting. The Tripel undertone is constant, and as the beer warms the sweetness begins to come through. At this stage the grapefruit bitterness is only really present in the sharp and short finish.



Mouthfeel is a bit soapy and to be honest the whole thing sits a bit awkwardly.



For me this ends up being a little bit caught in no-mans land. An odd marriage of competing styles, that while definitely interesting, fails to pull it off.

I know that this was originally only released in the USA since the brewer thought that the best place for a large IPA to be appreciated would be on this side of the pond. The logic presumably being that a big hop bomb would be a little too much for contemporary English taste buds - OK, fair enough, it all makes sense so far, but when I taste this, that logic goes out of the window. 
Don't get me wrong, I love this beer, but because it was initially reserved for the ""hop loving"" American market I was expecting a West Coast style punch in the face. Instead I got what I know and love to be the English IPA style; subtle, loving, Fuggles and Goldings, and I could almost be in Kent! If my compatriots at home have abandoned drinking this kind of beer the end is nigh! Anyway, back to the drink. Cloudy amber, great head and lacing and big blunt, butter hop aroma in the style of a great English cask. Carbonation is low (after the initial mild bottle fizz) and it sits there looking majestic.
Low bitterness with plenty of malt, but the key here is/are the subtle tones. I'd be surprised if this appealed to the folks familiar with American IPA's, but I would be equally surprised if the English BA's thought this was too hoppy for their liking. Drinkability is beyond the scale and I love it."

Mild acidity and a very clean taste. Mouthfeel is light, but it matches the tastes.



Not a beer that you would want in any other condition other than highly chilled, and not a beer that you would want to be drinking outside of the context of a really hot day.

Mild sweetness in the taste, typically Belgian Tripel notes, but not nearly as sweet as many of the style. A definite champagne like dry finish too - if I had to choose one word I would say it was delicate.



Not huge in the mouth, but the fine bubbles make for a great velvet smooth experience.

Prior to that nightmarish event, he had promised me one of the Westy's, and despite the fact he only got to try one bottle for himself from the shipment, he still had the good grace to stick to his word and pass one of the survivors on to me - thanks man!



Anyway back to the beer. Pours exactly as you would expect a Dubbel to. Cloudy, dirty brown appearance, some floaties, but with a better than average head - frothy coffee type appearance, almost cappuccino in appearance.



Aroma is all fruit, especially bananas, and to be honest it had the whiff of what I would call a luxurious Hefe! The luxury is continued in the mouthfeel, very silky and smooth especially considering the style of beer we are dealing with here.



On to the taste - very typically Belgian Dubbel with two notable exceptions. Firstly there was a definite added complexity, but the real surprise to me was the finish and the aftertaste. It was really quite dry, alcoholic and a very pronounced bitterness. It very strongly reminded me of a 1970's Guinness.

Well, the problem here is that the reputation goes before it. Here's my take.



Lovely deep orange color, small head and some lacing but not quite as good as I was expecting, nor as I had been led to believe. 



Aroma is very, very heavy on the floral hops - it's almost like a bathroom cleaner - it teeters on the edge of great and very ""iffy"". I didn't like it much. 



Taste is predominantly sweet. I was surprised because I was expecting hops to dominate but by far the main event in the mouth is a cloying, syrupy sweetness. In that respect I think this fails somewhat. It's funny because I love sweet beers, but I was shocked by the dominance of the sweetness ahead of the hops in terms of the taste.



Slight burn on the way down, and, guess what? A sweetness in the aftertaste!

I can see how many people will not like this at all - it certainly fills a certain niche - but for those that are partial to this type of beer and the style I think you'll enjoy it.

Highly drinakble with a nice orange peel bitter citrus finish. Not hop based but just dark enough to suggest a hint of smoke and dark winter days. A very nice beer that is highly drinkable AND has a nice alcohol kick - a nice combo.



Not as good, or as rich as Sam Adams Old Fezzy in my opinion, but of similar quality, and like that beer, it's a shame that this is not available in sixers as a winter seasonal as opposed to only being part of the mixed 12 pack. Come on BB, what about it?"

Taste has a very slightly acidic chocolate essence character. Definitely an artificial taste, but at the same time not unpleasant. Again, a small acid feel in the finish that is short with a tiny but of bitterness. A bittersweet ending.
Smooth and creamy in the mouth and very drinkable.
Nice, drinkable and worth a try, but at $14-$15 a bottle simply not very good value."

First time that I have opened a beer for a period of 24 hours before drinking; done it with wine before, but never with a beer.



Orange, clear, syrupy and viscous pour with a decent finger of tan head produced with an aggresive pour. Head disappears quickly and obviously there is no lacing.



Aromas are all sherry and alcohol, with deep alcohol soaked fruits. It drinks in the same manner with alcohol and sherry upfront, but in the finish it reminds you of its origins as a Barley Wine. A slightly dry, bitter ending rounds out the experience perfectly. Alcohol is there but it doesn't feel anywhere near the 11.5%.

2005 Vintage. Thanks go out to finewine mike for a chance to try this again.
Same vintage as the original reviews (below). Murky brown body with obviously no head or lace. Massive fig, dried fruit and raisin notes with (still) powerful alcohol. Very sweet and lots of oxidized notes. Very smooth and relatively easy drinking (considering).

2005 Vintage.
The Beast's reputation had gone before it - both good and bad, so I was nervous opening the 12oz bottle, with the neck and cap covered in red foil, with its label looking ominous. At close to $9 for the 12oz, I was also hoping for a result rather than a disappointment. I was delighted with what I found.
I strongly suggest pouring this into a small wine glass, and then sipping it slowly over a couple of hours. That will allow you to appreciate the beer in its full glory. I would even go as far to say that the 12 oz could be very happily split amongst two friends, the bomber might be enough for five!
Pure, deep orange with a tiny film on the surface. As still as a mill pond with a definite viscosity, this is designed to drunk late at night as a sipper - take your time with it.
Smell is perfect. A sugary, port and sherry like waft with depth, warmth and alcohol. The taste puts all of the aroma into action. Alcohol is certainly present, but is amazingly well hidden. Fruit soaked in, and laden with alcohol is the dominating taste, and the balance is delicious. Depth and warmth on the way down (slight burn) exudes class, this is one classy beer that sits in the mouth and goes down, as smooth as silk. Dates, figs and other luxurious and exotic candied fruits are present. Alcoholic plums?
I give it a 5 for drinkability, not because this is a quaffer, but because this is stunningly consumable considering the ABV and the kind of beer it is.
Don't be afraid of either the alcohol or the price, both are scary, but both are worth it."

$4.50 16oz Taco Mac, East West Connector, Austell, GA, USA.
Jet black pour with a tan/mocha head and a faint green tinge to it around the edges; a bit like algae on the surface of a stagnent pond! The head is not retained well and there is very little lacing. As usual this is served way too cold in most establishments and needs time to warm.
Some serious upfront bitterness with some prickly carbonation in the mouthfeel. The bitterness lingers, and although the mouthfeel is decent this most definitely not a smooth drinker.
Quite a pronounced, hoppy, bitter finish. Way out of line for the style.
I'm delighted that Sweetwater is trying this type of beer and I look forward to other experiments soon. The truth is, is that this is not a great beer, but it's a decent effort. It needs the edges taken off a bit."

Aroma is by far the strongest element here. Good, apparently authentic Belgian yeast smell, but it is quickly let down by the watery and weak taste. Mouthfeel follows along the same lines with an insipid effort and the drinkability is below average.



Has potential, and the possibility of being really something, but ultimately it fails. Much too thin and lacking in body."

Aggressive carbonation on the pour with a huge head forming in the tall, thin Pilsener glass that I chose. The lacing is impressive on top of the slightly cloudy, lemon body. 
Aroma gives off the earthy, organic notes that one would expect, and that is reflected in the taste too. Obviously very sharp tartness is the main feature, but there is a distinct yeast and wine like character too. Strange flat feel to the bottom of the glass considering the early ""fizz"".
Refreshing as long as you can put up with the tartness, and I can see why these beers are often blended to take the edge off. Pretty interesting and worth a try, but the style won't be for everyone.

Aroma is all plummy raisins with a depth of alcohol and tinge of fruit cake. A sherry like waft is included at the end too. Some port like notes as well, this is a tasty beast. Has a bit of a ""Coke"" feel about it, both in terms of the nose, appearance and sweet tastes.

There is a slight (and I mean slight) ginger aroma in the nose and a sweet lemony smell.
This is a thirst quencher alright, and if you are English this tastes almost identical to a basic bitter shandy. A combination of a classic English bitter plus British lemonade (Sprite, 7-Up).
I am a HUGE fan of DFH in general, and this beer will seem like a continuation of their ""envelope pushing"" to most American BA's, but the taste of a simple bitter shandy will be utterly inescapable for anyone from the UK.

Pour is an amazing looking black body with seriously SCARLET red highlights. These are NOT brownish/red highlights like many brews, these are truly bright, bright red in their color and really stunning. The head produce that lovely, creamy, spotty head and thick lace that one associates with the style. Very classy, very creamy.
The nose has plenty of the yeasty, dark fruits that one would associate with the style, and to be honest, although the beer is not what I would call ""hot"", the alcohol is still very prominent.

Delicious deep fruits, distinct Belgian yeasts and layers and layers of flowing flavors. Sugar, alcohol and yeast flavors all compete with one another but as with all quality brews they combine to produce a cascade of experiences, all dovetailing beautifully.

Great looking red pour with some head but it fades quickly. Obviously little or no persistent head or lacing.
Sweet cherry medicinal aromas with alcohol featuring prominently.
Tastes are sweet and alcoholic. An easy sipper that lacks a massive hop bite, and relies upon alcohol to take it into the parameters of the style.
Mouthfeel is slightly drying because of the ABV, but it strikes a good balance of syrup and texture.
All in all, very nice. It will disappoint those who are looking for a huge hop bite, but for those of us happy to enjoy an English style BW it hits the spot."

Presentation and name are obviously an attempt to make people think about their beer in the same way they think about their wine - that is, as a drink to pair with food. Now, although that is a noble goal in itself, the name and the bottle (it's a clear one) are just too contrived to take very seriously, and frankly make the beer look a bit silly. It's all compounded by being produced by a brewery that ought to know better, and the fact that despite appearances, this is a pretty decent drink.
Typical Euro, macro-lager pour with an ultra clear yellow body, decent carbonation but not much head, but a relatively surprisingly large amount of lacing.
Very soft, easy drinking, light and sweet in aroma and taste. Nice balance with a very small hop presence against the malt background.
Slightly better than average, I feel that it lacks something and I think it is a hop punch. It's actually close to being a really rather good beer, but the marketing angle is a bit of a mystery to me, and frankly it looks a bit daft."

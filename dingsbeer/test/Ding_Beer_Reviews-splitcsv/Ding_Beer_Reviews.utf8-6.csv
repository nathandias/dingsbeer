Amazing dark brown, ruby red highlighted beer, with a thick and bubbly head and some significant, sticky, persistent lacing.



Chocolate, smoky malts appear in the nose, and are intensified in the initial tastes. Alcohol begins to penetrate with a little bitterness, but the power of the sweet malts continue right through to end. Substantial mouthfeel, partly from the alcohol



Essentially this is an intense, high alcohol brown ale and it's delicious. At $6.99 for a sixer of 12 oz cans this is also exceptional value."

Absolutely crystal clear appearance, to the point of being clinical, golden, pale yellow color, small tight head with a minimal amount of lacing.
Hops dominate the smell, and I certainly agree that there is a pepper/spice/herbal note to them.
Some creaminess in the mouthfeel.
It drinks exactly as you would expect. Clean, bitter, hoppy and peppered. Some Saaz like bitterness in the finish and aftertaste too.
Good thirst quenching characteristics, but not eye-catching rather just a very solid example of the style. Often quoted as the quintessential example of an American version of the style, it's hard to argue with that opinion."

Deep golden yellow poured into the Trois Pistoles chalice. Small, but beautifully formed, dense white pillowy head, but the retention and the lacing are both below average.



Lots of banana, cloves and spice, but comes with an acidic edge too. In simple terms it drinks like a high alcohol Hefe, but at the same time is very, very reminiscent of a Duvel. That of course, is high praise indeed. Finishes with a slight grapefruit/citrus twang.

Pretty easy drinking beer condsidering it it categorized as a double IPA. Clear, orangey/copper pour with a nice looking ivory head and a little lacing. Nice balanced aroma with hops taking the lead but not grating.



The tastes were certainly citrus based, but not aggressive. A little dry in the finish, and the mouthfeel was slightly thin. Some good sweet fresh pine resinous hops which make for a very tasty brew.



Outside of that it drinks and performs like a quality, crafted IPA, but not like a huge hop bomb. Given the ""double"" moniker, I was expecting more in the hop department, but still enjoyed the simplicity of this brew."

This is an unbalanced beer with cutting, citrus hops overwhelming everything else, to the detriment of everything else.



Good looking beer, with a really nice color, lovely big fluffy head and some excellent layered lacing. The appearance is by far its best quality.



Mild hops in the nose, but this mild mannered start to the experience is quickly dispelled a thin mouthfeel, big, big hop profile and a brutally dry finish that saps the enjoyment from the beer.



(As an aside, I would MUCH prefer a beer called ""Santa's Private Reserve"" to be a seasonal, winter warmer style or spiced Christmas ale, rather than just a hugely hopped amber ale. To be fair, Rogue doesn't claim that this is anything but that, but it seems a bit silly to have such a style associated with such a name).

Pours very dark brown, almost black with a large head. Lacing is thick, sticky and copious.



Aroma is promising at first, but then a sharp cider smell wafts in and significantly subtracts from the aroma experience.



The taste masks the apple flavors, via the deep fruitcake and alcohol flavors that are upfront and delicious. It drinks much better than it smells. Large alcohol is obvious, and this is a rich beer. A little bit of bitterness in the finish but not much.

Dubbel like appearance, dark brown and a small head and little lacing, with sweetness of honey the power in the aroma. I didn't really pick up much coriander or orange in either the nose or the taste as advertised, but there was a sort of peppery twang in the finish. Alcohol at 9.00% is well hidden.

Nice deep brown appearance, but lack of head and lacing definitely detracts form the look. There was a little chocolate in there, but I didn't feel there was as much as some others have noted. The light drinking does mean that it has session possibilites, but frankly I would prefer a Brown that was more substantial.

Tastes are sweet malts. It's much sweeter than I was anticipating, and it drinks fairly sweet too. Small bitter finish with a tinge of hops, but not much to speak of. Smooth, nice mouthfeel.



Yes, this is an above average brew, and it IS a drinkable beer, but at the same time it seems very, very ordinary for a brewery that is so well thought of for its 20th anniversary beer. In that respect it is disappointing."

Mouthfeel is rather thin.

Great noisy pour, with a deep red/brown body, a delicious thick head, some lacing and a deep malty aroma. The mouthfeel is full and satisfying. The malts are the bulk of the taste with plenty of sweetness making up the initial tastes. Then comes the balance with a hop finish that is short and perfectly rounds the beer.



A little spice too (maybe some corriander?) and you have a super beer for winter's in by the fire. Lots of body and depth and he alcohol is very, very well hidden."

It's OK, but I can't imagine why this is classified as an English mild, it doesn't match ANY of my expectations for the style at all.
*(Subsequently changed in the BA database to an APA - I was RIGHT!)

Malty alcohol is a wonderful treat for the nose and this is the best part of the brew. This is followed up by the mixed fruit alcohol and then some really quite bitter hops in the finish. Actually quite metallic. Strangely pitched against the metallic hops is a cloying sweetness - a very odd combo!



This seems to drink way, way higher than the 4.40% ABV. It really seems like a hefty brew.

This is certainly a much hoppier version of the original (English) style and I think the beer suffers as a result. In Brown Ales I am looking for a sweet, malty smooth beer but the hop presence here gives it an edge that is not very welcome in the (original) style for me.



Original notes 1/22/06: (bottle)



Nice looking beer with good clarity and nice deep brown color - classic brown ale look. A small head and a little bit of lacing.



The classic looks are followed by a nice sweet aroma and then the usual sweet caramel characteristics of a quality brown ale. The finish is where things start to turn a little odd. A much shorter and drier finish than normally exected from a brown ale, and a much larger hop and alcohol profile than expected.



The hops give the beer a distinct American feel rather than a classic English feel. Most definitely a different beer from the original style."

Fairly pale orange body, with some nice carbonation, a huge head and some lovely lacing. It looks very inviting. Great body and very flavorful.



The malts are large, upfront and creamy. Perfectly rounded in the mouth and a slightly (very slightly) bitter finish.

12 oz bottle thanks to Penney for bringing this back from Bloomington. As before the hop based IPA character comes through and no way in the world would I guess that this is a APWA.
High head, golden body that looks like a macro lager or Pilsner. Aroma is a strong hop based one but the packaged is supported and held up wth the strong malts.
Very nice beer, but a bit odd in terms of its styling.

22 oz bomber.
This was really, really nice, but for some reasons that I was not expecting.
Golden pour, with a little cloudiness that looked more like chill haze than anything else. Nice persistent head, and some sticky lacing.
The aroma and the taste were simply very different to what I was expecting. It turned out to be a sweet, mildly hopped IPA type beer, more like an English IPA, and had some mild citrus notes, in particular orange and lemon.
Very tasty, rather unusual and very drinkable. A nice departure."

Taste is certainly alcohol based, but not as pronounced as many reviews have noted prior to mine. Actually this is very drinkable. the alcohol is obviously present, but I can really enjoy sipping it. Some floral notes in the taste too.

All the dark fruit aromas (plums and balck grapes) that one would expect from the style, but we get the additional smells of vanilla and deep, smooth alcohol thrown in. The sheer depth of this beer is immense, and coupled with the smoothness and taste this becomes an exceptional beer.



Warming on the way down, the alcohol is prominent but balanced and the sweetness is superb. Creamy mouthfeel tops off this great brew. By far the best beer that this brewer produces."

If this Brown Ale is anything to go by, things are no better, and I suspect we are at the point where things are unlikely to improve to any extent. They have now been open for a year, and to be honest we should be seeing some improvement - we're not. From conversations I had with employees, they certainly see food as the main source of income and the beer ""brewed"" on site is most definitely not the focus of this operation.



Back to the beer. Decent looking pint with good color, some head with nice retention, and some decent lacing, but that is where the good stuff ends.



The aroma is still very, very acidic with apples dominating the smell. Cider like aromas are very strong, and there remains the suspicion that their beers are infected.



Apple acid is carried forward into the taste, admittedly not as strong as in the aroma, but still the main feature.



Looking for the malty, deep body of a brown will be a pointless exercise here, as all we have is a weak, watery fluid with little or no taste.



There's no way I could get this down easily and certainly no way I would ever drink this in its current format ever again."

Bottle label has ""Seasonal : 2010"" in vertical text on the right hand side. Same ABV, same Jittery Joe's, same everything!
Pour is just as inky black as usual, but the nose and tastes remain VERY ""black coffee"" rich. One of the bigger nose and tastes that give a strong sense of coffee grinds - no doubt.
You've got to be in the mood for a coffee stout, but if you ARE, and you REALLY want coffee grinds, then this is for you. 
I wonder what this would be like with a healthy dose of coffee creamer and ice?!?! It wouldn't be beer anymore, but...

Original Review 01/06

I missed this on tap in a previous incarnation, so I am not making comparisons, just enjoying this exceptional brew.
Classic jet black, viscous pour with a darker than usual head (not so much tan as burnt tan). Some lacing but not a huge amount.
Aroma has a lot of the cereal, oatmeal feel rather than coffee and there is a distinct surprise that it is not a more potent, gripping nose.
The taste is incredibly smooth and the mouthfeel is full. Smoothness is reflected in the lack of coating this puts on the tongue. Without question, the most notable feature of this beer is the LACK of bitterness. Coffee based, double stouts can be notoriously bitter (for obvious reasons) but this drinks like a creamy and delicious classic, almost like an ironed out, creamy Porter
Some burnt and coffee notes, but these are distinctly in the background. Reminds me a lot of smoother version of Stoudt's Fat Dog.
Beautiful."

At this price, this beer is a straight 5. At $12, $13, $14 or $15 a bottle it isn't.



Great, butterscotch and lemon apppearance, with a massive head, chill haze, carbonation and a real viscous feel make up a wonderful look.



Aroma? Well, the best way I can describe it is as an expensive Euro Lager (Stella on acid). Hoppy and malty, and at the same time, the viscous feel seems to seep into the aroma?? I know that makes little sense but I get that feeling.



Syrupy, rich thickness dominates the taste, and this is unlike any Pilsner you will have drunk. In fact, there is an argument to say that the ""Imperialness"" of a Pilsner is just silly. It takes away the lightness and freshing drinkability of the style, and replaces it with a punishing brew that is great, but significantly removed from the original style. Sugary, alcoholic and smooth.



At $3.99 this unbeatable, at $17.00 at bottle it's a one-off purchase."

Aroma is the classic banana/clove combo, but at the same time there is a definite acidic quality. This acid carries through to the taste, to introduce a real unique quality to this beer, and making it a stand out its style. Delicious.

Poured into the Duvel tulip, there is an orange/golden body (looks a lot like lucozade) with a big frothy/rocky head but very little lacing to speak of. We get some spotty thin head left on the surface of the beer, and the Duvel tulip engraving continues produce bubbles of carbonation.



Yeast and peach/apricot are the overwhelming aromas - the peach/apricot is really strong and reminds me of an aromatic shower gel! I know this doesn't sound really nice, but it is not bad!



Taste is very, very, very floral. It's all flowers, with a tiny bit of sweetness and a very short, small, dry finish. It's so unusual it's the kind of thing you could serve as an aperitif in place of a light bodied wine, or indeed with a desert.



Drinkability is OK, but there is no way I could drink much of this since the flavor is a bit odd.

Up front tastes are sweet malts, with a little zesty bitterness, but not really much hop character.

Certainly some sweet malt taste, but it fades quickly to give a bland drink that didn't merit any further investigation. Perhaps nearer the source this would be better, but this did not travel well from Myrtle Beach down the coast to Hilton Head, SC.



Update: Came back to this in the same bar (Hinchey's on Hilton Head Island) six months later to give it another try. This time I got a better impression but it was still served way too cold and it took a good twenty minutes to get any significant aroma and taste out of it.

This gets better everytime I drink it. Even more smoothness than I remember, more rounded, more port like and sherry aftertastes, it gives me a warm glow inside. Delicious. Much darker pour that I remember in years past, and checking the review from a year ago that seems to be the case. Much better in 2006 and I have adjusted the scores accordingly. Really dark mahogony greets me this time. Lovely sweet malts in the nose. Less bitter too. 
I have bumped up one or two of the scores to reflect my new found devotion to this old friend.

Now in brown bottles with an updated shape & label.
Quite a light orange pour with some chill haze, not a great head and not much lacing either. All of these traits improve as the temperature increases. The appearance is somewhat disappointing, but luckily things get better when I drink the beer.
Some toffee malts in the nose. A surprisingly dryish hop taste compliments the malt backbone nicely. I get some bread notes too, like some fruit bread of some description, maybe even some banana.
Good mouthfeel, and a nice IPA type, lingering finish. Some soft brown sugar adds to the ""winter"" feel, but this doesn't have any spice character. Good body and a mild richness about the beer."

Corked and ""Clamped"" rather than Caged, 750 mL bottle.



This is a special beer indeed, that I simply classify as a great, ""Light Belgian Pale Ale"". By that I mean that if such a thing existed as a ""light"" Belgian, I beleive that this would be it.



HUGE, and I mean HUGE, frothy head, with massive retention and beautiful lacing against the backdrop of a orange/golden body.



Nose is honey sweetness that gets more intense as the temperature climbs.



Taste reflects the depth of a fruity Belgian Pale (yes I know this is French but there is a yeast component that seems to make this typically Belgian) against a massive drinkability that seems almost non-alcoholic in its ease of consumption. Don't get me wrong, the alcohol is there at 8.00% ABV, but it is shielded and delevoped by the sweetness and the rustic ambience.

It stimulates the taste buds from all angles. There is a very unexpected fruit backbone that compliments the sweet malts and the surprisingly hoppy ending character too. A long, long finish that takes you through the sense spectrum, and a decent alcohol kick that is more based in spirits than in beer. A little rum taste in there too.

Unsurprisingly, average in the extreme. Some fizzy carbonation out of the bottle, sort of had a caramel appearance, looking a lot like a Michelob Amber Bock pour. Carbonation was way too great, in fact a rather nasty, fizzy experience.



Any aroma was masked by the fact it was poured into a frosted mug, but after about ten minutes it began to release a little nutty character. After that, the tastes were of mild liquorice and some sweet malts. A little bitterness in the finish, but not hops, more of a metallic twang.

Aroma is excellent with a lot of sherry and rum like aromas. This is both a good and a bad thing. It's good because it smells delicious, but bad since it creates a mental picture of the taste that is richer, thicker and more complex than the mouthfeel, and ultimately the taste, delivers.



Taste is alcoholic liquor, that fades quickly in the rather thin mouthfeel to leave a medicinal or perhaps a vermouth type aftertaste. The finish is quite long, and it definitely levaves that herbal vermouth type taste - for those that remember a Cinzanno Bianco!

Typical pale orange pour, typical lack of sustainable head (cask characteristic) and typical organic grassiness in the nose. All coming together to complement one another, this is reminiscent of a Home Counties pub in more than one way. (Serious hint of nostalgia incorporated into the review).



As expected, there is a soapy, thin hop character that is so typical of these beers, but this is followed quickly by a serious malt assault, and a decent alcoholic twang. The alcohol seems bigger than the 6.50%, but perhaps that is because I wasn't expecting it in this beer.

This has the aroma of a classic Saison, perhaps is a little too dark but I can live with that, and gives a Saison taste for a few seconds and then guess what? Well, as is SO often the case, the over-hopping bitterness of Rogue cuts across and through absolutely every redeeming quality.
It simply does not work. A Saison is unlikely to be a brew that Rogue can pull off, and this confirms it. They appear to have attempted to combine a Saison with a winter, hopped beer and of course, the result is a mess.
Why the West Coast Hop kings would attempt this subtle style is beyond me.

Well past what Jim Koch recommends, but I wanted to experiment wih some age on this. Looks identical to ten months ago with great sticky lacing, and orange clouded body. From memory it appears that the hop profile has receeded alot (expected) but at the same time a strong grapefruit bitterness has replaced it. Almost as if a hop bitterness has been replaced by an acidic bitterness. Having said that, there is still a sweet alcohol presence and I still think this is very drinkable - not what it once was, but still drinkable.



Often I am sceptical of best before dates, and although that this beer certainly didn't go nasty at midnight on 01/31/06 it clearly hasn't benefitted much from time. Sometimes I like the way that intentionally hoppy beers fade over time to accentuate the malts but this is one seemed to lose a little - not much, just a little.



Original Review: 12/05



Nice. Double Pilsner? Well, I don't know about that, but it seems more like a Double IPA to me.



Huge hops all over the place, but tempered by some malt sweetness - very reminiscent of Stoudts Double IPA.



Thick, looking orange pour, with a large amount of cloudiness, a nice head and some excellent, viscous, sticky lacing. 



Hops and sweet malts are upfront and large, and essentially remove any characteristics that might put it into a classic Pilsner category. This has DIPA written all over it.



Drinks beautifully with the rare combo of masssive hops initially balanced by large malt sweetness in the finish. Some sticky sweetness finishes it off too.



A pretty big beer all around, with a very nice quality feel to it. This might be interesting to age a little."

Very light, almost dare I say it, macro lager like appearance, with some fairly aggressive carbonation. The carbonation is a little too much for me, and it leads to a rather thin body, mouthfeel and light, non-persistent head.



Definite Belgian yeast taste, but the ""Pale"" in Belgian Pale is really the dominant feature of this brew and it is surprisingly light and almost weak in taste and body. Nice finish that gives a fruity, dry taste, but by then the disappointment has already set in.

Attractive dark orange pour with a decent head but very little lacing. Slightly cloudy, that looks a lot like chill haze but isn't really.



Apple sourness in the nose and in the taste. The more I drink the more this reminds me of a classic framhouse scrumpy, but this is definitely more refined, more drinkable and smoother than the classic English country drink.

Aroma is a hop bomb, double IPA type with no hint of the malt sweetness that follows.



Super-sweet malts start this off, only to be balanced by an equally large burst of hops that come in the middle and the finish of this big BW. Sort of excess, followed by excess. A little peppery hoppiness in the finish. Quite a significant grapefruit bitterness too.

Taste is typically Rogue. Lots of hops upfront and all the way through to the finish. Grapefruit is dominant with metallic twang in the finish. Obviously this lacks the subtle notes that, say, an English ESB would impart, but then again it's not an English ESB so it's difficult to be too harsh.

Murky orange/brown hue reminiscent of cold tea, I'm afraid this did not score high on the appearance scale at all.



Aroma is of sweet fruits and deep seated sugar, but the fruits are not really very distinguishable - some candied pineapple perhaps, maybe some orange?



Mixed fruits are upfront in the taste too, then there is an alcoholic and (briefly) hoppy finish that is really very short. Finally some tart fruit cuts in at the very end.



Slick mouthfeel because of the alcohol and the sweetness, but the cloying sweetness seems to boast an ABV even higher than the advertised 8%.

Refreshing and drinkable.



This gets a very poor press here because, I suspect, that reviewers take exception to the fact that it has the Lambic label, which it clearly is not. Why BBC use the Lambic moniker is not clear to me since at best it is misleading, and at worst dishonest.

Got really lucky and managed to pick up four, single bottles at Macs in Atlanta. They had obviously split a few of the Winter packs and I am the lucky beneficiary! Hooray for me.
This year I get identical notes to that in 2007. The beer just isn't as sweet as it once was, and I like it a touch less than I used to. Seems as though there is more bitter, orange peel in the back end. I like that effect, but it comes across a touch more harsh than it has in the past. Of course, this COULD just be a palate change thing, but either way I still really, really, really enjoy this beer.
The clarity of the pour, the slightly off-colored head and the moreish element of this beer is exactly what I want and the beer delivers.
Still tasty, still one of favorite rituals every year. Super. Still desperately want this on its own, in sixers or larger format bottles. Pleeease!

Good looking, clear, dark amber/red pour with some decent head and some rather nice lacing. Great clarity.
Aroma has some ginger and spices. Body and mouthfeel is nice and full.
Taste is very nice with the advertised ginger, spices and orange well represented. A combination of sweetness upfront and a wonderfully biscuity, malty aftertaste. Delicious. A little bit of pleasing bitterness in the finish too. Malty backbone holds the whole thing together but it still gives a nice unexpected bitterness in the finish.
Highly drinkable and really ""moreish"".
I would love this to be available all year, but I suppose that would detract from its appeal a bit, but failing that it should SURELY be out in sixers or bombers as a seasonal rather than just in the holiday mixed 12?"

2007 Vintage. Bought this at GSO Wine Warehouse on a recent trip to Greensboro, NC, USA. $4.49 for the 22 oz bottle, purchased on the day of release. I resisted the temptation to buy the larger, flip top growler type bottle since I remembered not being that impressed with this beer the first time around in 2005 (last year I didn't buy it at all). I was surprised to read my review form 2005 and see that it almost EXACTLY applies to this vintage. It's a decent beer, but to me it is simply not that impressive - fails to live up to the hype for me; maybe I need to try this on draught.

22 oz bottle. Greens on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA. 2005 Vintage.
Red pour, thin looking, not much head and very little lacing. Some bubbles, but distinct lack of head-carbonation results.

I get some initial bitterness but this fades quickly to yield some some sweetness and spice. The spice is difficult to place, maybe some vanilla? A little chocolately/very mild coffee note too.

I was a bit dubious of this being classified as a brown ale with the relatively high ABV, since to me one of the more characteristic traits of a great brown ale is likely to be its mild, easy drinking nature.

Alcohol is prominent in the nose too.



Very smooth drinking and a nice, full mouthfeel. More and more nuttiness in the finish as it warms.

Got a chance to revisit this at The Brick Store - thanks to Simon for the sample. Rumor has it that this vintage topped out at around 24%!
Great legs in the glass, silky smooth and chocked FULL of flavor. About one-third of a 12oz bottle is enough for me. Remains very wine/port like with immense presence.

Ink black pour, an initial decent head that of course fades to reveal a very small amount of lacing, but still some thin, spotty film remains. Darkly mysterious!
Aroma is wine like, with alcohol prevelant and a lot of sweetness. Some chocolate notes too.
The aroma is reflected in the tastes. Massive alcohol, prunes, other dark fruits and sugary sweetness. This is truly a big beer.
Mouthfeel is smooth but gives a lovely warming sensation in the finish.
Amazingly drinkable considering the style and the alcohol.

Pretty malty, sweet drinking, with a smooth nutty ""character"" rather than a nutty taste. In classic Rogue fashion, the beer ends with a hop bite. Not the usual, massive over the top hop assault that has put me off so many Rogue products, but still noticebale and still enough to make me think that it slightly pushes it out of the style.



As it warms it smooths out a little, to give a very slightly nuttier feel, but with this comes a bit more acid in the finish.



A strange mish-mash of flavors that, in the end, sort of work well together to produce a very drinkable, somewhat quirky version of the style."

Corked and caged ""ceramic"" bottle. Poured into a St. Bernardus chalice I get a very deep brown mahogany body and an initially large head that fades pretty quickly. The head falls back to give a modest, but very attractive thin, spotty, creamy film across the large expanse of the surface. Each sip pulls some lacing up the side of the glass and reveals its true character - an immensley fine carbonation, with incredibly small bubbles and a frothy, fine texture. Very, very attractive.



Standard fruit esters make up the bulk of the aroma, but they are not overwhelming, in fact rather understated.



Mouthfeel increases in depth as in warms. In terms of the taste the finish is dry and long and leaves a little hop bitterness. A tiny bit a citrus at the very end. As the warms it rounds a little to bring the tastes to the fore. Frankly it's quite dry and lacks the really rich fruit depth that one might expect from the style. Reminds me much more of a Dubbel that anything else.

Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side and shys away from the slick, thick sweetness that a typical Tripel would have.



This is a drinkable and nice ""everyday"" Belgian, but I don't think it is very faithful to the Tripel moniker. In fact it is much, much more like a Dubbel than anything else. Lacks the sweet, slick, alcoholic feel of a Tripel and therefore loses some style points.

Cellared Review 09/09

Well, 4+ years on this beer, time to crack one open. 
Firstly the pop on opening gave an indication of things to come. It was small, and although not completely dead it was disappointingly slight. I was anticipating some drop in carbonation, but this was disappointing. 
The pour gave the Dubbel-like appearance that I was expecting but again it lacked life.
LOTS of sherry, oxidized notes which is fine by me for two reasons; firstly I was expecting it, and secondly I like this trait in a cellared beer. As I drank it the beer came a little more into its aged, oxidized self; extra plum, raisin and fig notes but all accompanied by the musty nature of an older beer and the lack of pop that the carbonation WOULD have provided.
All in all pretty UNsurprising but satisfying. The beer had lost the obvious things, gained the obvious things and considering that the beer was NOT my favorite Unibroue to start with I don't feel too let down.

Original review 10/05

Dark, dark brown which, in less than perfect light, almost looks black. Nice head from the initial pour that was really highly carbonated. This settles down to give a nice thin, creamy spotty film, but not a great deal of lacing.
Fruity alcohol with an edge makes up the largely ester-based nose. 
Farily thin in the mouth (I was expecting much more depth), and there is some harsh acidity and carbonation. Alcohol bites at the end, but smooths out in the aftertaste with some seriously alcoholic based fruits (perhaps plum?).
It's a little harsh, by that I mean it lacks smoothness and roundness. A bit edgey for my liking, but still a good quality beer.
This was slightly disappointing which I think says a lot about Unibroue in general. When drinking one of the special editions you are looking for a really stunning brew - instead we get a good brew! That's the standard that this brewery has set and that's a good thing.
Definitely worth checking out, but not the best from this generally excellent brewer."

Thick and noisy, bright copper colored pour with a good head that dies quickly due to the 11% ABV. The lacing is obviously minimal.
Very sweet malts in the nose and not much else, except sugar coated sugar!
There are some very big hops in the finish but they are not remotely bitter. They simply serve to even out a beer that would otherwise be simply too much to handle in terms of malt sweetness and alcohol.
There is a little whisky character in the finish as well.
Obviously a sipper, but a very, very drinkable high ABV Barleywine. Unusually smooth and drinkable for the style, in fact so much so I gave it a 5. It's big in the mouth but at the same time not overpowering."

My experience with American Barleywines has been a bit hit and miss with some just being too much. I have come to the conclusion that I have to drink sweeter, malt based BW's rather than the hop based ones.

Everything about the aroma and taste is malt based. It's not remotely sweet, but the malts serve to smooth out the beer to such an extent it becomes a little on the bland side. Don't get me wrong, I like it, but it is a very laid back beer that will not suit the palate of someone needing a malt or hop jolt.



Some dry and bitter hops arrive in the very short finish, but these seems slightly out of place against the majority of the drink being so smooth and malt based. The bitter aftertaste is also really surprising for such a malty beer and is a bit of a shock to the tastebuds - not in a harsh way, it just seems a bit odd.



A little thin in the mouth, but still smooth, this is typical of a UK style, mild tasting bitter, but still a long way from the best that you can find in this group, even in the USA.

Not a great deal of Oktoberfest character here, drinks more like an APA to me. Having said that I quite like it, just not as full of (Oktoberfest) character as I was expecting."

As in warms there is a little more malt character, but it fails to quell the immensely bitter profile.



Mouhtfeel suffers from the acute harshness of the hops and its drinkability obviously goes down too.

Delighted to find a bottle of this marked down from $6.49 to $3.99. Why not take a chance?
Carbonation is still great which was my first worry. Nice lace.
The beer still drinks with a degree of peppery harshness, AND reamins bitter just like four years agao, AND remains at the edge of the Saison category, but now it has developed a real, distinct and delicious lemon note.
Light spice, light acid and a touch of funk, it finishes with herbal sweetness.
Delicious, this has definitely benefitted over time for me. Scores adjusted accordingly.

Very good looker, a lovely golden yellow color with a nice, if not huge head that lingers a little and gives some lacing. Not enough head for the style, I look for really white and billowing head.
Aroma is muted bananas and pronounced cloves.
There is some real (and unexpected) quite severe bitterness about this. It seems out of style and out of character.
Mouthfeel is OK, but the bitterness creeps into the finish and creates a bit of an edge.
Drinkability is lowered by the bitterness and subtracts from the ""enjoyability"".
Not a bad beer, but not a great saison."

Well, essentially this is a Madeira Port posing as beer. When I smelled this and then drank it, I could think of nothing else.
It's huge in all respects. Alcohol is warming and then burning, the deep and dense liquor smell is absolutely immense, and it drinks like a port. Hugely rich and although not difficult to drink, one is plenty for me in most sitting, settings. A ""one-bottle sipper"" in my opinion.

Original Review 09/05

Nice presentation in the large 750 mL green bottle with the corked, caged and gold foiled top. Quite champagne like in its external appearance.
Aroma is a little spice, but mainly alcohol. Very typical for the style and for a Belgian in general.
Pours with that classic golden yellow pour, a rocky head and a lot of excellent lacing. This is typically Belgian Tripel, with the distinctive yeast taste, the warm and high alcohol feel, and the mild spice. As it warms the spice becomes increasingly apparent.
Carbonation is very nice, but the mouthfeel is slightly below excellent (only just), but does have a reassuring slickness as it warms. The bottom-scored Duvel tulip helps the retention of the thin filmed head.
In fact, this benefits as it warms in more than one way.

It really is quite bitter all the way through the finish, and although it doesn't overpower the beer as a whole, there is a distinct lack of malt presence.



If you like a bitter IPA, with a large hop flavor, but one that is less rounded and full in the mouth than many similar large American IPA's, then you'd enjoy this beer a great deal. Avery Maharaja is an example of a similar, big IPA that drinks ""fuller"" than this."

Golden pour with very little head but some nice lacing.



Yeasty apples in the aroma.



Very sweet, yeast based taste (that typical Belgian taste) with an awful lot of sweetness and sugar with some fruits. A tiny bit of spice in there too, but this is overtaken by the candied suagared sticky stuff.



Not sure how this really fits into the authentic Tripel style, but it is a drinkable beer. What I don't like is the distinct apple taste that comes through really strong - in fact to such an extent it begins to taste more like cider.



Tiny hop bite in the finish, but this is quickly overrun by the sweetness. Alcohol is well hidden.

As it warms it gets sweeter and sweeter.



Head and lacing are excellent, it looks great, it tastres great, it IS great.



IPA fan? Double IPA fan? Hophead? Any of the above, you'll love it, as long as you can cope with the sweetness. I love the sweet side of things so it's not a problem for me, but some will find it a little too much I suspect. Big beer - big hit."

I have no problems with bottle-conditioned and unfiltered beers, but when we get to this level of debris swirling around in the glass it really doesn't look at all appetizing. The troubling thing is that the level of carbonation coupled with the size and amount of sediment combine to give a real nasty looking mess in the glass that almost seems to be alive! Huge carbonation on the pour that strangely faded to leave no head or lacing. What's up with that?



Somewhat of an acidic type aroma in there, with only a little rye. Some smokiness in there too which is replicated in the initial tastes.



Pretty light body with a definite citrus lemon twang. Quite a sharp finish but not much bitterness.

As a poor student who knew better, but would often have to drink low quality macro's at 4-5% ABV, the opportunity to quaff something nearly twice the ABV was always an enjoyable one. Also enjoyed rinking Giraffe at the time too! I seem to remember an earlier incarnation of this beer being sold in England in the late '80's as being higher than the now advertised 7.2 ABV. Anyone know?



Anyway, I digress, back to the beer.



Desperately disappointing on revisiting this. A bland macro type lager with only a few redeeming features. Not skunky, very malty, good ABV and a tiny hop bite in the finish. Outside of that nothing that a BMC couldn't deliver."

Of course, that's where the story begins and ends, but this does do well when compared to others of its type, especially in the Light/Lite category.

Subtle and well crafted beer, a rare combination.



Some mild hop bitterness all the way through the drink. This has great potential as a session beer.

Tastes are certainly malt based, but they are fairly reserved. Lots of sweetness but this is tempered by the lack of body.

However, it drinks fairly clean, lacks any nasty skunk, and can be refreshing when the heat of Atlanta gets to its most intense. Outside of that we have nothing here other than what you would expect. Neutral aroma, taste and character."

Malt dominates the taste (of course), good alcohol too and some ripe round fruits, mainly plums. Candied sugar is there too.



Mouthfeel is slightly under-par for a Doppelbock (a little thin), but that did not significantly detract from the enjoyment. High drinkability for the malt lover, a very nice offering.

What lacing is produced is sticky. Aroma is not the huge hop bomb that you may think, in fact it's quite sweet.
A lot of bitterness in the large hop profile, but it's perfectly balanced in the beer. One of the few examples of a very large beer that is wonderfully crafted with grace and skill.
A little bit of pine, a little bit of citrus, a little bit of oily hop presence are all there in the tastes, but they all mesh with one another perfectly; nothing is overpowering and they meld together to produce a richness and a drinkability seldom found in a beer with this kind of hop-profile and size. Sweetness comes through again, as does that distinct DFH character which for me at least, is some kind of unique hop and yeast combo - difficult to put my finger on it but definitely very obviously DFH.
Mouthfeel is close to perfect, with lots of tingling hop character, some dryness and a malt backbone completing the experience and holding up the hops nicely.

Dark brown pour, but not so deep that a real deep mahogany type body was evident, with nice spotty lacing on the surface of the beer and on the glass.



A lot of malt and spice in the aroma. Detected some orange peel (as advertised), but the others were more difficult to detect and definitely not as deep and rich as some other Belgians of the same ilk - a little more reserved here, with the emphasis on the spice rather than the fruit.



Bitter, dry finish with a OK mouthfeel, but again, not as full as some others. Alcohol is well masked until the end when it bites pretty hard.



This is a slightly different feel for a Belgian dark and I prefer the fruitier, richer versions to the spiced. However, still very nice and very drinkable and definitely a good beer."

I'm assuming that this is what the ""brewer"" is trying to achieve. It must be quite difficult to do if you are starting with malt and hops. My question is, ""Are they starting with malt and hops??""



Extremely pale yellow color, with zero head after the first 25 seconds. Certainly very cold, and would be most welcome after several hours of herding livestock in the desert, but outside of that scenario I see no point in consuming it. I assume that there are quite literally millions of people that consume this on a regular basis in the USA alone, what any of those people would think of a beer with ANY kind of taste is really alarming.

This is very sweet, with a very short bitter snap of a finish that does not linger at all, but leaves behind the residue sweetness. Obviously the sweetness and the bitterness appear to owe nothing to malt or hops, and there is a distinct feeling of a manufactured beer taste. Lacing? Well if you call a nasty sticky residue that almost etches the glass lacing, then yes there is a little.
Mouthfeel not as clean as some macros because of the sweetness that is present.
Some dry cider tastes linger in the mouth after consumption.

I was pleased to find that this wasn't mega-complex. That may sound strange to some, but I was glad that the beer really was simply a really nice, strong stout. Sometimes brewers get into the habit of trying to produce something that is way too complicated, this didn't.



Smoothness and strength are the key descriptors here. There are a lot of burned malts which are layered on top with the alcohol and some sweetness, but that disappears quickly to give a bitter, but short finish.



Mouthfeel is good, with a little pricky carbonation to add to the experience and some warming qualities in the mouth.

Light amber, crystal clear pour with a nice head that disappears quickly to leave a spotty, creamy reminder. I don't pick up any really distinct aroma other than the obvious alcohol and general fruitiness of the esters.
It is sweet, but there is also a distinct ""Belgianness"" about this beer, perhaps due to the types of yeasts used. Considering the ABV this has a very light mouthfeel. There is a bitter, hoppy, sharp, high alcohol finish, the hoppiness of which surprised me.
There is definitely a higher hop character than one would expect in a ""Belgian, Belgian"", but this beer pulls off an interesting hybrid between the higher hopped American styles and the authentic European interpretation of a Quad.

Typical AMERICAN Barley Wine, and I increasingly feel, that when you get to this level of ABV it can start to get difficult (even for an excellent brewer like Stone) to start making distinguishing charateristics.



Lots of warming alcohol in the taste, you can feel it going down, but outside of that not a huge amount to distinguish it from lots of other good quality BW's.



Yes, it's an excellent example, but not a stunner. Good hop character that hangs well against the alcohol and the sweetness, in fact rather well balanced, but of course, it's a sipper more than anything else.



Good, slightly oily, slick mouthfeel but drinkability is not huge, largely because of the the alcohol and the style."

This is classically Belgian dark in that it gives layer after layer of dark, alcoholic fruit overtones in the nose and the taste, and ends with a sharp alcohol bite that only really comes out of beers from this country. I love the deep satisfying body of this beer and its ability to let you know that you are drinking something serious. Plums and other very ripe fruits dominate, but in places it appears as if the fruits have gone a little too far in their maturation process - there's a little bit of rotting vegetation in there and some stench around the edges of the aroma.
Then there is the appearance! WOW. On the second pouring huge globules of God knows what fall into the glass. I'm a pretty experienced drinker and I've seen all kinds of yeast based sediment fall into beer before - usually enhancing the appearance and the taste of a brew - but this truly looked utterly disgusting. The only way I could accurately describe it was that it looked like hundreds of small pieces of soggy toilet tissue! The beer literally took on the appearance of something that had failed to flush a couple of times! NASTY. The odd thing was, the beer seemed almost alive, with the sediment refusing to settle for about fifteen minutes. When it had settled, any small agitation - like trying to drink it - caused this amazing circulation of solids that was truly disgusting.
The first glass from the 750 mL bottle was only slightly affected by this problem, the second was nearly impossible to consume. Eventually I gave up with it.
Now, I don't know what that stuff was - it certainly wasn't normal yeast type sediment as I have experienced it in the past, and perhaps something odd had occurred in the bottle - but it took the beer from being a great one to something that simply confused me. Most probably coagulated proteins."

Deep fruitiness and malt backbone really belies the fact that this is both a Barley Wine and a hoppy one at that. It's really a complex beer with the hoppiness, alcohol, malts and fruit all complimenting one another in layered rushes.



Just when you think that you've got a handle on where this beer lies in the style range, it's up and at you from a different angle. Refreshing, then biting, then fruity, then dry, then intense, then soft malts, the list goes on.

Refreshing, tasty and satisfying, this stuff slips down with an alarming ease. The alcohol is obviously there, but compliments the rest of the attributes perfectly to produce a beer that is getting close to perfection.



Mouthfeel is superb, with the cold hops mingling on the tongue with the fruitiness of the malt to give a drinkability that is very, very good. Alcohol can creep up on you here which is typical of a beer that is so drinkable.

Classic orange marmalade and hazy pour, with lovely light head and some sticky lacing. Aroma and initial tastes are obviously West Coast hops, but they are loose and not overpowering. Plenty of swwetness in the nose too, and the floral character of the hops and the sugar sweetness combine to make this a real stunner.



A beer that has the confidence to say, ""Yes I have plenty of hop character, but I have the strength to hold my own without becoming gimmicky.""



Lovely citrus refreshment, but it's light and crisp at the same time to give this a drinkability akin to a Pilsner in high summer. Finishes bitter, but short and sweet, not burning. A little light pineapple in the finish. Alcohol is hardly to anywhere to be seen. This drinks much light than 6.90%.



Fantastic, delicious and a great, great example of how to brew beer with serious hop character and bitterness, but backed up by strong malts in a subtle way. Stone rocks!"

I found this a little too light and under-spiced for the style. With that slight insipid character came some acidity that took points away from taste and drinkability. Light cloves and lemon are there, but not in way that gives the refreshing character that I was looking for.



Despite not being the best Wit, it still holds up pretty well in the grand scheme of things, and like most Unibroue products it represents excellent value and a solid, if not spectacular choice.

Lots of chocolate and coffee in the tastes, but the main taste is the lingering licorice finish. Quite smooth until the end when the bitter finish kicks in.



Alcohol is very well hidden, but the beer is clearly large. I was surprised at the relative thin mouthfeel and the lack of tongue coating that I got.

I was rather surprised at the citrus notes being so prominent, especially the grapefruit overtones. The grapefruit was pronounced and had the effect of making the beer very crisp and refreshing.



Body was lighter than I was anticipating, and mouthfeel was light and dry. The finish was short, but hoppy. Hops are unusually up front for the style.

In the end it resembled some kind of weird hybrid of cider, saison, wit and hefe, and was just about as far removed from the Pilsner label that the brewer had put on it that you could imagine.



Watery mouthfeel, and a lingering acidicly bitter aftertaste. Not good.



To be fair this is the very first offering from the brewpub and, given time maybe things will improve. I am happy to wait and see, but this was a pretty bad start."

Alarmingly like the Carrollton Ale (http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/11659/24834/?ba=Ding) this beer also has a strong apple/acid aroma and taste. However the Summer Wallop does have some redeeming malt backbone which makes it slightly more drinkable and adds sweetness.



Drab brown color, with a lack of clarity, this is not an attractive pint, but it does have potential. Mouthfeel was average, but on closer inspection the body was missing and it was hardly in the brown ale category, let alone the stouts.



This brewpub clearly is at the beginning of a very long road, but the very fact that it exists at all in this part of the world is a minor miracle. I hope things improve, and this beer has the potential to be at least a decent staple. It's not there yet, but I shall continue to monitor progress."

I prefer my Porters to exhibit a mild, creamy overall experience with a classic black appearance and a smooth texture. The appearance criteria are nicely fulfilled by this brew - a jet black body, small tan head with a little lacing, but that's where the Porter style is left behind and the beer then departs on some wild hop extravaganza. Fine if you like beers that get hopped out of the style, but less appealing if you are looking for a classic.
No doubt that this is an interesting brew - a hopped up, supercharged Porter - but as is so often the case when classic styles and beers are treated this way, a lot of the original charm, sophistication and intent are lost. Shame really, because this *could* be an amazing Porter in the true sense of the style, but it falls into the mega-beer trap.
Alcohol is too large for the beer, but having said that quite well hidden. Bitterness abounds, and that's not what I'm looking for here."

The coffee taste totally takes over any hop bitterness to such an extent that the sweetness that I assume is coming from the malt backbone, just tastes like sugar.

Carbonation is also a little high. This is a sweet malty beer, especially in the long finish and there is plenty of chocolate in there too. These facets are present in both the aroma and in the taste. Lack of real hop bitterness coming through, again takes it a little out of style.

This is easy to review. I suppose this stuff must have been brewed as ""beer"", but the chili overwhelms everything, to make it essentially alcoholic water with tabasco sauce added. No point in discussing head, color, lacing, aroma, mouthfeel etc. as there are no characteristics other than the burning heat of the chili pepper sitting in the urine colored liquid.

Unattractive label, but attractive beer. Deep brown with a good head. Some slight smoke in the aroma.

This is really a bitter hop based IPA with little or no balance from malt.

Stinging acid grapefruit twang is the overwhelming taste sensation and this simply doesn't give way. I suppose this is what the brewer is trying to achieve, but I think it's at the expense of other aspects that should feature a little more in the style.

Original Review 06/05

Deep orange pour with an impressive looking head and plenty of lacing. Orange color is reminiscent of a rich IPA, but this drinks much lighter and more refreshing. Attractive looking pint.
Aromas are of some buttery type malts, and a lovely balance of bitterness compliments the soft touch that they provide.
Very smooth, and delicious in the mouth, a really good beer to sit down and enjoy a session with even though it's NOT a session beer! Finishes gently, leaving you wanting more.
This is highly drinkable and I think it would appeal across the board, with solid BA's, newbies, ladies, on its own or with food. A very nice cross-over beer with lots of potential to be enjoyed in many different venues."

If you were brought up like I was, in an area of England renowned for its cider production, then this will remind you very much of a dry, genuine ""scrumpy"" farmhouse cider. The only difference being the dark mahogany colored body, and the slightly less crisp feel that you would associate with those rural ciders. 
Small head that quickly disappears, this beer is not really something you are going to drink much of, more a mood beer, or perhaps something good for a thirst quenching moment. Color and deep body are attractive, with a sour twang and associated apple aromas. Light vinegar and sweet and sour notes blend perfectly to produce a delicate and striking beer. 
Mouthfeel is fruit like, but lacks the crispness of a cider.
Definitely an odd ball from the usual range of tastes and beer experiences, but much, much easier to drink than the related(?), pure Lambic style. Worth a try, but certainly won't be to everyone's taste."

If you like massive beers you won't care for this much, if you like subtley crafted, drinkable beers you probably will.



Excellent potential for sessions, as the ABV and the tastes are both muted and mild. Nice, I'll be back again."

2009 vintage.
The beer exudes a reddish brown hue with the classic, spotty, cream lace that sits atop the body. Appearance bumped by 0.5 from the original review.
Alcohol remains a feature here, but the beer gives up more marzipan than I remember on earlier vintages. Slightly drier finish than in the past too, but all of the usual, normal features are there.
In short it's a classic and stands out for me.

2004 Vintage. Apart from the appearance, it's perfect.
The aroma, taste and mouthfeel are simply densely scrumptious. It's a combination of plums, dates, figs, sultanas and alcohol, wrapped inside a coffee bomb, wrapped inside a malt monster! 100% chocked full of alcohol, fruit and taste, this is a huge beer.
It's full, it's rounded, and it's an attack on the senses. The appearance lets it down a little, with a slightly brown rather than the expected deep black color that would match the taste and smell. Not much to complain about though, it's a ""stunna""!"

Much sweeter than I remember before bothering to take notes and review, with a lack of bitterness and lack of alcohol edge until the very, very end. Smooth (not nitro smooth obviously) but nevertheless very easy drinking.



Mouthfeel hits the exact right tone with me, with creaminess, edge and bitterness all coming together to give a magnificently rounded experience.

Disappointing looking beer with a dank, light brown appearance that looks murky and fairly unattractive. No head to speak of.

Plenty of ginger in the nose and a little in the taste, the beer only really succeeded in being slightly sour and rather acidic.



An orange pour with no head to speak of, its appeal was lost fairly quickly as the acidity overpowered the ginger, and the beer was lost.

A lot more drinkable on draught - $4.25 for the 16oz pour at Taco Mac, Douglasville, GA, USA.
Thin, pale color with some lace, but the head is very wispy and has no depth.
Simple, light caramel sweetness and refreshing. Not much to report here, but significantly better on tap han in the bottle for me.

I didn't care for this much.
Elaborate description of the beer on the rear label - I like that, but it compared itself to Bass that I think is a stretch.
Hazy orange with a large head following an aggresive pour, but the head fades fast to leave a somewhat flat looking beer.
Aroma - I didn't get much, it may be that I was drinking it too cold, but even on warming that didn't change much.
Taste - very bitter. Not in a good way either. It wasn't a hop bitterness, rather a slightly sour, acidic taste.
Body was thin and weak that led to a thin mouthfeel. I won't be in a hurry to go back to this."

Pretty standard appearance for a decent Wit, with the anticipated lemon, cloudy hue and a large billowing, white head. Looks good, although the lacing and the head retention are not up to much.



I didn't get the large citrus nose that some others have noted, in fact, the whole aroma and taste experience was rather subdued. Not the most potent Wit in a style that is seldom very gregarious. Good mouthfeel, and drinkability.

Golden hue, but huge amounts of nasty looking yeasty sediment still entered the glass despite the careful pour. Not good looking stuff either, it sort of half floated, half sank, quite unappetizing. A bit thin, a bit too orange orverall. Head was not thick enough, and was lost way too soon and was really quite poor. No billowing creamy dense white head that I have come to expect from this style.



Sweetness (not in a good way) dominated the beer. Alcohol and dry ending that should have been present were just not there in sufficient or lingering enough quantities. No spice at all detected.



Thin, sugary mouthfeel, not good.



Poor Tripel in my opinion, very surprising for this consistently good brewery. However, good enough to be decently drinkable."

Pours a very attractive golden color - so far so good in relation to the name - but gave a pretty small head that I only managaed to invigorate by constantly topping up from the bottle into my pint glass.



Some grass in the aroma (was that my imagination thinking Organic?) and a nice creamy mouthfeel.

Very nice looking pour, with a distinctly amber body and a full, lingering head with some nice lacing. This is a good looking beer.

Very poor head as well, which I think was due to the hopeless pour and general non-attention given to presenting the beer at the bar I was drinking at. However having poured this for myself at home subsequently, I aslo found the head fading very quickly to almost nothing, and there is certainly no lacing apparent.
Outside of the appearance, the standard malty banana and clove overtones with lots of background sweetness and a drier than expected yeast finish. Quite a surprising amount of alcohol present as well.

Had to come back with some additional notes on this great beer now it has reached GA. It remains VERY sweet and that's really why I love it.

Pours a pale golden with a small, frothy bone-white head and some significant lacing.
I was very surpised at the upfront, malty sweetness of this. I was expecting a more in your face hop-bomb, but was delighted with the deliciously different beer that was in front of me.
Very creamy texture due to the carbonation and the sweetness, the hops really didn't kick in right until the very end of the finish. Some dryness and a little bitter hop kick in the dregs of each mouthful, but all in all the hops are very surprisingly subdued. I liked that, I wonder if others will be disappointed that a DIPA is not more upfront with the ""in the face"" hops?

Drab, brown pour with a large amount of (presumabley) yeast floaties. Alcoholic warmth seems very high for such a relatively low ABV. Taste has the malts with little hop character, but they are not the warm toasted malts that the nose suggests, rather a sugary sweet then sucrose solution.

Definite relationship between the orange looking body, the taste and the label, all of which pull together a distinct citrus feel and an amazingly refreshing drink. large amount of unfiltered sediment, but not dark. Odd, but this is a beer that I am going to drink exclusively in the daylight! Sounds odd I know, but this is a definite backyard, deck and grilling classic already.  Like others have said, the spiced coriander is muted, and the citrus tones are what one remembers. Lovely carbonated mouthfeel that benefits from a level of chilling that I don't generally approve of. A summer classic in the making."

Mouthfeel was oily and syrupy like a Barleywine. I think I may have been deceived by the beer since I drank a really light, but hoppy IPA just prior to this. The first one was light and refreshing, this one came down as being really robust and quite harsh in (perhaps unfair) comparison.

Interesting - not a real clean tasting beer, lots of action going on. Some good, some bad.



Good looking golden body, but distict lack of head was disappointing, especially in the wake of what appeared to be some lively carbonation. As others have observed, a certain amount of ""flatness"" to the beer. Aroma's are very low key, some alcohol and little else especially distinguishable.



Goes down real easy, but there is a slight chemical feel to the brew. A bit of an aftertaste that is difficult to place, perhaps metallic, perhaps hoppy, I'm not sure.

Light amber pour with a small head. Disapates soon with some limited lacing. Some citrus (possibly) orange in the nose. Very mild hops and not much malt.



This is a low impact beer, and I suspect that for that reason it may not be especially popular in the USA. On the other hand I bet it scores highly in the UK. Because of the mild categorization this has huge potential as a session beer.



Relatively thin in the mouth (on purpose) with a mildly bitter and dryish finish. Slightly metallic but not in an unpleasant way, that just seems to add to the cleanliness of the beer as a whole.

The more I reflect on this, the more I like it and the better it gets with warmth. Very important to let this warm in the glass for 30 minutes IMO. Complexity and flavor dramatically increase in that period, and I see the notes I am used to shine through. Delicious.

Original Review 04/05
===
A pretty good example of how persistence and an open mind can have their rewards.
Having tried the ""6"" and the ""8"" (neither of which I was especially excited about), I pressed on in the the hope that the ""10"" would be better. I was delighted to find that it was. I was a little worried that the even higher ABV and the higher price, would lead to something even less balanced and even worse value for money than its two smaller brothers. It didn't - I was pleased.
Same rather drab appearance. I think I suffer from having this given to me when it is simply too cold. This has the effect of creating a lot of condensation of the outside of the glass (in this case a St. Bernardus chalice) which simply adds to the murkiness of the the already murky brew. To be honest this is not a great beer to look at.
Aroma is muted and not as alcoholic as I expected. Certainly lots of dark fruits, but the potency I was half-expecting to overpower the beer, was, happily, not present. Aggressive pour led to a nice head, but as I let in warm a little to release those flavors and aromas, this quickly became a spotty, creamy film.
Delicious balance here. Warming alcohol certainly, but the seemingly potentially dangerously overpowering 11.3% ABV is nowhere to be seen. This drinks *way* below that number. Definitely benefits from a little time in the glass from two angles; as it warms the carbonation seems to die down and secondly it smooths out a bit.
Beautiful creaminess in the mouth and a rich finish that is difficult to match - even amongst other top quality Belgians.
""6"" and ""8"" hold little interest for me - mainly due to their poor value for money - ""10"" is a different matter. Spectacular."

Having said that, this is no worse an offender than scores of similar others, but what really irks me is the fact that this is clearly a child of marketing strategy rather than the art of brewing. Ho hum, another example of capitalist America pandering to the masses.



Budweiser Select is certainly a ""clean"" beer. That is definitely on its side, but of course with the excessive crispness and cleanliness comes an almost complete lack of ANY other defining characteristics.



I see a pale, piss colored liquid, over carbonated and with zero head retention beyond maybe 5 seconds (I'm always confused with lots of fizzy bubbles and no head). It's aroma is non-existent (1.0 here means there is none) apart from the classic mild and non-offensive grain malt, and the taste, well I don't detect any (1.0 again for no taste). This stuff is even more non-descript than most of its competitors which is probably why it will be a huge success. 



Presumably Budweier has worked out that the masses don't want taste and therefore don't want real beer. They clearly prefer this processed product. A bit like choosing Velveeta over a classically matured, vintage English Cheddar. No point in having a discussion about their relative merits, they are simply different things. This is beer????"

Frothy head with globules of sticky lace adhering to the Young's pint glass that this is displayed in. Perfect hop/malt balance, with more hops coming through in the finish than are present up front. The ending is as smooth as silk.



A classic example of the style, the kind of beer I want to have premanently at hand to remind me of what real beer really is. Having drunk a disappointing beer, or a hopelessly non-descript macro, I could crack one of these and have my faith in beer restored instantly.

Cream Ale? Well I'm not sure about that. I suspect that this has had sufficient adjunts added to make it not much more or less than a macro adjunct lager.



Slight skunkiness in the smell (alright - clear glass, I know) - but to be truthful this is no worse than many other macro's in dark glass. Good looker with a nice head, but the tatstes are utterly non-descript.



Typical lack of body as one would expect from a North American macro, no distinct aromas and instantly forgetable in most respects.

Deep brownish red color, with no sign of a head. My wife described it as flat iced tea, and that is a pretty accurate description of what you see.
There is immense sweet and sour tartness that come together in the flavor. A bit like the old lager and blackcurrant mixing days of my adolescence; a bit of cider in there too and finally a bit of the Lidemanns lambic cassis. A really rounded fruit, sweet and tart experience with some additional mulled wine spices evident as well.

A much better experience that I was anticipating. I was expecting a lot of hops, but was pleasantly suprised by the balance of this brew and the prominence of the malt character.
Beautiful, deep mahogany pour, just a classic looking BW. The head on these high ABV BW's can make all the difference to the appearance, and this was a lovely one. Tall, rocky and ivory and gave some good lacing. Full, oily and viscous in the mouth exactly as it should be.
Lots of ripe fruits all the way through, and a significant alcohol threat! Just when you think this is going to be an easy drinker, it reminds you that it is more of a sipper, and that it needs to be handled with care.
Lovely balance, great drinkability and a malt monster nose to invigorate the senses. Hop bitterness in the finish, but all in great harmony. Serious metallic bitterness in the aftertaste and a lingering hop bite.
An unusual Bastard indeed - beer that lives all the way up to the hype."

Light orange pour with a fast receeding head despite an aggressive pour. Some malts and biscuit in the nose, and a very mild, sweet taste initially. A little hop bitterness in the finish, but not much to speak of.



Possible cross-over beer - not because it is particulalry good, but it would serve two purposes. It might open up the macro crowd's eyes to the possibility of investigating some micro's, and secondly it is very mild, bland and 100% unoffensive.

Very attractive, dark amber/copper pour with a lovely ivory colored, tight head. Great looking beer. 



Aroma's are malty and significant alcohol, but tempered by the sugary sweetness that comes through strong. A ""warm"" aroma - very inviting.



This is a highly drinkanle BW that gets my vote ahead of something like Bigfoot simply because the emphasis here comes down on the malt side rather than the hop side. Hops are there, but they are balanced nicely to give a much more drinkable and satisfying brew than some other American ""English"" BW's.

This beer was originally brewed by Cabezon but was swallowed up by Rio Grande when the Cabezon outfit closed. I'm not sure if they are still brewing this, or if this was a bottle left over from the original brewer, but I've added it at Todd's suggestion.



Good looking pour, jet back with a lovely tan head. The head fades quickly to reveal a creamy, spotty layer on the surface of the body. The fact that there is no lacing gives away the fact that the beer is incredibly thin. There is virtually no body to this beer, it's terribly weak and watery and as a result the mouthfeel for a Stout is very, very poor.



Outside of that the smell is good with lots of burned chocolate notes and some smoke. However the appearance and smell are let down first by the taste (similar to, but not as deep as the aroma) and then by the mouthfeel (hopelessly weak).

Mouthfeel is full, aftertaste is mild grapefruit hops but they fade nicely to leave a rich creaminess with a little edge but no harshness. Balance again is the watch word.

Good, reddish copper colored pour and it still has that flesh colored head. Sooo typical of SN with hops, hops, hops everywhere. I KNOW it's typical of the style, but SN just overdoes it all the time!

Oh dear. This is a brew that FRESH, is purely and simply, poorly constructed.
It looks like a Barleywine with a classic viscous reddish pour and small and flesh colored head, and it smells like a Barleywine with the alcohol and malts coming through good and strong and long, but then it turns into a West Coast hop nightmare.
There is absolutely NOTHING in the taste other than a pungent, cloying, saliva sucking tannic grapefruit that fades to leave an equally unpleasant feeling of having sucked on some copper coinage. This is one of the nastiest, unbalanced, out-of-style beers I have had in sometime.
It's meag-hopped out of the style, and then goes on to fall further toward the undrinkable end of the hop scale. I drank the remainder of the bottle because I can hardly ever face pouring beer away, but it was a struggle.
Two further thoughts; firstly there are countless other better examples of the style out there - try them ALL before Bigfoot, and secondly I will cellar the rest of the six pack for at least 12 months to see if things change. For now - YUK!"

Two separate reviews in one here. First the pour without the yeast; lovely, quite lively carbonated, golden pour. Small head and lots of smooth bitterness up font. Delicious balance with a biting finish and warming aftertaste.
Secondly the pour with the sediment; obviously alters the appearance and cuts back on the bitterness, but still absolutely delicious. Distinct aroma of mown grass and tempered hops.
The Rye lends an initial sweetness that is unusual and fades quickly.
Great label with lots of information including ingredients. A nice, simple note about bottle conditioning too and some information about the beer itself."

This was very expensive ($9.90 for a small bottle - yes I was shafted) and there are a multitude of beers that represent better value. Next time I'll be buying this from a store and not in a bar. Store cost is nearer to $8-$9 for a 750 mL. much, much better value.

This is its main strength.



A light orange colored pour, typical for your general IPA and a modest but well formed head meet the eye. The aroma's are subdued, as are the initial flavors, with a simple balance of malt, alcohol, hops and some aniseed like herbs. The hops are barely noticeable (even I have been conditioned by the super-heavy hops of other brews), until the finish.

Continues to grow on me. Definitely less viscous than so many others in the style, even lighter color and better head than I remember from the '04 version. Good lacing too. This is the American BW that is not an American BW! Don't get me wrong, it still has the warming alcohol and the hoppy characteristics, but these seem to be increasingly reserved for the finish rather than the upfront tastes.

Standard pour, color and lack of head for a Barleywine or a high ABV brew, but that's where the similarities end.
Much lighter than a typical American BW, and some seriously different tastes. I definitely get the sherry notes that are noted on the bottle neck, and I get lots of distinct, ripe fruits in the first mouthful. What I don't get is the same thick, syrupy mouthfeel, in fact I was very surprised with the lighter nature of the body of this beer.

Great looking Porter with an amazing aroma coming from the opaque, black body. Chocolate up front, with a hoppy, bitter, smoky finish that follows some excellent smoothness early on.

Original Review: (Unsure of bottle age).



Delicious.



Pale red pour with a clarity that I found striking and unexpected. Small head that leaves quickly as expected.



Lots of alcohol in the nose, and some distinct hoppiness that suprised me. The taste is not complex to me, just exactly what I was expecting. A solid maltiness which battles with the strong alcohol for your attention. Finishes round and creamy in the mouth and with a distinct dry bite. Nicely done.

Great looking ""orangy"" colored pour with a small, but perfectly formed, bubbly head. The look is good, but this brew isn't about looks.
Firstly the aromas are hops, more hops and then some more hops. A rounded, wonderful citrus, floral variety that just seems to hit the perfect balance.
Tastes are mainly grapefruit, but these are tempered citrus tones. Obviously it's more potent than the 60 or 90, but it has the same characteristic subtlety. The tongue gets the full treatment, being bathed in flavor and variety of sensations. There's the citrus, followed by the grass, followed by the fruits, followed by the floral, followed by the crisp, biting hop finish. This drinks nowhere near it's 20.0 odd % ABV, it has been beautifully crafted to mask the alcohol.

Even after letting the beer settle and despite some painstakingly careful pouring, the amount of froth and carbonation was excessive making it a pain in the backside to get at.
Anyway, having got it into the glass it looks a dirty red/brown, murky color with a very feint pink froth on top. The froth is persistent. It's somewhat tart, but at the same time sweet (if that's possible) a real sweet and sour experience. The cherries are not obvious to me, apart from the color, in fact it seems like much more of a general fruit experience than a specific one.
Very refreshing and would be an ideal ladies aperitif, but not something I'm going to be drinking a lot of. For me this is OK, but strictly novelty, it's simply too much like a wine cooler for my taste. Not really my idea of ""beer""."

Drinks well below its 10.00% ABV, with a smoothness that is uncharacteristic of such a high ABV brew. It's like a cross between an old ale and a barleywine that has tempered, but still big and rounded. Lots of balance here.

The alcohol was very porly masked and any subtlety that was supposed to be there in terms of hops or malt was lost on me. Definite lack of smoothness.

Simple golden color with strong carbonation leading to an attractive head. Of course, this doesn't last long.

Classic, cloudy, washed out lemon colored pour with a huge head and broken lace on the glass. Looks good. 
Aroma is very funky and tart, and is a cross between a good old fashioned West Country (England/Somerset/Devon) Cider, and a Saison. Nice, soft carbonation yields a satisfying mouthfeel. 
Plenty of tart acidity in the taste. Surprisingly the apple-like, tart acidity is main feature of the taste. Little of the usual corriander, clove character shines through. For me, the tartness makes this brew taste cider/saison like, and takes it a little away from your normal Wit. Maybe some age would change all of this.

Original Review

I'd been waiting to try this one for a long time. A culmination of one of my favorite brewers, and one of my favorite styles. Paid $3.19 for a single 11.2oz bottle, which I suspect was way too much, but I had to buy it out of state when I was away from home since I've never seen this is GA.
Poured into a Hoegaarden glass it's a much paler, less yellow (a dirty orange) color than many of its counterparts, in fact it looks a lot like a classic farmhouse Devonshire cider (a good Scrumpy).
Disappointing head - not as large as I was expecting, not much retention and no lacing. Some prickly carbonation at the beginning. Much less aggressive spices and yeasty cloves than I was expecting, in fact the whole experience was more muted than I was hoping for. On the upside it does give a very rounded experience.
A little disappointing overall, perhaps because I had a set of unrealistic expectations associated with this beer before I even tried it. There are several, better value Wit's out there."

There are dense fruits that dominate the initial flavors but this doesn't last long. After that I get plenty of alcohol and a syrupy but drinkable concoction associated with this type of beer. Not a classical Barley Wine, but a drinkable, modern version.

A magnificent meal in a bottle! Delicious, big, thick head with a really chewy overall feeling. Amazing bready experience all the way through.
There’s no doubt here that you are getting a serious beer. From the initial highly aromatic alcohol that reaches the nose, through the richness of the mouthfeel and coating, all the way to the bitter finish and the layered malty sweetness, this is a beer for those who appreciate robust styles. Bitter coffee notes prevelant early in the glass too.
One of the best beers I have had the pleasure of drinking in recent years.
This is the second Stoudt’s beer that I have been very impressed by.
Great packaging too - Love the label."

To me it hits an interesting balance between a Wit, a Pilsner and a Fruit beer, that somehow makes it a pretty interesting and worthwhile experience. It combines the best features of all of those styles and somehow (I don't really know how) pulls off a decent brew experience. For all of that, I do find it difficult to take this too seriously, and it does remain strictly in my ""novelty"" category.

I was expecting that, but what I was not expecting was such a delightful creaminess, a super drinkability and a lovely mouthfeel. Leaving the fruit to one side for a moment, those qualities in this beer are exceptional, regardless of the style.
Yes, the fruit IS dominating, and if you generally dislike fruit beers I suspect you'll hate #9, but with it comes a lovely deep orangey color, a thick satisfying motuhfeel, lovely carbonation and a super-refreshing experience.

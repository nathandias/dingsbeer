Brouwerij De Keersmaeker,Mort Subite Cassis,,,Lambic - Fruit,4.00%,bottle,4.03,4.5,4,4,4,4,11/11/2005,"Dark orange/pink pour with a fantastic head and magnificent lacing. As some others have noticed there was a certain champagne like character to this beer.



Obvious sweet start with the infused blackcurrant taste, that gives a degree of tartness in the finish but not much else. Very fruity and refreshing, but this for me is strictly a once in a very long while brew.



Less obviously syrupy and sweet that the Lindemans range of ""Lambics"", and a million times more drinkable than much of the Cantillion range, I put this in the ""genuine, but drinkable"" range of Lambics tthat neither of the other common Lambics in the USA (cantillion and Lindemans) fall into.



Good middle of the road fruit Lambic and definitely a much better option than many others to introduce newbies to the style. Still gives genuine representation without shocking like say, a Cantillion Kriek."
Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,Sierra Nevada Harvest Wet Hop Ale,,,American IPA,6.70%,on-tap,4.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,11/7/2005,"Very nice, I enjoyed this on tap at Taco Mac in Marietta, GA.



Initially I was not expecting much from this as I am generally not a huge fan of SN products. Don't get me wrong I like them, but not to the extent that many other BA's seem to enjoy them. However I was delighted at what I found.



Great, clear, copper colored pour with a decent head and some lacing and retention. Good crisp clear hoppy aroma, but the initial mouthfuls are sweet malts. Then the hops kick in in a clean and sharp way that is much less oppressive than this beers' more brash, big brother, the Celebration Ale. The hops are just as obvious here, but the seem to be tempered by the better balance that this beer achieves. Still some metal in the finish though.



Good refreshing mouthfeel, and all in all well balanced and really rather good. One of the better SN products."
Williams Brothers Brewing Company,Alba Scots Pine Ale,,,Scottish Gruit / Ancient Herbed Ale,7.50%,bottle,3.43,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,11/6/2005,"According to the label the spruce and pine sprigs were collected in May 1998. Best before the end of June 2006.



Attractive light red/amber pour, good carbonation and as a result decent head and a small amont of lacing.



Aroma is largely caramel malts, with a little nutty sweetness in there too. Taste reflects that, with the additional ingredients of sweetness and some floral character from the organic Pine additions.



Drinks well below it's ABV, but a little too sweet even for my tastes (I like a good malty, sweet beer). The floral nature is a bit of a novelty but wears off pretty quickly. Not as good as the Heather Ale by the same brewer."
Tommyknocker Brewery,Imperial Nut Brown Ale,,,American Brown Ale,9.80%,bottle,4.15,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,11/5/2005,"Pretty darn nice. I like the bottle presentation too, with the gold foil and nice label.



Excellent deep brown color, and lovely tan head that is really quite creamy. A small amount of lacing. The alcohol comes through strong, but there is a nice balance amongst the malt, hops and nuttiness. A roasted richness is present as well.



I was a bit dubious of this being classified as a brown ale with the relatively high ABV, since to me one of the more characteristic traits of a great brown ale is likely to be its mild, easy drinking nature. I thought that this could be impaired by the alcohol but they seem to complement one another.



Alcohol is prominent in the nose too.



Very smooth drinking and a nice, full mouthfeel. More and more nuttiness in the finish as it warms.



Label says enjoy with four months of June '05, but as usual this seems largely a meaningless stat as I thought this was super a couple of months later, and doubtless would be for a long, long time yet.



Very, very nice, good value too @ $2.95 for the 473 mL bottle."
North Coast Brewing Co.,Silver Jubilee - 25th Anniversary Ale,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,7.30%,bottle,3.88,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,11/4/2005,"Orange, gold cloudy pour, with a good initial head and some decent lacing. Slightly above average appearance, and it's nicely in line with the style.



There's much more grapefruit and citrus notes here than in others of the same style that I have encountered. There is some real acidity in the drink that goes beyond the usual ""funkiness"" for the Saison. A bit sour in fact.



Still remains drinkable and tasty, but a little on the tart side for my liking. The Saison style can still be determined, but I prefer a less edgey beer to keep it within the style."

2005 Vintage
Got a chance to revisit this at The Brick Store - thanks to Simon for the sample. Rumor has it that this vintage topped out at around 24%!
Great legs in the glass, silky smooth and chocked FULL of flavor. About on"
Oy Sinebrychoff Ab,Sinebrychoff Porter,,,Baltic Porter,7.20%,bottle,3.85,5,3.5,4,4,3.5,11/1/2005,"Jet black with some ruby red highlights at the extreme bottom of the glass. A very solid, tan colored head that is really very, very substantial - in fact it looks like a big ice-cream float. Good lacing that increases with warmth. Very good looker.



Some alcohol in the nose, but not a great deal more.



Smooth, but some degree of bitterness at the same time, quite an unusual combination. The bitterness lingers in the mouth too. Not quite as smooth as I would like, I enjoy my Porters a bit creamier, and in fact I would go as far as to say it has a lot more Stout like qualities. Mouthfeel is good, but a little on the thin side for me.



I enjoyed drinking this with a chocolate brownie. The combination of sweet and bitter really went very nicely together, but the drinkability is not very high."
Rogue Brewery (Brewer's on the Bay),Hazelnut Brown Nectar,,,American Brown Ale,6.20%,bottle,3.75,4,2.5,4,3.5,4.5,10/30/2005,"Light brownish, garnet color, that when held up to the light takes on some serious red highlights and looks a lot thinner than I was imagining it would look. Some bubbly, cream colored head form an aggreesive pour. The head is not sustained though and there is little or no lacing. Pretty good looking brown ale, especially strong in the body color appearance.



Obviously from the name I was expecting some hazelnut in the aroma, but frankly I got very little if any nut smell in the nose.



Pretty malty, sweet drinking, with a smooth nutty ""character"" rather than a nutty taste. In classic Rogue fashion, the beer ends with a hop bite. Not the usual, massive over the top hop assault that has put me off so many Rogue products, but still noticebale and still enough to make me think that it slightly pushes it out of the style.



As it warms it smooths out a little, to give a very slightly nuttier feel, but with this comes a bit more acid in the finish.



A strange mish-mash of flavors that, in the end, sort of work well together to produce a very drinkable, somewhat quirky version of the style."
Thirsty Dog Brewing Company,Siberian Night Imperial Stout,,,Russian Imperial Stout,9.70%,bottle,4.28,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,10/30/2005,"Very solid example of the style.



Jet black appearance with some red highlights when held up to an intense light. Obviously very little head unless poured from some height into the glass. Whatever foam that creates, is gone quickly and doesn't really make the spotty, creamy film that I would like to see.



Pretty sweet rather than dark and bitter. I like it that way, but I expect it will be too sweet for some, especially those who are expecting,or looking for, a more hoppy RIS.



Incredibly smooth mouthfeel, a silky experience of a beer to consume.



Drinkability is high for the style, but obviously a little limited by the alcohol."
Brouwerij Huyghe,Delirium Nocturnum,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,8.50%,bottle,4.03,4.5,4,4,4,4,10/28/2005,"2004 printed on cork.



Corked and caged ""ceramic"" bottle. Poured into a St. Bernardus chalice I get a very deep brown mahogany body and an initially large head that fades pretty quickly. The head falls back to give a modest, but very attractive thin, spotty, creamy film across the large expanse of the surface. Each sip pulls some lacing up the side of the glass and reveals its true character - an immensley fine carbonation, with incredibly small bubbles and a frothy, fine texture. Very, very attractive.



Standard fruit esters make up the bulk of the aroma, but they are not overwhelming, in fact rather understated.



Mouthfeel increases in depth as in warms. In terms of the taste the finish is dry and long and leaves a little hop bitterness. A tiny bit a citrus at the very end. As the warms it rounds a little to bring the tastes to the fore. Frankly it's quite dry and lacks the really rich fruit depth that one might expect from the style. Reminds me much more of a Dubbel that anything else.



Nice, but not a stunning brew, a little dry and a little lack of deep fruit flavor."
North Coast Brewing Co.,Cru D'or,,,Dubbel,8.00%,bottle,3.75,3.5,4.5,3.5,3,4,10/28/2005,"***Originally on BA this was classified as a Tripel and was the re-classified (correctly) as a Dubbel.



Amber pour, with some chill haze, good initial head and some lacing. I'm looking for a lighter, more golden color in my Tripel's*** though.



Very nice aroma that has a mixed ripe fruit character and that classic Belgian yeast strain present.



A little bit of alcoholic edge to the taste, nice Belgian feel and a bit of a drier finish than I expected. Lacks the deep sweet alcoholic fruitiness of a Tripel.



Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side and shys away from the slick, thick sweetness that a typical Tripel would have.



This is a drinkable and nice ""everyday"" Belgian, but I don't think it is very faithful to the Tripel moniker. In fact it is much, much more like a Dubbel than anything else. Lacks the sweet, slick, alcoholic feel of a Tripel and therefore loses some style points. Having said all of that this is a beer that is good quality, good to drink and definitely worth a try at $5.99 for a 4 pack.



Note: After the initial review this was re-categorized on BA as a Dubbel, just as I thought!"
"Orion Beer Co., Ltd.",Orion Premium Draft Beer,,,Japanese Rice Lager,4.70%,bottle,1.78,2,2,1.5,3,1.5,10/25/2005,"633 mL brown tall tapered bottle, pale orange/yellow urine color with zero lacing and only a tiny film of head left on top of the beer. Not much carbonation completes the lacklustre and weak appearance.



Aroma and taste are all sweet, adjunct corn based.



The taste is amazingly sweet, with not much of the crisp dry lager that I was expecting. In fact it's syrupy sweet all the way through. No character, no body, no point!



Average mouthfeel, this simply tastes like a sweet North American macro adjunct. I doubt that I could determine this from loads of other junk. Never again."
Brasserie de l'Abbaye des Rocs s.a.,La Montagnarde [Brasserie Des Rocs Ambree],,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,9.00%,bottle,4.45,4.5,4,4.5,4,5,10/23/2005,"Deep orange, butterscotch poured into a Leffe goblet, coupled with a beautiful head and some lacing, this tempts the palate just from the look alone. This is the reason you don't drink beer from the bottle!
In a nutshell this is simply a mild and classy, classic Belgian. Typical yeast character, typical flavors, typical smooth mouthfeel, typical quality exudes from this insanely drinkable beer.
It has a lot of sweetness, but this is masked by the combination of yeast, alcohol and tiny hop bite in the finish. Not the very best from this magical brewery, but close."
Terrapin Beer Company,Terrapin Big Hoppy Monster,,,American Amber / Red Ale,8.30%,on-tap,4.35,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,10/22/2005,"Beautiful garnet color (including the red highlights), delicious frothy head and superb lacing complete the great look.
Pure hops in the nose, but not overwhelming.
Rich, dark and hoppy - that just about sums it up. It's reminiscent of a classic, (very strong) English Cask Ale that has been overhopped.
Induces some lovely hop burps, this is truly a lovely, smooth drink, but at the same time punches above its weight. A truly nice package."
The Matt Brewing Company,Saranac Kölsch,,,Kölsch,5.00%,bottle,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,10/18/2005,"Nice looker, clear golden color and a small head and a little lacing.



Light peppery flavor is the over-riding experience here. Dryish finish with some mild hop flavor. Not much balance of malt apparent, but becasue the hop flavor is reserved and mild, it doesn't really matter.



Crisp in the mouth with a refreshing bite that makes this a drinkable, if somewhat average brew.



Good value, simple, drinkable beer. This will not surprise or thrill you, but you might enjoy sucking a few back."
The Matt Brewing Company,Saranac Hefeweizen,,,Hefeweizen,5.60%,bottle,2.98,2.5,2.5,3,3,3.5,10/18/2005,"Slightly odd looking, in as much as it appears to be semi-filtered. Not as cloudy as we might otherwise anticipate for the style, but also not showing much clarity. Not much head and not much lacing, certainly no evidence of a big pillowy head that one might hope for.



Banana and clove aroma is strong, and the inital tastes reflect that. Unfortunately it's all a little weak and watery, and somewhat artificial. A little sharp citric acidity in the finish which finally terminates with a little hop profile, but not much.



Not bad and certainly drinkable, but this is not a very good Hefe, despite it not being a bad beer. I'd put this in as a potential crossover that won't be too much for your average BMC guy. A gentle introduction to something a bit different."
The Matt Brewing Company,Saranac Mountain Ale,,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,5.00%,bottle,3.08,4,1.5,3.5,3,3.5,10/16/2005,"OK, not your everyday kind of beer, and it does have a somewhat artificial flavor about it, but despite that it remains drinkable.



Good looking beer on all fronts. Nice burned gold coloring, decent head and some definitely better than average lacing.



Aroma is not great. A sort of acidic vinegar smell pervades the ""beer"" smell. Its weakest point.



Tastes. Definitely infused berry taste that is tart, and it blocks out most of the other potential flavors. Despite this, it finishes clean and crisp and is pretty refreshing. I was surprised that I like this, because there is a definite artificial feel about this, but it remains refeshing, clean and easy to drink. Odd really because this is NOT the kind of beer I usually embrace much.



Good value in the Saranac, ""Beers of Summer"" 12 pack (includes 6 different beers) for $10.99."
Brauerei Tucher Brau,Tucher Kristall Weizen,,,Kristalweizen,5.10%,bottle,3.9,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,10/15/2005,"Extremely interesting. If we (I) were reviewing entirely within the style (sorry, but I think that is *almost* impossible to do) this would be close to perfect!



Absolute clarity in the pour with a great looking head and some lacing that was quite ""hard"", with significant lines of foam separated by large areas of non-lacing.



Aroma is perfect to style, with subdued cloves and bananas.



Good mouthfeel, quite crisp.



Taste gives an unusual smoky flavor which significantly detracts from the experience. I'm not at all sure what I am tasting, but it feels artificial and smoke based. Very, very odd! Indeed, a wee bit plastic!



Great in some ways, not so good in others. How odd, I really don't know what else to say!"
The Matt Brewing Company,Saranac Summer Ale,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,4.70%,bottle,3.88,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,10/15/2005,"Actually rather good.



Nice dark gold color, with plenty of good carbonation, a decent head and a some, but not a lot of lacing. 



A nice, mild spice and lemon aroma and taste. The lemon is not as subtle as the label suggests, but it just about pulls it off. Mouthfeel is light, but that is in touch with the style.



Very refreshing and tasty. This is not a classic by any stretch of the imagination, but very drinkable. Nice hot weather beer, and with temperatures still in the low 80's in Atlanta in mid-October it does a nice job. Good value and in a good package too, as part of the 6 style, $10.99, summer 12 pack from Saranac."
The Matt Brewing Company,Saranac Belgian White,,,Witbier,5.30%,bottle,2.93,3.5,2.5,3,2,3.5,10/15/2005,"OK, this is not a classic Belgian Wit, but it is drinkable and it is leaning toward the style, even if it is not typical.



A very pale, thin looking orange hazy appearance, with a small fluffly head and some mild lacing.



Aromas and taste are ""Wit-like"", but somewhat watered down for the style. 



Drinkable, but way too lightweight for the whole wit concept for any truth in the whole wit nomenclature. Mouthfeel is watery and poor.



One of the poorer efforts from this crossover brewer. Maybe this is just a bridge too far for Saranac!?"

Well, 4+ years on this beer, time to crack one open. 
Firstly the pop on opening gave an indication of things to come. It was small, and although not completely dead it was disappointingly slight. I was anticipating some drop"
Broughton Ales Ltd,Merlin's Ale,,,Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB),4.20%,bottle,2.55,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,10/14/2005,"Surprisingly pale and slightly cloudy appearance with an impressive head and some very nice, sticky lacing. The body is Hefe in color and appearance. Points added for head and lacing, but subtracted for the color.



Typical light bodied, low ABV British bitter - except for the color and the taste - way, way too light in both categories for the normal.



Light, slightly citrus aroma, but there's really not much there at all.



Flavor and tastes are light. Quite dry and light hops are the order of the day but it's really not at all impresive. I don't like this a great deal, just too light, non-descript and hoppily dry, but without much character."
The Matt Brewing Company,Saranac Golden Pilsener,,,German Pilsener,5.10%,bottle,3.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,10/13/2005,"Very pale golden, with pretty much absolute clarity. Small head, not much lacing. Decent looking.



Some sweet, malty wheat aroma, with a very, very small amount of hops in there too.



Flavors are very mild, quite clean and refreshing. A little, typical Pilsener hop bitterness, but not a lot, and it fades pretty quickly.



Essentially this is a lightweight Pilsener at best, and probably slips out of the style because of its lack of hoppy character. 



Not especially good in terms of being a Pilsener, but having said that it is a drinkable and unoffensive beer that you can enjoy as a easy drinking, good value cross-over. Don't expect too much and you'll be happy."
Atlantic Brewing Company,Brother Adam's Bragget Ale,,,Braggot,11.80%,bottle,3.93,3.5,4,4,4.5,3.5,10/11/2005,"Part of the November 2000 batch.
Dark amber pour with little or no head, and no lacing.
Aroma is pure alcohol laced sweetness, and this is pretty much perfectly replicated in the taste. Basically it tastes like an Old Ale with the honey added, and ends up tasting like a drinkable (relatively light) English Barleywine. Alcohol is very strong.
Luxurious in the mouth, this is a silky smooth and soft oily experience. Obviously you are not going to drink much of this, but over the course of an evening it's a nice sipper.
Like almost everyone else I have very little, if any, reference point to judge this within the style, but I will say that the brew drinks pretty much the way it states on the label."
BridgePort Brewing Co. / Brewpub + Bakery,Bridgeport IPA,,,American IPA,5.50%,bottle,3.38,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,10/10/2005,"I like the bottle - slightly different shape and nice, raised lettering with a neck label.



Pale golden pour, with some chill haze, nice head and a better than average collection of lacing.



Definite and pronounced grapefruit sharpness and bitter start, but it is very short. Finish is non-descript. Mouthfeel is average.



Light citrus in the nose.



A little metallic tang in the aftertaste.



An American IPA that doesn't quite do it for me. A little ordinary - not bad, just ordinary."
Stoudts Brewing Co.,Oktober Fest,,,Märzen / Oktoberfest,5.00%,bottle,3.35,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,10/10/2005,"Crystal clear, light copper colored pour with only a fleeting head and little or no lacing.



Some mild hops and very, very mild spice in the nose.



Mild flavor all around. Some light malts start the taste and then the shortest of stinging hops finish it. Sweet in the mouth, light and very easy drinking, this is a beer that is nice, but at the same time not really very characterful.



Body is very average, almost seems diluted a bit.



Stoudt's makes some wonderful beers, this isn't really one of them. Not bad, still drinkable, but there are much better versions of the style out there, and much, much better beers by the same brewer."

12/04/02 Bottling.
Thick and noisy, bright copper colored pour with a good head that dies quickly due to the 11% ABV. The lacing is obviously minimal.
Very sweet malts in the nose and not much else, except sugar coated sugar!
There are some very big hops in the finish but they are not remotely bitter. They simply serve to even out a beer that would otherwise be simply too much to handle in terms of malt sweetness and alcohol.
There is a little whisky character in the finish as well.
Obviously a sipper, but a very, very drinkable high ABV Barleywine. Unusually smooth and drinkable for the style, in fact so much so I gave it a 5. It's big in the mouth but at the same time not overpowering."
Brauerei Tucher Brau,Tucher Bajuvator Doppelbock,,,Doppelbock,7.20%,bottle,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,10/8/2005,"Delicious.



Super, dark-brown, garnet body. Aggressive pour produces a magnificent thick frothy head. Some nice lacing into the bargain. Looks great.



Caramel malts are completely and magnificently present. It's all malt but it has an unexpected, and wonderfully balance-effecting, peppery ending. The finish adds a real unexpected bitterness that is unusual for the style but makes it a great beer. The balance makes this amazingly drinkable.



Brown sugar malts with some burned chocolate in there too. 



Mouthfeel is full and satisfying and I was delighted with this purchase."
Brauerei Tucher Brau,Tucher Helles Hefe Weizen,,,Hefeweizen,5.40%,bottle,3.98,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,10/8/2005,"A light butterscotch, cloudy pour with a classic large head and some lovely lacing. True to the style this shows some great appearance attributes.



Bananas and cloves are present in the nose, but these are somewhat muted. Good and typical for the style, but not large.



Creamy smooth mouthfeel and taste, with a little more promise that the nose suggests but not a lot more.



Clean and easy to drink, but not really big in taste or presence. I quantify this as a high quality Hefe, with some classic quaities but it is muted and this is not a brash beer. In fact rather understated."
Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,Olde School Barleywine,,,American Barleywine,15.00%,bottle,4.45,4.5,4,4.5,4,5,10/8/2005,"Hazy orange, slightly oily looking body (from the alcohol presumably) a nice, small sustained head and some better than average lacing.
Smooth sweet caramel in the nose. Full in the mouth, lovely satisfying oils and a warm kick in the finish.
Very, very well disguised alcohol, much lighter drinking than the style would suggest. Sweet, tasty and rich. Although this is obviously a serious brew, it is amazingly drinkable and light. I'm giving it a 5 for drinkability in relation to the ""usually not very easy to drink style"".
My experience with American Barleywines has been a bit hit and miss with some just being too much. I have come to the conclusion that I have to drink sweeter, malt based BW's rather than the hop based ones. This is a great example of a sweet/malt brew that reminds me a lot of an very strong Belgian Pale.
Sip it, enjoy it and savor those complex fruits.
DFH is a GREAT brewery, and this is another example of a wonderful, wonderful piece of craft brewing."
Goose Island Beer Co.,Christmas Ale,,,American Brown Ale,5.60%,bottle,4.53,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,10/7/2005,"2003 edition (I think). BB 03/28/04.



Beautiful red/brown dark color with a smashing looking head, lovely thick, tan color with some nice lacing.



Rich, smooth fruit and marzipan aroma. Mouthfeel is good, but it doesn't quite live up to the smell which is much, much richer. To be fair it would be difficult for the taste to match the smell.



Taste is perfect for the style. Lots of cascading fruits, with a drier than expected hop based finish.



A really interesting beer, it has a dark Belgian fruity feel and at the same time a dry, hoppy finish. These are competing features but they seem to juxtaposition uncommonly well.



I enjoyed it."
Offshore Ale Company,Offshore Amber Ale,,,American Amber / Red Ale,5.50%,bottle,3.58,5,3,3.5,3.5,4,10/7/2005,"The massive froth head that, at first is incredibly annoying but after walking away for about three minutes, leaves a huge amount of fantastic lacing and a spectacular rocky head. The lacing alone makes this a ""5"" on the appearance scale. After a ridiculous pour, it turned out to be one of the best looking beers I have seen in a long tome. Very hazy light, golden color in the pour too. All in all pretty interesting appearance.



Kind of sweet and light, reminded me a little of fruit juice. Aroma is not great - a little bit acid and apple like, but the taste does better than the smell would suggest. Lightness and acidity does come back a little in the finish though.



Mouthfeel is pretty light and this makes it drinkable but the downside is that it makes it a little light for me.



Not my favorite style, but this is a good beer that has crossover potential. Worth investigating."
Great Lakes Brewing Company,Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald Porter,,,American Porter,5.80%,bottle,4.18,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,10/5/2005,"Very nice.



Good Porter color, extremely dark, but not quite black - there are some definite brown highlights coming through with this one.



Aroma's are very creamy, coffee based, and this is replicated in the tastes. What I like about this Porter is the mild ABV and the creamy body rather than some huge assault on the senses. In that respect this Porter reminds me of the more traditional English Porters that combined easy, smooth drinkability with understated taste.



Drinkability is high, and the mouthfeel deliciously smooth."
Berkshire Brewing Company Inc.,Coffeehouse Porter,,,American Porter,6.20%,bottle,2.2,4,2,2,2,2.5,10/3/2005,"If the truth be told I didn't much care for this. I prefer my Porters to have a creamier body and some substantial depth rather that the thin nature of the brew that I experienced here.



Pours well and looks good, but the aroma immediately gives away the nature of the beer. Artificial would be the word I would use. Lots of cold coffee smells and tastes, and not much else.



Couple the disappointing tastes with a very, very thin mouthfeel and this is a ""Porter"" to forget. Very false coffee sensation for me, that lacked smoothness, but most importantly lacked any depth. Not good at all. Like cold instant coffee."
Offshore Ale Company,Offshore IPA,,,American IPA,6.20%,bottle,4.13,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,10/3/2005,"Very good. Absolutely solid version of the style, keeping well within the remit and knowing its limits perfectly.



The most refreshing change is the fact that this beer really is an authentic American IPA, that is simply being an IPA. It is saying something that having picked up, double this and double that and Imperial the other, that one can enjoy a simple IPA that tastes like, well a simple IPA!



Excellent color, classic orange, with a lovely looking head and some first class lacing.



Simple hop based aromas in the nose that don't peel the mucous membranes away friom the inside of your nostrils and a mild grapefruit citrus taste complements the package.



Satisfying mouthfeel and a first-class drinkability.

Avery Brewing Company,Salvation,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,9.00%,bottle,3.98,3.5,4,4,4,4,10/2/2005,"Beautiful, golden clarity with a good head, but it disappears quickly to leave little or no lacing. More retention would be nice.



Initial tastes are like a strong Euro lager, but the Belgian yeasts kick in to give an authentic Belgian feel to the long finish. Some cloves in the aroma and taste.



Very nice rounded mouthfeel with alcoholic esters and sweet candied sugared fruits coming through strong. Especially noticeable is the pineapple taste.



As it warms the Belgian character fades and it takes on more of the strong lager feel."
Rapscallion,Rapscallion Creation,,,American Strong Ale,9.50%,bottle,2.48,3,3.5,2.5,2,1.5,10/2/2005,"Sorry, didn't really get this one.



Coca-Cola like appearance with a very thin, very light-gone instantly type of head. No lacing, no retention.



Mildly acidic taste that was reminiscent of apples or an acidic fruit like rhubarb. Cider like in the aroma and the taste. Rough on the palate, burns a little on the way down.



Some alcohol comes through but it is well hidden for such a large ABV. Doesn't make up for the odd combination of tastes and flavors.



Slightly burned, weak instant coffee aftertaste. Not nice at all.



Very thin in the mouth, I don't get this."
Broughton Ales Ltd,Black Douglas Ale,,,Scottish Ale,5.20%,bottle,3.48,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,10/1/2005,"Good looking red/brown pour that extends the color into the head to give a light mocha tinge to the froth. Good lacing apparent, leaving a thin layer of foam on the surface, but not spotty as I like to usually associate with a thin layer.



Everything about the aroma and taste is malt based. It's not remotely sweet, but the malts serve to smooth out the beer to such an extent it becomes a little on the bland side. Don't get me wrong, I like it, but it is a very laid back beer that will not suit the palate of someone needing a malt or hop jolt.



Some dry and bitter hops arrive in the very short finish, but these seems slightly out of place against the majority of the drink being so smooth and malt based. The bitter aftertaste is also really surprising for such a malty beer and is a bit of a shock to the tastebuds - not in a harsh way, it just seems a bit odd.



A little thin in the mouth, but still smooth, this is typical of a UK style, mild tasting bitter, but still a long way from the best that you can find in this group, even in the USA. I wouldn't mind offering this up as an example of what can come out of the UK, but I think I would need to find better examples to impress the locals on this side of the pond.



Not bad, but far too many cheaper, better and similar beers to make this a regular foray."
Berkshire Brewing Company Inc.,Steel Rail Extra Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),5.30%,bottle,2.8,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,3.5,9/29/2005,"Golden orange pour, slightly hazy, very attractive color. Head is scant with some hanging around the extreme edges to give a little ring and some very minor lacing.
Aroma is difficult to pick up, maybe a little wheat or cereal in there?
Taste is very mild, bitter hops, with a short finish. Quite ""lager like"" in its refreshing qualities and its drinkability. Bitterness increases slightly through the beer, but is really rather reserved.
Not much to report here at all. This is an unoffensive beer, but only offers a very simple and mild drinking experience. Not a great deal of flavor, in fact not much of anything at all."
Harpoon Brewery,Triticus Ale (100 Barrel Series #10),,,Wheatwine,11.50%,bottle,4.55,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,9/29/2005,"I've been waiting a long time to try this. I was NOT disappointed.



The presentation is classy. Love the gold foil and the simple complexity (if that makes sense) of the label. It seems to promise much and give the impression of a premium experience.



Like many, the ""Wheat Wine"" style is not one I'm especially familiar with, but this beer tastes and drinks like a cross between a Barleywine and a Doppelbock. Delicious, as it combines the best features of both, and eliminates the less attractive attributes of them.



Color is fantastic - deep mahogany reds with lighter highlights. Lovely, frothy head with a little lacing.



Aroma gives a wonderful fruit malt and hop balance.



Drinks well below its 11.5%, but alcohol is still a factor. This is clearly well crafted brew.



Tastes are rich, fruit, ester and raisin malts with a nice kick of hop character in the lingering finish. A great balance.



Smooth as silk in the mouth, it exudes luxury.



This is a beer that will impress people, both BA's and those not yet converted."
Berkshire Brewing Company Inc.,Lost Sailor India Pale Ale,,,English India Pale Ale (IPA),5.50%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,9/28/2005,"Really attractive dark orange color, nice frothy head with some lacing and some retention.



Good, citrus based hops in the nose and the initial tastes, that give way to some nice smooth character and a sting in the long finish. A little smoky aftertaste.



Very drinkable, and a solid mouthfeel that is substantial enough to make you feel like you are having a beer. Seems to drink above the advertised 5.5% ABV.



Rounded and satisfying, a nice experience. Good solid example of the style, being true to the original English version. Not massive, just well crafted."
Whim Ales,Old Izaak,,,Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB),5.00%,bottle,4.4,3.5,4,4.5,4,5,9/28/2005,"Nice pour in terms of the head and lacing, but the rather drab brown body is not the most attractive I have ever seen.



Aroma is sweet, light malts with a little sugary caramel.



Taste starts off really light, with the malts coming trough strong with a lovely rounded sweetness to them, but then has a surprisingly bitter, hop based, dry finish. An unexpected thrill, that adds some really attractive balance to the brew.



Refreshing, satisfying and the light body and the relatively low ABV adds to the drinkability which is huge. In he mouth it is creamy and silky and the combination means this has session written ALL over it."
Berkshire Brewing Company Inc.,Berkshire Oktoberfest Lager,,,Märzen / Oktoberfest,6.80%,bottle,3.48,3,3,3.5,3.5,4,9/27/2005,"Hazed light brown/orange body with a modest head that fades quickly. No lacing.



Aroma? Well, I don't get much at all except some really dry hops.



Taste is really quite dry for the style. Dry hops are present but the brew is smooth and not bitter, That suggests the malts are there, but they are in no way upfront or aggresive. I would expect more malt character for the style.



Not a great deal of Oktoberfest character here, drinks more like an APA to me. Having said that I quite like it, just not as full of (Oktoberfest) character as I was expecting."
Brooklyn Brewery,Brooklyn Oktoberfest Beer,,,Märzen / Oktoberfest,5.50%,bottle,3.98,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,9/27/2005,"Mid-Amber pour, average head and lacing, fairly standard looking, nice micro appearance.



Soft malt nose, quite low key.



Tastes are dominated by the malt backbone which is strong and solid. Not a big mouthfeel but its a full tasting toffee like experience.



High drinkability since it combines a nice satisfying mouthfeel, with a strong malt taste that is easy to quaff. Solid and delicious. Surprisingly refreshing too."
Thomas Hooker Ales & Lagers,Thomas Hooker Hop Meadow IPA,,,American IPA,6.50%,bottle,2.58,4.5,4,2,2.5,2,9/25/2005,"Good, reddish/amber body and a very attractive head and lacing. Nice looking beer.



Good clean hops in the nose.



The taste is disappointing - incredibly bitter with a lack of layers or complexity. There is very little discerning character, and a lack of malt, sweetness or smoothness. It's bitter all the way without a break. The bitterness is not citrus based either, but much more harsh.



As in warms there is a little more malt character, but it fails to quell the immensely bitter profile.



Mouhtfeel suffers from the acute harshness of the hops and its drinkability obviously goes down too.



I've no problem with hops and lots of them, but there has to be a pay-off. Without balance, malt backbone or layered complexity you get a massive kick in the mouth and not much else."
Great Divide Brewing Company,Hercules Double IPA,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,10.00%,bottle,3.95,5,4,4,4,3.5,9/24/2005,"Nice looking red/Copper body with a lovely dense, slightly orange colored head. The head, body and the lacing are certainly very attractive. Sme chill haze.



The aroma and taste combine to give a definite resin based, pine flavored hop profile. There is not much subtle about it, but it does (just about) pull it off. The finish is sugary citrus, with the grapefruit really being quite bitter. The bitterness continues to grow and slightly reduces the drinkability for me.



Alcohol is well hidden and the mouthfeel is soft."

I drank this stuff from the bottle (which tells its own story) and I would advise you to do the same. Pouring into a glass would only disappoint.



This is not the most offensive macro on the face of the earth, but it is simply utterly bland, virtually tasteless and hardly what one would call beer in terms of taste, mouthfeel and experience.



It's difficult to give this any defining adjectives or characteristics. It's a malted beverage certainly, but outside of that it's just wet.



To be fair it doesn't pretend to be much else, and as long as you're expecting nothing you won't be disappointed."
Grupo Modelo S.A. de C.V.,Corona Light,,,Light Lager,4.10%,bottle,1.05,2,1,1,1,1,9/16/2005,"Slightly offensive aroma drinking from the bottle. Golden yellow color with some skunk.



Interestingly enough, the skunk is the most well defined character of this ""beer""! There is a very, very slight hop bite in the finish, but outside of that this is cold water.



A nasty, dryish mouthfeel completes the deal.



Products like this are simply being marketed and sold to the masses as a consumer item not a beer, so I don't get too upset about its role as a bad beer because I don't suppose the brewer cares, but at the same time I suppose it is giving the brewing industry and beer a bad name. So make of that what you will.



Friends don't let friends drink this kind of product."
Tennent Caledonian Breweries,Tennent's Lager,,,Euro Pale Lager,5.00%,bottle,2.08,3.5,2,2,2,2,9/16/2005,"Utterly non-descript and low quality beer experience.



Pale urine colored pour, some decent carbonation and a small but perfectly formed head. Some scant lacing.



Mild skunk and a typical macro lager corn/grain aroma.



Thin body, and a sweet graininess complete the lower than average package.



Mildy better than a nasty American macro."
Brauerei Schloss Eggenberg,Urbock 23°,,,Doppelbock,9.60%,bottle,3.43,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,9/15/2005,"Golden pour with a nice white head.



Aroma and taste are all liquor based alcohol with some sweetness. Not as cloyingly sweet as I was expecting, but still very sugary and the alcohol can creep up on you.



Lots of alcoholic strength and a bitterish finish to compliment the malty sugar.



Overall, very sweet and very alcoholic. I still prefer my Doppelbocks dark, and malt based rather than golden and alcohol based. These lighter bocks feel very potent to me without the calming influence of the malt."
Flying Dog Brewery,Snake Dog IPA,,,American IPA,7.10%,bottle,3.73,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,9/15/2005,"Nice looking pour, with a good head and some nice lacing. Golden orange color, but really one of the lighter colored American IPA's that I have seen.



Very light and easy drinking hop bitterness in the taste and the aroma. Not at all heavy, which is both a good and bad thing. It makes the beer very drinkable, but it lacks the hop punch of a typical American micro IPA. For that reason, added to the Flying Dog artwork, availability, price and marketing, you have a great crossover beer. For the same reason I suspect that this will disappoint many BA's, and certainly this is not a typical hoppy, American IPA.



Lingering hop bitterness in the finish, but this is slightly soapy and only mildly citrus grapefruit in taste.



I enjoyed this, but it is a long way from the typical American IPA style."

The look is so very pale it doesn't promise much, but the beer drinks a little better than the initial look.



As others have noted, mainly grassy, grainy mild hops and not much else. Despite that mild bitterness this is still a fairly sweet beer.



The forthy texture, the sweetness and the general mild nature of the brew makes it pretty drinkable, but this is a very light experience and pretty unsubstantial. Having said that, a little better than the standard nasty American macro."

Aroma is strongly hop based and some little malt.



It's not a bad beer, but it has one really bad characteristic. There seems to be an artificial and very strong bitterness throughout the whole drink. This is not a hop bitterness, rather a metallic sharpness that detracts from everything else.



Mouthfeel is OK, with a smoothness, but cloying dry bitter finish.



I'm afraid the extra bitter taste detracts from the whole experience."
Avery Brewing Company,Samael's Ale,,,English Barleywine,14.50%,bottle,4.6,4,5,5,4.5,3.5,9/13/2005,"2005 Vintage.
Well, essentially this is a Madeira Port posing as beer. When I smelled this and then drank it, I could think of nothing else.
It's huge in all respects. Alcohol is warming and then burning, the deep and dense liquor smell is absolutely immense, and it drinks like a port. Hugely rich and although not difficult to drink, one is plenty for me in most sitting, settings. A ""one-bottle sipper"" in my opinion.
Aromas and tastes are dominated by the warming, intensely fruity alcohol.
The pour is pretty ordinary looking, reddish brown with a small head, but the viscosity is not ordinary. Very syrupy obviously as a result of the high ABV.
Huge beer and not by an means an everyday drinking beer."

The pour is dark, dark brown with a lovely dense head and some equisite lacing.



The aroma and the taste are simply one. They are deep, deep dark fruits - figs, raisins, plumes and oranges. There is a distinct huge sugar aroma and taste. It's a very, very, very sweet beer. The sheer luxury and sweetness of this beer do subtract a little form it's drinkability. I KNOW that it's not designed to quaffed in huge quantities, but even getting to the bottom of the 750 mL bottle took some doing. Not because it wasn't stunning, but because of the absolute richness of the brew.



Mouthfeel is slick and alcohol soaked fruit.



Finish has a great and unexpected bitter twang that stands significantly different to the malt sweetness that the rest of the beer imparts.

I was expecting this to be like so many apple based alcohol products, that is, just a glorified cider where the apple flavor often tastes very false. This was definitely not like that at all.
Apple malt makes up a simple nose.
A real sweet and sour combination with mild apples holding the whole thing together. Great mouthfeel (exceptionally refreshing) with crisp and bright carbonation and a tart puckering finish.
To be honest it lacks a lot of classic beer character, but, again, this is not cider like either. The taste is really very clean and quite neutral.
Make no mistake, this is a novelty product, in fact it really doesn't taste much like a beer at all, but it is very delicious and exceptionally drinkable."

Avery Brewing Company,Piglet Purgatory,,,American IPA,?,bottle,3.85,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,9/8/2005,"Thanks to mentor for this sample of the beer as let unreleased on to the general public.



Lovely light copper colored body with a very firm looking, dense white head with some very nice lacing.



Pleasant, mildly metallic hops in the nose.



Lots of really quite bitter, citrus grapefruit notes in the taste, against the back drop of a thinner than usual mouthfeel for an American IPA. If I had to characterize it, I would say that this beer has the feel of an English IPA, but with the over-hopped profile typical of it's American version.



It really is quite bitter all the way through the finish, and although it doesn't overpower the beer as a whole, there is a distinct lack of malt presence.



If you like a bitter IPA, with a large hop flavor, but one that is less rounded and full in the mouth than many similar large American IPA's, then you'd enjoy this beer a great deal. Avery Maharaja is an example of a similar, big IPA that drinks ""fuller"" than this."
Brauerei Schloss Eggenberg,Mac Queen's Nessie,,,Scottish Ale,5.00%,bottle,3.05,3.5,2.5,3.5,3,2.5,9/8/2005,"Quite how this is a ""red"" ale, or indeed a Wee Heavy, is really not at all apparent, but here goes anyway.
Pours a dark yellow, and for all intents and purposes, apart from the depth of color, this beer looks like a macro lager. Little or no head and no lacing.
Some fruit and alcohol in the aroma.
Quite oily in the mouth, and the alcohol taste combined with the slick feel make this beer seem much more than the 7.3% would suggest.
Tastes are largely alcohol and a whisky (or other spirit) type of taste. The alcohol comes through very strong, and it drinks above the published ABV.
As it warms it mellows out a little, but this is drinks like a rather strong Euro lager. Not especially smooth, in fact it burns a little. I was surpised at how rough around the edges this beer was."

Aroma is very pilsner like, with those floral hops and a little malt.



Taste reflects the nose, with a little hop bitterness in the finish that is quite nice. It is quick though and obviously doesn't linger. Small malt backbone completes the deal.



Not bad in the mouth and not bad overall. It is what it is; that is, a light pilsner type beer with a refreshing quality but of course it lacks any degree of substance in terms of taste or experience, but it's not really claiming to be anything special.

Massive corn and alcohol aroma.



Mouthfeel? Well, it's carbonated water isn't it?



Warming alcohol is the overpowering ""taste"", burns slightly at the back of the mouth and on the way down. I suppose there is some taste of ""macro beer"" too.



To be honest, this kind of junk is increasingly difficult to swallow (literally and metaphorically). Perhaps that's a sign of age!

Definite aroma of that ""matured in whiskey casks"" type smell, but it is fairly muted. By that, I mean a rich, sweet liquor type aroma the lies on top of the nutty malts in the nose.



Caramel and malts dominate the taste, with sweetness and balanced light hop bitterness coming together to give the feeling of a traditional English pint. Like many similar beers it's best not to drink this straight from the fridge, give it time to release the aroma and tastes for about 45 minutes before enjoying it.



Body lets it down a little bit, slightly too thin for my liking, but holds up OK overall.

Nice and typical head, but this fades disappointingly fast. Minimal lacing.

Also surprisingly, this is a decent looking beer, with a head that has much better retention than most macros, and comes with a little lacing too! Body is golden yellow with not too pale an appearance either. In fact to look at, this is pretty darn good!



OK, after the appearance, then it's not so good, but is far from the worst beer I've ever drunk. The aroma is typical alcohol based macro corn (with the emphasis on the alcohol).

There are some real earthy tones in the nose and in the taste. A real organic feel to the beer. The malts are bready with a little hop bitterness to add bite, freshness and crispness.
I like the balance that this beer produces, and it is refeshing and a bit different. At this ABV I'd suggest this has a lot of potential as a session beer. Nice, with much crossover potential but not worth anywhere near the hype that this often attracts."

Nose is typical with citrus grapefruit notes.



Taste is dry hops, but they don't overtake the beer. A good malt backbone backs up the hops, and although I wouldn't really describe the beer as balanced, the hops are well supported to make it a nice combination.



Mouthfeel has the twang that you would expect. Drinkability is high if hops are your thing, perhaps a little less if your taste requires a less aggressive bitter assault."

ORIGINAL REVIEW 08/31/05



Golden pour with very little head but some nice lacing.



Yeasty apples in the aroma.



Very sweet, yeast based taste (that typical Belgian taste) with an awful lot of sweetness and sugar with some fruits. A tiny bit of spice in there too, but this is overtaken by the candied suagared sticky stuff.



Not sure how this really fits into the authentic Tripel style, but it is a drinkable beer. What I don't like is the distinct apple taste that comes through really strong - in fact to such an extent it begins to taste more like cider.



Tiny hop bite in the finish, but this is quickly overrun by the sweetness. Alcohol is well hidden.



An interesting beer, but truthfully it is a bit hit and miss. It's an odd beer that doesn't really find a true niche as far as the style or the grand scheme of things. Frankly I like the sweetness, but I suspect that others will be less impressed."
Yards Brewing Co.,Extra Special Ale (ESA),,,Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB),6.30%,bottle,2.68,2.5,3,3,2,2,8/31/2005,"Utterly ridiculous carbonation/head that took an eternity to subside and actually spoiled the drinking experience. Lacing was good (eventually) after I had got to a point where the head had susided to a degree to make the lacing visible.



Golden orange pour with a decent hop profile, but this wasn't really very tasty hoppiness, more of a biting bitterness. Seemed very bitter for bitter's sake which was not very enjoyable.



Carbonation and head made a mess of the mouthfeel and the finish was really very metallic and bitter.



Poor drinkability related to the bitterness and the silly carbonation."
Fuller Smith & Turner PLC,Fuller's London Porter,,,English Porter,5.40%,bottle,4.55,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,5,8/30/2005,"Pours dark brown, almost black, with some minimal lacing, but a nice spotty film and some lacing. Solid looking beer.



Mild, cold sweet coffee in the aroma, very reserved, not overpowering and lots of creaminess in the mouthfeel.



Taste reflects the smell; creamed coffee and some light smoke. Slight bitterness in the finish, a classic English Porter feel, reserved but absolutley solid.



This is simply a confident and well established beer, and an excellent example of the style."
Avery Brewing Company,Karma,,,Belgian Pale Ale,5.20%,bottle,2.93,3.5,2.5,3,3,3,8/29/2005,"Well, very odd.
Firstly I would NEVER have guessed that this was supposed to be a Belgian pale. To me it was real thin and watery, with no hint of the spice or yeast. It drank just like a middle of the road American Pale Ale. Nice, drinkable and OK, but simply non-specific. The kind of beer I would expect a competent, small, local brewery to produce as their bog-standard offering.
Maybe I've lost the feel for the regular (non-Strong) Belgian Pales or maybe I've been expecting bigger beers from Avery, or maybe this just isn't are very good example of the style I don't know, but it didn't really hit the spot. I would never have put this down as an Avery offering in a blind taste.
Orange, chill hazed pour with a small head but some very nice lacing (extra 0.5 appearance points for the lacing). Aroma was very non-descript.
Tastes were also non-descript, a little dry and some mild hops, but very, very bland. Mouthfeel decent, but fairly average.
Don't know about this at all, as I said, very strange."
Allagash Brewing Company,Allagash Dubbel Ale,,,Dubbel,7.00%,bottle,4.35,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,8/28/2005,"Typical of the relatively unattractive nature of many Dubbels, this shows a dirty, drab, brown body, but a nice looking head. The head is small but leaves a nice film of lace on the surface, and some additional lace on the St. Bernardus goblet.



Some mixed dark fruits in the aroma, and suprisingly little alcohol. This is a little confusing since it drinks above its 7% ABV, but has an aroma below it.



Very, very smooth with some warming alcohol, a little banana and some tropical pineapple.



Very good mouthfeel and a real good example of the style. Some surprising bitterness in the finish.



Thanks go out to Keelkemper."
Butte Creek Brewing Company,Butte Creek Organic India Pale Ale,,,American IPA,6.70%,bottle,3.88,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,8/27/2005,"Very nice.
Pale orange pour, some reserved head, and a little lacing.
Very easy drinking with a pronounced sweet and mild taste that is followed in the rear by a strong, bitter hop finish. The finish was really quite surprisingly sharp and very nicely bitter.
Mouthfeel and drinkability are solid, with some smooth creamy texture and a drink that leaves you craving at least one more.
Some earthy qualities, a good, solid American version of an IPA - obviously less subtle than the original, but nevertheless enjoyable.
Good ABV, that is nicely balanced to make this a satisfying beer."
Stoudts Brewing Co.,Stoudt's Triple (Belgian Abbey-Style Ale),,,Tripel,9.00%,bottle,3.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,8/27/2005,"Orange/amber body with an ample head that fades quickly (high ABV causes this?) to leave some spotty, creamy film and a little lacing.



Aroma is mainly spiced alcohol and some ripe bananas. Tastes reflect that mix, and this comes across as being pretty sweet. Alcohol is definitely there and upfront and the banana is very evident.



Full and smooth in the mouth, the spice adding a little prickle. Some pepper notes too.



Quite a long finish with the main attribute being the warming alcohol.



Nice US interpretation."
Avery Brewing Company,Maharaja,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,10.30%,bottle,4.65,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,5,8/26/2005,"Originally from mentor as part of BIF #16 phase #3, subsequently from Green's in Atlanta, GA.



In a nutshell this is everything good about the great American obsession with big, hoppy monster IPA's. Great looking orange pour, beautiful citrus grapefruit aroma, immensly satisfying sweet big hops, balanced against a solid malt backbone.



As it warms it gets sweeter and sweeter.



Head and lacing are excellent, it looks great, it tastres great, it IS great.



IPA fan? Double IPA fan? Hophead? Any of the above, you'll love it, as long as you can cope with the sweetness. I love the sweet side of things so it's not a problem for me, but some will find it a little too much I suspect. Big beer - big hit."
Wolnzacher Bürgerbraü AG,Wolnzacher Roggenbier,,,Roggenbier,5.50%,bottle,2.85,1.5,2.5,3.5,3,2,8/25/2005,"Dirty orange pour with a disconcerting amount of nasty looking sediment. I have no problems with bottle-conditioned and unfiltered beers, but when we get to this level of debris swirling around in the glass it really doesn't look at all appetizing. The troubling thing is that the level of carbonation coupled with the size and amount of sediment combine to give a real nasty looking mess in the glass that almost seems to be alive! Huge carbonation on the pour that strangely faded to leave no head or lacing. What's up with that?



Somewhat of an acidic type aroma in there, with only a little rye. Some smokiness in there too which is replicated in the initial tastes.



Pretty light body with a definite citrus lemon twang. Quite a sharp finish but not much bitterness.



Didn't care for this much, looked poor and didn't do much else for me from that starting position."
Carlsberg Danmark A/S,Elephant Beer,,,Euro Strong Lager,7.20%,bottle,2.68,3,2.5,2.5,3,3,8/24/2005,"I have a soft spot for Elephant since nearly twenty years ago I used to think of this as something special. As a poor student who knew better, but would often have to drink low quality macro's at 4-5% ABV, the opportunity to quaff something nearly twice the ABV was always an enjoyable one. Also enjoyed rinking Giraffe at the time too! I seem to remember an earlier incarnation of this beer being sold in England in the late '80's as being higher than the now advertised 7.2 ABV. Anyone know?



Anyway, I digress, back to the beer.



Desperately disappointing on revisiting this. A bland macro type lager with only a few redeeming features. Not skunky, very malty, good ABV and a tiny hop bite in the finish. Outside of that nothing that a BMC couldn't deliver."
Miller Brewing Co.,Miller High Life Light,,,Light Lager,4.50%,bottle,3,3,3,3,3,3,8/24/2005,"Not at all bad - for what it is you understand!



Typical adjunct in most respects, but slightly above average. Scores well in the ""very, very hot summer"" refreshing department, and is a pretty smooth drinking beer that lacks the real nastiness that most beers of its type have. No skunk and a decent thirst quencher.



Of course, that's where the story begins and ends, but this does do well when compared to others of its type, especially in the Light/Lite category.



Take it for what it is, and you probably won't be too disappointed,"
Brasserie de l'Abbaye des Rocs s.a.,Nounette [Brasserie Des Rocs Blonde],,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,7.50%,bottle,4.63,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,8/22/2005,"Nice presentation with the very attractive yellow label.



Poured into the Duvel tulip (which happens to be very appropriate) with a cloudy orange color, a fantastic head and the yeast sediment finishes the pour by dropping on to the white head with a lovely rich, brown ""splat""!



Lots of dry fruits in the yeasty alcoholic aroma and taste. Nice alcohol in the finish.



Massively quaffable, this is a Duvel clone and it's a worthy one!"
Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,Midas Touch Golden Elixir,,,Herbed / Spiced Beer,9.00%,bottle,4.23,3,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,8/22/2005,"Leave it to a progressive brewery like DFH to produce this kind of product.
A golden pour, but with zero lacing and a scant head.
If I had to summarize this I would describe it as a malt liquor with honey added. As unattractive as that may sound this is delicious.
Layered fruits and honey sweetness, this is a really rich beer and one that is guaranteed to wow! Lots and lots of repeated sweet, smooth layers break over the tongue to give a feeling of intense well-being. Nice.
Mouthfeel is luxurious and the drinkability is high despite the punch. A few of these out in the summer sun and you'll be steaming!"
St. Peter's Brewery Co Ltd,St. Peter's English Ale,,,English Pale Ale,4.50%,bottle,4.7,5,4,5,4,5,8/22/2005,"Love the bottle - great presentation. Absolute clarity in the pale orange body with a lovely one inch, full, bone colored head. Beautiful looker with some lovely lacing.



Sweet, grassy aroma that is true to the beers advertised organic pedigree.



Subtle and well crafted beer, a rare combination.



Some mild hop bitterness all the way through the drink. This has great potential as a session beer.



Although this certainly looks like an English Pale Ale, it drinks more like a traditional light bitter and has some striking characteristics that are reminiscent of a fine Cask Ale.



Great job, great beer, St. Peter's continues to produce some real gems."
Bierbrouwerij Sint Christoffel B.V,Christoffel Robertus,,,Munich Dunkel Lager,6.00%,bottle,3.43,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,8/21/2005,"Nice pop on the release of the swing top. Pour leads to a bit of drab looking red brown body, but a nice head and some lacing.



Aroma is fairly non-descript except some sweet alcohol. A tiny bit of sherry, but it's sort of watered down. Not bad, but not really very distinct.



Tastes are certainly malt based, but they are fairly reserved. Lots of sweetness but this is tempered by the lack of body.



Mouthfeel a little thin. Some lingering alcohol and fruitiness in the finish.



Slightly disappointing because this has huge potential but is lacking something. It's a winner in waiting."
Der HirschBrau/Privatbrauerei Höss,Doppel-Hirsch,,,Doppelbock,7.20%,bottle,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,8/20/2005,"Slightly disappointing lack of ""pop"" to the swing top bottle, but pours to give a beautiful red brown body and a small tan head. Very little lacing.
Big dark malts and some caramel make up the aroma.
Definitely a more organic, earthy feel to this Doppelbock, with much less of the candied, sugared feel that often accompanies these beers.
Slightly metallic in the mouth with a pronounced bitterness in the finish. I wouldn't go as far to describe this as thin in the mouth, but it is fairly light drinking.
A bit unusual, and worth a try, but seems a little out of character for the style?"
Latrobe Brewing Co.,Rolling Rock Extra Pale,,,American Adjunct Lager,4.60%,bottle,2.08,2.5,1.5,2,2.5,2.5,8/20/2005,"Rolling Rock is one of those beers that I'm going to reach for ONLY as a result of being in a bar when the selection is nothing more than macro swill fare.



OK, so fair enough, we know what we're getting here, an ultra bland macro with little or no characteristics outside of being wet and mildly alcoholic. There really is very little else to report other than a distinct adjunct corn flavor and a very, very mild hop bite somewhere near the finish.



However, it drinks fairly clean, lacks any nasty skunk, and can be refreshing when the heat of Atlanta gets to its most intense. Outside of that we have nothing here other than what you would expect. Neutral aroma, taste and character."
Privatbrauerei Franz Inselkammer KG / Brauerei Aying,Ayinger Jahrhundert Bier,,,Dortmunder / Export Lager,5.50%,bottle,4.05,5,4,4,4,4,8/20/2005,"As many others have mentioned, this is an incredibly good looking beer, with the color and clarity being close to perfect. I see a lot of other reviewers have suggested ""straw"" as the color. I saw a yellow/green color, almost like a pale lime green. Good pillow like head.



Some biscuit yeast and malt in the aroma.



Very smooth drinking and plenty of malt balance.



Very refreshing with plenty of smooth bitterness in the finish."
Red Brick Brewing Company,Red Brick Blonde,,,American Blonde Ale,5.70%,bottle,3.55,3.5,3,3.5,4,4,8/19/2005,"Pretty pale Pilsner type appearance with a small head that disappears to leave some decent lacing and some surface cream. Carbonation is good and ""tops up"" the surface head nicely.



Some fruit acid type character or pepper in the aroma.



Interesting tastes that lie somewhere in the Pilsner/Cream Ale range. Definite initial dry hop bitterness, but this fades quickly to give a creamy dryness in the finish. Finish is quite long and there is a pronounced dry/bitter aftertaste. A little malt in the background but not at all large.



Crisp, drinkable and quite thirst quenching.



Mouthfeel is smooth, not large, but has a nice edge to it."
"Wild Goose Brewery, LLC",Blue Ridge Subliminator Dopplebock,,,Doppelbock,7.30%,bottle,4,4,4,4,3,4.5,8/19/2005,"Very nice Doppelbock, true to the style. Typical orange red/brown pour with that orangey/yellow dense and creamy head, so typical of a good DB.



Aroma is obviously very malty with some fruit presence and a little alcohol. In terms of alcohol it drinks a lot bigger than the 7.3% listed.



Malt dominates the taste (of course), good alcohol too and some ripe round fruits, mainly plums. Candied sugar is there too.



Mouthfeel is slightly under-par for a Doppelbock (a little thin), but that did not significantly detract from the enjoyment. High drinkability for the malt lover, a very nice offering.



Thanks to Higravity."
Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,90 Minute IPA,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,9.00%,bottle,4.75,4,4,5,5,5,8/16/2005,"Golden hazed pour with orange highlights, slightly lighter than I was expecting with a small head and some, but not a great deal, of lacing. What lacing is produced is sticky. Aroma is not the huge hop bomb that you may think, in fact it's quite sweet.
A lot of bitterness in the large hop profile, but it's perfectly balanced in the beer. One of the few examples of a very large beer that is wonderfully crafted with grace and skill.
A little bit of pine, a little bit of citrus, a little bit of oily hop presence are all there in the tastes, but they all mesh with one another perfectly; nothing is overpowering and they meld together to produce a richness and a drinkability seldom found in a beer with this kind of hop-profile and size. Sweetness comes through again, as does that distinct DFH character which for me at least, is some kind of unique hop and yeast combo - difficult to put my finger on it but definitely very obviously DFH.
Mouthfeel is close to perfect, with lots of tingling hop character, some dryness and a malt backbone completing the experience and holding up the hops nicely.
The 60, 90 and the 120 are an exceptional family of beers from this exceptional brewery."
Brasserie d'Achouffe,N'Ice Chouffe,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,10.00%,bottle,3.95,4,4,4,3.5,4,8/14/2005,"2004 Vintage.



Dark brown pour, but not so deep that a real deep mahogany type body was evident, with nice spotty lacing on the surface of the beer and on the glass.



A lot of malt and spice in the aroma. Detected some orange peel (as advertised), but the others were more difficult to detect and definitely not as deep and rich as some other Belgians of the same ilk - a little more reserved here, with the emphasis on the spice rather than the fruit.



Bitter, dry finish with a OK mouthfeel, but again, not as full as some others. Alcohol is well masked until the end when it bites pretty hard.



This is a slightly different feel for a Belgian dark and I prefer the fruitier, richer versions to the spiced. However, still very nice and very drinkable and definitely a good beer."
Coors Brewing Company,Coors Light,,,Light Lager,4.20%,bottle,1.5,1.5,1,1.5,1.5,2,8/12/2005,"This is an absolutely extraordinary product. Quite LITERALLY no aroma (I was tempted to give it a 5 for ""exceptional"") and very close to no taste. All that there is a slight bitter finish which lets you know that this is not just very, very cold club soda.



I'm assuming that this is what the ""brewer"" is trying to achieve. It must be quite difficult to do if you are starting with malt and hops. My question is, ""Are they starting with malt and hops??""



Extremely pale yellow color, with zero head after the first 25 seconds. Certainly very cold, and would be most welcome after several hours of herding livestock in the desert, but outside of that scenario I see no point in consuming it. I assume that there are quite literally millions of people that consume this on a regular basis in the USA alone, what any of those people would think of a beer with ANY kind of taste is really alarming. It might provoke a riot!



This is an astonishing beverage, I wish I could sell as much of a product that basically is water, as Coors."
Max Lager's American Grill & Brewery,Max Cream,,,Cream Ale,?,on-tap,4.23,4.5,4,4,4,5,8/12/2005,"Currently this is called Max Amber Cream Ale, rather than just ""Cream"", but I was assured it was the same beer.



Beautiful looking pint, golden and a large 1 inch head that showed excllent retention.



Some spicy, hop character that really reminded me of a simple, lightly hopped IPA. Very drinkable and very refreshing. A little aggresive, prickly carbonation adds to the mix to make a very good brewpub beer."
Max Lager's American Grill & Brewery,Max Pale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),?,on-tap,3.78,4,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,8/12/2005,"As others have noted, the aroma was better than the taste, not that the taste wasn't good, it just didn't quite come up to the expectation that the smell suggested.



Very solid appearance, burned orange color with a really good sized, well retained head and some lacing. Definite citrus aroma and initial bitterness, but this fades to give a less aggressive character later in the pint.



Hop bitterness is light, which makes the beer a little less satisfying than it initially promises from the IPA, but definitely a solid example of the style."
"Anheuser-Busch, Inc.",Bud Ice,,,American Adjunct Lager,5.50%,bottle,1.95,2,2,2,1.5,2,8/10/2005,"Almost colorless, with a hint of extremely diluted golden color when poured into a pilsner glass. Aroma is difficult to pin down, but it reminds me of the days when I was working in bars and I would go in on a Sunday morning to start the cleaning up process and everything would be covered in that sickly, sweet, sticky alcoholic smell of spilled and stale beer.
This is very sweet, with a very short bitter snap of a finish that does not linger at all, but leaves behind the residue sweetness. Obviously the sweetness and the bitterness appear to owe nothing to malt or hops, and there is a distinct feeling of a manufactured beer taste. Lacing? Well if you call a nasty sticky residue that almost etches the glass lacing, then yes there is a little.
Mouthfeel not as clean as some macros because of the sweetness that is present.
Some dry cider tastes linger in the mouth after consumption.
Very drinkable up to about three bottles. After that you get the very distinct feeling that you are going to be woken up with the most horrific chemical hangover."
Coors Brewing Company,Coors,,,American Adjunct Lager,5.00%,bottle,2.38,3.5,2.5,2,3,2.5,8/9/2005,"Above average looking (at least for the 45 seconds or so that the head lasts), aroma of sweet alcohol and a slightly stale cereal. No lacing, some bubbles rising in the glass. Some skunk in the aroma too.



Taste is fairly straightforward, clean with no frills, with the exception of a harsh, bitter metallic finish. No hops here, just bitterness.



Not the worst macro on the block, just about par for the course."
Great Divide Brewing Company,Yeti Imperial Stout,,,Russian Imperial Stout,9.50%,bottle,4.08,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,8/9/2005,"Genuine, thick black appearance with a small tan head, and a little lacing - not much, but some. Alcohol and toasted malts make up the majority of the aroma.



I was pleased to find that this wasn't mega-complex. That may sound strange to some, but I was glad that the beer really was simply a really nice, strong stout. Sometimes brewers get into the habit of trying to produce something that is way too complicated, this didn't.



Smoothness and strength are the key descriptors here. There are a lot of burned malts which are layered on top with the alcohol and some sweetness, but that disappears quickly to give a bitter, but short finish.



Mouthfeel is good, with a little pricky carbonation to add to the experience and some warming qualities in the mouth.



You're not going to drink much of this in a sitting, but then again it's not designed for that.



Quality product, to the point and solid."
Avery Brewing Company,The Reverend,,,Quadrupel (Quad),10.00%,bottle,3.95,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,8/6/2005,"Poured into the Chimay goblet.
Light amber, crystal clear pour with a nice head that disappears quickly to leave a spotty, creamy reminder. I don't pick up any really distinct aroma other than the obvious alcohol and general fruitiness of the esters.
It is sweet, but there is also a distinct ""Belgianness"" about this beer, perhaps due to the types of yeasts used. Considering the ABV this has a very light mouthfeel. There is a bitter, hoppy, sharp, high alcohol finish, the hoppiness of which surprised me.
There is definitely a higher hop character than one would expect in a ""Belgian, Belgian"", but this beer pulls off an interesting hybrid between the higher hopped American styles and the authentic European interpretation of a Quad. Slightly unusual, slightly out of traditional style, but I enjoyed it. Interesting."
Stone Brewing Co.,Stone Old Guardian Barley Wine Style Ale 2005,,,American Barleywine,11.30%,bottle,3.8,4,4,4,4,3,8/4/2005,"Pale orange, almost peach colored pour, with a very attractive slightly orange tinted head that comes from the aggresive pour. Of course, the head is small and doesn't last long, but that's to be expected with the ABV.



Typical AMERICAN Barley Wine, and I increasingly feel, that when you get to this level of ABV it can start to get difficult (even for an excellent brewer like Stone) to start making distinguishing charateristics.



Lots of warming alcohol in the taste, you can feel it going down, but outside of that not a huge amount to distinguish it from lots of other good quality BW's.



Yes, it's an excellent example, but not a stunner. Good hop character that hangs well against the alcohol and the sweetness, in fact rather well balanced, but of course, it's a sipper more than anything else.



Good, slightly oily, slick mouthfeel but drinkability is not huge, largely because of the the alcohol and the style."
Brasserie de l'Abbaye des Rocs s.a.,Abbaye Des Rocs [Brasserie Des Rocs Brune],,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,9.00%,bottle,3.55,1.5,3.5,4.5,2.5,2.5,7/31/2005,"Amazing beer and difficult to review. Firstly the good stuff.
This is classically Belgian dark in that it gives layer after layer of dark, alcoholic fruit overtones in the nose and the taste, and ends with a sharp alcohol bite that only really comes out of beers from this country. I love the deep satisfying body of this beer and its ability to let you know that you are drinking something serious. Plums and other very ripe fruits dominate, but in places it appears as if the fruits have gone a little too far in their maturation process - there's a little bit of rotting vegetation in there and some stench around the edges of the aroma.
Then there is the appearance! WOW. On the second pouring huge globules of God knows what fall into the glass. I'm a pretty experienced drinker and I've seen all kinds of yeast based sediment fall into beer before - usually enhancing the appearance and the taste of a brew - but this truly looked utterly disgusting. The only way I could accurately describe it was that it looked like hundreds of small pieces of soggy toilet tissue! The beer literally took on the appearance of something that had failed to flush a couple of times! NASTY. The odd thing was, the beer seemed almost alive, with the sediment refusing to settle for about fifteen minutes. When it had settled, any small agitation - like trying to drink it - caused this amazing circulation of solids that was truly disgusting.
The first glass from the 750 mL bottle was only slightly affected by this problem, the second was nearly impossible to consume. Eventually I gave up with it.
Now, I don't know what that stuff was - it certainly wasn't normal yeast type sediment as I have experienced it in the past, and perhaps something odd had occurred in the bottle - but it took the beer from being a great one to something that simply confused me. Most probably coagulated proteins."
Great Divide Brewing Company,Old Ruffian Barley Wine,,,American Barleywine,10.20%,bottle,4.45,4,4,5,4,4,7/31/2005,"Beautiful clarity in the pour, with a mahogany color and a small but perfectly formed head.



Deep fruitiness and malt backbone really belies the fact that this is both a Barley Wine and a hoppy one at that. It's really a complex beer with the hoppiness, alcohol, malts and fruit all complimenting one another in layered rushes.



Just when you think that you've got a handle on where this beer lies in the style range, it's up and at you from a different angle. Refreshing, then biting, then fruity, then dry, then intense, then soft malts, the list goes on.



One of the most complex American brews I can ever remember tasting and somehow, remarkably, it all comes together to give good drinkability and a smoothness that is uncharacteristic for such a big ABV beer in the (American BW) style."
Stone Brewing Co.,Arrogant Bastard Ale,,,American Strong Ale,7.20%,bottle,4.73,4.5,4,5,4.5,5,7/31/2005,"Utterly delicious with the perfect combination of a sweet start and a hop finish.



The pour is dark brown with great clarity and a lovely half-inch of solid looking head. Lots of sticky lacing. Lovely, almost orange colored head. Aroma's are hops, but not too large and they intice you into a gulping of the first few inches in the glass.



Refreshing, tasty and satisfying, this stuff slips down with an alarming ease. The alcohol is obviously there, but compliments the rest of the attributes perfectly to produce a beer that is getting close to perfection.



Mouthfeel is superb, with the cold hops mingling on the tongue with the fruitiness of the malt to give a drinkability that is very, very good. Alcohol can creep up on you here which is typical of a beer that is so drinkable.



Edit 12/21/05: Not as clear as I remember, a little more cloudy."
Stone Brewing Co.,Stone IPA (India Pale Ale),,,American IPA,6.90%,bottle,4.43,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,7/31/2005,"In many ways this is my favorite Stone beer. It may not score as highly as say, IRS, Ruination or either of the Bastards, but the whole point is that this a simple, everyday beer that doesn't need any kind of huge hop presence or massive alcohol content to stand on its own and say, ""I'm a great example of simple, excellent brewing"".



Classic orange marmalade and hazy pour, with lovely light head and some sticky lacing. Aroma and initial tastes are obviously West Coast hops, but they are loose and not overpowering. Plenty of swwetness in the nose too, and the floral character of the hops and the sugar sweetness combine to make this a real stunner.



A beer that has the confidence to say, ""Yes I have plenty of hop character, but I have the strength to hold my own without becoming gimmicky.""



Lovely citrus refreshment, but it's light and crisp at the same time to give this a drinkability akin to a Pilsner in high summer. Finishes bitter, but short and sweet, not burning. A little light pineapple in the finish. Alcohol is hardly to anywhere to be seen. This drinks much light than 6.90%.



Fantastic, delicious and a great, great example of how to brew beer with serious hop character and bitterness, but backed up by strong malts in a subtle way. Stone rocks!"
Unibroue,Blanche De Chambly,,,Witbier,5.00%,bottle,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,7/31/2005,"Classic Witbier pour, with a lovely well carbonated head and classic clairty in the body. A little light on the color, which is then reflected in the rest of the beers' attributes.



I found this a little too light and under-spiced for the style. With that slight insipid character came some acidity that took points away from taste and drinkability. Light cloves and lemon are there, but not in way that gives the refreshing character that I was looking for.



Despite not being the best Wit, it still holds up pretty well in the grand scheme of things, and like most Unibroue products it represents excellent value and a solid, if not spectacular choice. If you want good value solid drinking then this would suit, if you're looking for a Wit with character and style then there are better alternatives out there."
Great Divide Brewing Company,Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout,,,Russian Imperial Stout,9.50%,bottle,3.58,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,7/30/2005,"Oak-aged to add vanilla notes? Well, vanilla is too subtle a flavor to pick up in this massive beer, and to be frank, I don't see much difference between this and the regular Yeti.



Classic opaque pour with a small head (I assume because of the ABV) and all the classic burned, roasted overtones in the aroma.



Lots of chocolate and coffee in the tastes, but the main taste is the lingering licorice finish. Quite smooth until the end when the bitter finish kicks in.



Alcohol is very well hidden, but the beer is clearly large. I was surprised at the relative thin mouthfeel and the lack of tongue coating that I got.



Not a huge advantage to the oak-aged version and I'd be just as happy with the original."
Brouwerij De Ranke,De Ranke XX Bitter,,,Belgian IPA,6.20%,bottle,4.45,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,7/28/2005,"Beautiful golden yellow pour with a typically large, billowing Belgian head and superb lacing.



I was rather surprised at the citrus notes being so prominent, especially the grapefruit overtones. The grapefruit was pronounced and had the effect of making the beer very crisp and refreshing.



Body was lighter than I was anticipating, and mouthfeel was light and dry. The finish was short, but hoppy. Hops are unusually up front for the style.



This was really unusual for the style and I think I was caught off-guard when I tried it for the first time. I'd like to go back and re-visit this one to see where it sits with me."
Rome Street Tavern Grill,Carrollton Ale,,,American Blonde Ale,?,on-tap,1.9,2,2,2,2,1.5,7/19/2005,"Hazy, cloudy pour with a small head that left quickly. A lot of unidentified particles (yeast?) at the bottom of the glass.



Amazingly strong aroma of apples, and an acidic taste led me to believe that this was more like a rustic English cider. In the end it resembled some kind of weird hybrid of cider, saison, wit and hefe, and was just about as far removed from the Pilsner label that the brewer had put on it that you could imagine.



Watery mouthfeel, and a lingering acidicly bitter aftertaste. Not good.



To be fair this is the very first offering from the brewpub and, given time maybe things will improve. I am happy to wait and see, but this was a pretty bad start."
Rome Street Tavern Grill,Summer Wallop,,,Irish Dry Stout,?,on-tap,2.53,2,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,7/19/2005,"For a start this is nowhere near a stout. On the beer menu it is described as ""like Guinness"", but that is simply not true in any respect.



Alarmingly like the Carrollton Ale (http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/11659/24834/?ba=Ding) this beer also has a strong apple/acid aroma and taste. However the Summer Wallop does have some redeeming malt backbone which makes it slightly more drinkable and adds sweetness.



Drab brown color, with a lack of clarity, this is not an attractive pint, but it does have potential. Mouthfeel was average, but on closer inspection the body was missing and it was hardly in the brown ale category, let alone the stouts.



This brewpub clearly is at the beginning of a very long road, but the very fact that it exists at all in this part of the world is a minor miracle. I hope things improve, and this beer has the potential to be at least a decent staple. It's not there yet, but I shall continue to monitor progress."
Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),Samuel Smith's Old Brewery Pale Ale,,,English Pale Ale,5.00%,bottle,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,7/19/2005,"Beautiful crystal clear copper colored pour, with a small off-white head and some lacing. Soft, sweet malts dominate what little aroma there is. The aroma, of course, improves with warming.



Very malty all the way through which is not necessarily out of character for an English Pale Ale that tend to (with the exception of the IPA's) steer slightly away from the hop emphasis we see so often in the USA.



Lovely smooth drink with a wonderful cream/bitter lingering finish and aftertaste. Also immensely refreshing.



Drinkability is exceptional, with a classic English bitter feel benefitting from the more relaxed maltiness of the Pale Ale. A great everyday drinker. Delicious."
Old Dominion Brewing Co.,Dominion Oak Barrel Stout,,,American Stout,5.20%,bottle,4.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,7/18/2005,"Apparently black body with a small tan head and a little lacing. On holding to strong light some dark ruby red highlights come through. 



A little smokiness in the aroma, but the taste is sweet with the vanilla just pushing through a little. The combination of sweet vanilla and the oak smokiness make this a stout with a really good body, but at the same time quite light. As a result its drinkability is pretty high.



Nice lingering , balanced sweet and bitter finish.



Nice example, slightly different, a refreshing change."
Little Yeoman Brewery,Little Yeoman Stout,,,Milk / Sweet Stout,5.00%,bottle,3.78,4,4,3.5,4,4,7/17/2005,"Very good appearance, solid black, but a disappointingly small head.



Aromas are chocolate and some burnt malt. Roasted and toasted come to mind. Aromas a reflected in the tastes. Some bitterness in the finish.



Mouthfeel is very nice, with good levels of carbonation and a smooth feeling on the way down.



Drinkable, if not spectacular - a nice example."
Williams Brothers Brewing Company,Fraoch Heather Ale,,,Scottish Gruit / Ancient Herbed Ale,5.00%,bottle,4.48,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,7/17/2005,"I approached this with some trepidation, half expecting some floral experience that I wouldn't like, or perhaps some very weird flavors that wouldn't sit well at all, but I was very pleasantly surprised.
What I got was essentially something that looked, smelled and drank very much like a bitter shandy (half English Bitter, half English lemonade).
Muted hop and sweet flavors combined, with a pretty dry finish to give a very unusual and refreshing combination.
Light orange color (of diluted dark bitter), with a nice level of carbonation and decent head.
Very refreshing and drinkable. Good summer quencher."
Flying Dog Brewery,Gonzo Imperial Porter,,,Baltic Porter,7.80%,bottle,2.95,4.5,4,2.5,3,2.5,7/15/2005,"This gives me some things that I really like in a Porter, and some things that I don't. I prefer my Porters to exhibit a mild, creamy overall experience with a classic black appearance and a smooth texture. The appearance criteria are nicely fulfilled by this brew - a jet black body, small tan head with a little lacing, but that's where the Porter style is left behind and the beer then departs on some wild hop extravaganza. Fine if you like beers that get hopped out of the style, but less appealing if you are looking for a classic.
No doubt that this is an interesting brew - a hopped up, supercharged Porter - but as is so often the case when classic styles and beers are treated this way, a lot of the original charm, sophistication and intent are lost. Shame really, because this *could* be an amazing Porter in the true sense of the style, but it falls into the mega-beer trap.
Alcohol is too large for the beer, but having said that quite well hidden. Bitterness abounds, and that's not what I'm looking for here."
Little Yeoman Brewery,Little Yeoman Porter,,,American Porter,?,bottle,3.98,3.5,4,4,4,4,7/15/2005,"Nicely put together package.



Somewhat murky brown appearance, but a nice head, good nose and initial tastes, and a perfect level of carbonation combine to make this Porter a very drinkable example.



Some chocolate in there, but mainly dark malts that make the beer sweet enough to be noticed, but not so much that it takes over the brew. A bitter sweet balance is struck. 



Mouthfeel is nice, and a satisfying finish completes the deal."
"Bell's Brewery, Inc.",Bell's Java Stout,,,American Double / Imperial Stout,7.50%,bottle,2.8,4,4.5,2,4,2,7/14/2005,"Well, I love coffee and I love beer, so I thought this would probably work out OK, but not so.



Another example of a beer that is simply taken to an extreme which overwhelms any possible subtlety or finess. Don't get me wrong, I love a big beer, but this isn't really big, it's just cold, sweet, incredibly strong alcoholic black coffee.



The coffee taste totally takes over any hop bitterness to such an extent that the sweetness that I assume is coming from the malt backbone, just tastes like sugar.



Mouthfeel is good, and the appeaance is jet black, but with no head. Very nice aroma, but the taste is simply too strong for the beer. Alcohol is hidden, but only by the massive mouthful of sweetened coffee grinds that I get.



Too extreme to be enjoyable for me."
Yards Brewing Co.,General Washington's Tavern Porter,,,English Porter,7.00%,bottle,2.58,3,3,2.5,2,2.5,7/13/2005,"Not too keen on this.



Light brown appearance, too much carbonation leading to a massive head and a distinct acidic sourness to it that reminded me of a badly (home)brewed brown ale.



Very little Porter character in there, a very pronounced lack of creaminess and a bit of a struggle to finish.



Mouthfeel and body were both seriously lacking - a disappointing effort at the style. Alcohol well hidden.



A sour experience was the abiding memory."
North Coast Brewing Co.,Old #38 Stout,,,Irish Dry Stout,5.60%,bottle,3.93,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,7/11/2005,"Bit of any odd beast this one, but enjoyable nonetheless. Lots of red highlights in the pour makes this a very ""non-stout"" looking stout. In fact its look is hardly up to Porter standards, to me it resembles more of a Brown Ale. Head is very small too and there is very little lacing. No evidence of a solid head that I would like to see in the style.



Carbonation is also a little high. This is a sweet malty beer, especially in the long finish and there is plenty of chocolate in there too. These facets are present in both the aroma and in the taste. Lack of real hop bitterness coming through, again takes it a little out of style.



Light, easy drinking and rather nice, but not a classically moulded stout. Sort of stradles the gap between Porter, Stout and Brown Ale, with the emphasis on the Brown Ale. having said that I still enjoyed drinking it."
Ceylon / Lion Brewery Limited,Lion Lager,,,Euro Pale Lager,4.80%,bottle,2.15,2,2,2,1.5,3,7/10/2005,"Drinkable, but instantly forgetable. Nothing to report here except a very, very light, sweet (malty) lager with no head or lacing to speak of that could be any one of one thousand other beers.



Nothing to bring me back for any reason.



Taco Mac in Douglasville, GA charged me $5.95 for the privelage! Daylight robbery."

Very red/copper color, with a small but beautiful head, some light lacing and served in the correct glassware this looks like a dream.



Very, very complex. I get so many contrasting sensations I find it very hard to categorize and list them. Alcohol is there, so is deep fruit character, at the same time a creaminess and bitter finish. Some chocolate, a little smoke, the list goes on. In order to pin all of these down I'd need to come back to this again and again. Luckily I'll be glad to do so.



Typically Belgian Dark in it's complexity, this is a truly fantastic beer.



Despite all the layers this is remarkably drinkable and did not overwhelm me. In fact, considering the depth and the ABV this was amazingly easy to quaff - dangerously so! Alcohol is very, very well masked.



Simply a great beer."
Coopers Brewery Limited,Coopers Best Extra Stout,,,Foreign / Export Stout,6.30%,bottle,4.15,3,4.5,4,4,4.5,7/7/2005,"Jet black pour with a disappointing head and not much lacing. Lots and lots of sediment, a little too much for my liking in this style. For whatever reason, the sediment in the jet black body looks slightly off-putting (perhaps that's the Guinness perfect pint syndrome).



Aroma is very sweet, with some coffee and a little chocolate. I suspect that the aroma would be too much for some people, but I like the sweet malt nose.



Tastes are bitter sweet, with a decent bite in the lingering finish.



Mouthfeel is very light and refreshing, really rather mild and unusual for a stout but I enjoyed it. The lightness in the mouth did not detract from the enjoyment, if anything it added to it.



Pretty good overall, a light drinking stout, but at the same time tasty and satisfying. I'd go back."
Harpoon Brewery,Harpoon Winter Warmer,,,Winter Warmer,5.50%,bottle,3.63,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,7/4/2005,"Nice, if somewhat reserved Winter Warmer.



Pour is standard, with a decent red/brown color, nice head and a little lacing. 



Mouthfeel and body are both pretty light, and I found the spices really rather reserved. Unlike some of this style, this is a beer you could comfortably drink year round. Not heavy at all.



Smell is also laid back with not much in your face spice, rather just some in the background.



Not sure if this is a great example of the style (the WW's are usually much more robust) but I enjoyed it."
Chili Beer Co.,Crazy Ed's Cave Creek Chili Beer,,,Chile Beer,4.20%,bottle,1,1,1,1,1,1,7/3/2005,"Well, you HAVE to try it once. World Market here in the Atlanta area is selling six packs of this stuff! Luckily, they also sell singles, this one cost me $1.49. For that price I thought I should at least say I'd been there, done that!
This is easy to review. I suppose this stuff must have been brewed as ""beer"", but the chili overwhelms everything, to make it essentially alcoholic water with tabasco sauce added. No point in discussing head, color, lacing, aroma, mouthfeel etc. as there are no characteristics other than the burning heat of the chili pepper sitting in the urine colored liquid. I love spicy food, but this is a total write-off. Down the drain it went, drinkability should be zero!
Still, by all means try it for yourself, but it's gonna be unlikely that you manage to consume one, let alone any more than that.
Good stuff for practical jokes, drinking games and Stag do's (bachelor parties)."
Coastal Extreme Brewing Co.,Newport Storm - Alyssa (Cyclone Series),,,American Brown Ale,7.90%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,7/3/2005,"Well, this is one of those beers that is difficult to review for me because I think it is not really within the traditional parameters of the style, but I still quite enjoyed it. So, not worrying about it too much, I'm going to comment on the drink itself, rather than its stylistic attributes.



Unattractive label, but attractive beer. Deep brown with a good head. Some slight smoke in the aroma.



To me this thing drinks more like a fruity Belgian Strong Ale. There's a mess of fruity esters upfront and some strong alcohol too. Good thick mouthfeel and a nice, but small, bitter finish.



Brown Ale? Not so sure, but a pretty interesting beer. I'm not sure if the brewer go what they intended here, but it's a pretty drinkable ale nonetheless. Sort of a nice mess!"
Founders Brewing Company,Founders Black Rye,,,Rye Beer,6.60%,bottle,3.48,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,7/3/2005,"OK, but not much more than average for me.



Dark, Porter like pour that promises a rich experience but comes up a little short. Good size tan head with some nice lacing.



Mouthfeel lacked body. Some hop bitterness comes through but it sits against the back-drop of thin feeling brew.



This was on the brink of being a really nice beer, but fell a bit short for me, leaving me somewhat unsatisfied. Neede more malty a body to balance the rye promise.



In terms of Rye, if you get a chance try either of these;

New Holland Brewing Company,New Holland Mad Hatter India Pale Ale,,,American IPA,5.30%,bottle,3.63,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,7/3/2005,"Big, big, bitter hops up front and continuing all the way through with this beer.



Light orange color with a lingering hop nose and taste. Good lacing but not much residual head.



This is really a bitter hop based IPA with little or no balance from malt. This takes it out of my comfort range for IPA's and certainly makes it typically American in the style where the tendancy continues to be away from malt balance, toward the more extreme end of the hop/IPA scale. This is certainly not the worst offender (it's not a Rogue beer), but it's a little too much for my taste.



Outside of that, a decent oily mouthfeel and a certain drinkability make this a nice, if not spectacular drink."
Two Brothers Brewing Company,Heavy Handed IPA,,,American IPA,6.70%,bottle,4.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,7/3/2005,"Huge rocky head that was slightly annoying as I tried to pour the beer, but did look great.



Sweet hop aroma, defintely on the oily, grassy, organic side of things. Light, but extremely distinct.



Sweetened grapefruit taste, although not as heavily sweet as a Stoudt's DIPA for example, but still very enjoyable.



Smooth, sweet finish with a nice hop kick in the end. Very nice example of how a heavily hopped beer can be kept drinkable with some balance."
Black Sheep Brewery PLC,Riggwelter Yorkshire Ale,,,English Brown Ale,5.70%,bottle,4.23,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,7/2/2005,"Amazing clarity, with a crystal clear, deep amber/red body, a lovely head and excellent lacing.



Nose is very malty. In fact, very malty all the way through, but not with an overbearing sweetness, more of a creamy malt.



There is an unusual combination of malt with the sweet, plus an overall dry experience. This beer drinks very easily with a dry finish too.



Mouthfeel is very nice, with mildly sweet creams coming to mind.



Highly drinkable."
Coopers Brewery Limited,Coopers Sparkling Ale,,,English Pale Ale,5.80%,bottle,4.1,4,4.5,4,4,4,7/2/2005,"Pale orange appearance, but throw in the sediment from the bottle conditioning and you get something that more resembles a cloudy Wit. Small head that doesn't really hang around.



Interesting aroma of honey and alcohol, really quite nice.



A little sting from the carbonation, which seems high, and from some hop bitterness, but it smooths out pretty quickly to be an easy drink.



Mouthfeel is OK but the carbonation is a little OTT and the finish is dry with some bitterness.



Malt balance is in there, and above average score for me. Quite refreshing."
"Boon Rawd Brewery Co., Ltd",Singha,,,Euro Pale Lager,5.00%,bottle,2.93,2.5,3,3,2.5,3,6/30/2005,"Like a succession of Asian inspired/rooted macro lagers, this is very unremarkable, but at the same time pretty unoffensive too.



There is very little to report about many of these beers - standard macro lager appearance and pour, with little or no head that fades quickly to nothing. Mainly pale golden to golden in color, quite refreshing, sometimes a little skunk, but still drinkable as a lawnmower.



Singha is often presented as a premium lager at a premium price which is laughable, and as a result it is usually overpriced, but ignoring that fact I can still live with a couple every once in a while."

Distinct cream soda in the nose, a definite sweetness comes out of the glass - not huge, but noticeable.



Light, easy drinking with that obvious sweetness for the style and a little hop bitterness (but not much) in the finish. Mouthfeel a little creamy and above average.



Very drinkable and a decent example of the (relatively) unusual style."
Brauerei Heller-Trum / Schlenkerla,Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Märzen,,,Rauchbier,5.40%,bottle,2.28,3.5,2,2,4,2,6/29/2005,"Well, it's obviously an acquired taste, and it's going to take some people by surprise, but this simply isn't to my liking.



Nice appearance - solid brown ale, with a small head that fades fast.



The aroma is very strong - definitely like a very highly smoked ham. The initial tastes reflect this, but the finish is both dry and loses the ""meat"" aspect and ends up just being smoke! Not very appealing.



I would imagine that if you dislike smoke at all this really is going to be a beer to avoid.



Mouthfeel is pretty good, but the drinkability and taste are overwhelmed by the smoke.



If and when you do drink this I would definitely recommend consuming it with food. Something hearty as well to help take the edge off the whole experience. I suppose some good solid German fare would be in order, but offal might be an option too!"

http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/224/698/?ba=Ding



I was very disappointed with this. Lifeless and pretty tasteless was the overall verdict, with little to endear it to me. In fact, it had macro junk stamped all over it.



Pale appearance, slightly skunked and that odd combination of being over carbonated but unable to hold its head, this gave a grain/corn aroma and the same in the initial tastees.



Mouthfeel below average and a sharp ending completed the package. Is it the worse I've ever drunk? Certainly not, but very disappointing in terms of the style and the beer in general."
Rogue Brewery (Brewer's on the Bay),XS Imperial India Pale Ale,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,9.50%,bottle,2.6,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,6/27/2005,"I'm going to go against the grain here - for the usual reasons - and say I don't much care for this, but more importantly for the price there are several other examples of better beers within the style. I feel that Rogue often ""hops"" out of a style to the point where the citrus hop bitterness just leaves you feeling that that is all you are getting, and some of the finer points are lost. I KNOW that some people love that route, I just feel they often overstep the mark.



Very cloudy orange/yellow pour, this brew looks more like a Wit than an IPA (of any description). Small frothy head, with some lacing. Aroma is not overpowering in terms of hops, but is noticeably sweet.



Stinging acid grapefruit twang is the overwhelming taste sensation and this simply doesn't give way. I suppose this is what the brewer is trying to achieve, but I think it's at the expense of other aspects that should feature a little more in the style.



Fairly syrupy mouthfeel too - not clean or refreshing in a way that some other IPA's can be.



If you want a hop bomb, then go for it, otherwise try Stoudt's DIPA - cheaper and better."
"Tsingtao Brewery Co., Ltd.",Tsingtao,,,American Adjunct Lager,4.80%,bottle,3.18,2,3,3.5,3,3,6/27/2005,"Not bad for what it is. 



I think that (along with Bud light) this may be the beer that has the least amount of color that I have ever encountered. It really does look like ""frightened water"". The usual silly, wispy head that instantly disappears accompanies the pale, plae body



However, having said that it did fufil my own criteria of a macro/adjunct lager, by not being skunked to any extent; being relatively refreshing (in a lawnmower, Atlanta summer day) kind of way; and by not having a taste that was obnoxious. Certainly sweeter than many others of the same ilk, and I like that, with a little pseudo hop bitterness and dry bite in the finish."

Good solid beer, with some bitterness that runs all the way through from start to finish. I didn't get that typical, full bodied, sweetness that one can get with some Oktoberfest's, more a medium bodied, bitter, dark beer. Slightly out of style I thought. I miss the maltier, chewier body that ought to accompany the style.



Smell brings out the grain and is not that attractive.



Drinkable, but fairly simple beer, slightly above average in my book."

Doesn't drink anywhere near as massive as it looks, in fact it's a pretty light drinking brew.



Malts don't come through as I expected, but there is a balance to the beer, if somewhat unspectacular. Not much nose, but a decent mouthfeel.



Nice level of carbonation gives this a lively look and a pretty refreshig effect on the palate.

Largely devoid of any aroma, significant taste or body, I suppose the brewer has succeeded in their goals.



Completely transparent, on the verge of colorless, certainly tasteless since the ""beer"" has been taken out of this brew.



Lawnmower potential fairly high, but lacks lacohol as well as taste so perhaps not.

A little acidic in the nose and the initial tastes. Some fruity, hop bitterness is apparent too. The beer is what I would describe as ""mildly hoppy and light"".



Relatively low ABV makes this drinkable, and classically ""English Bitter"" in style. The lightness, the drinkability and the general feel of the beer had some definite cask characteristics.



Only one let down, a ridiculous price paid in a bar ($8.25)!"
Highland Brewing,Highland Oatmeal Porter,,,American Porter,5.80%,on-tap,2.85,3,2.5,3,2.5,3,6/23/2005,"Disappointed. The body had a lot of red highlights and was quite transparent around the edges - I like to see a fuller body. It was poured for me with virtually no head, so subsequently there was no lacing, but I am sure this beer, if poured correctly, can look much better than it did on this ocassion.



Distinct lack of aroma, again probably due to the ridiculously cold serving temperature. Quite a thin mouthfeel, without any coating on the tongue or teeth.



The taste? Well it went from a bitterish, hoppy beginning to what I found to be an ultra sweet ending. The sweetness seemed artificial too, almost to the point of a clawing nastiness.



I would give this another try, perhaps from the bottle, and perhaps in another bar where they can present it better, but for now this was a let down."

Defiite aroma's of toast, but malt sweetness is there too. Not many hops until the finish and then they come through with a satisfying dry edge.



Reminded me a little of a Barley Wine, with some warmth in terms of alcohol and the appearance was really very BW like."
Carolina Beer Company,Cottonwood Frostbite,,,Winter Warmer,8.50%,bottle,3.9,4,4,4,4,3.5,6/19/2005,"Definite, dark coffee undertones make this beer a real winter warmer. Quite heavy in terms of hops and bitterness, most certainly not a light beer in any way shape or form.



Really dense, black body and a lively tan head make it look like it tastes. Aromas are a little smoky. Good coating in the mouth, this is a full bodied beer.



Lots of bitter coffee present and not much else. Whatever alcohol is in there is masked and the malt body is not present to any degree. Definitely best consumed on dark nights in cold weather."

All I know is this a very hoppy beer to be considered still in the Pilsner category. Oh well, I guess it doesn't really matter.



Golden pour with a slightly disappointing lack of head, but some lacing. Very little aroma, but this may be my inability to pick it up. Tastes are definite hop-based bitterness with a distinct lack of malt backbone. This has alcohol up front and all the way through and finishes as bitter as it started.



A nice, beer with strength of purpose and character, this really drinks like a strong lager. Not bad, but yopu have to be in the mood for it."
Butte Creek Brewing Company,Mt. Shasta Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),4.70%,bottle,3.08,2.5,3.5,3,3,3,6/18/2005,"Golden, almost yellow color, this looks much more like a macro swill lager than I was expecting for the style. Lack of orange highlights is a little concerning for a PA or IPA.



Strange head situation too! Very little head to speak of, but some good lacing. Odd combination.



The beer promises much in the initial tastes and aromas, with plenty of bitter hops coming through in first few sips, but then it seems to fade very, very fast. The taste seems to evaporate in the mouth immediately to leave a very bland and uninspiring drink. No character is left behind.



Mouthfeel was a little thin too. Rather disappointing, could and should be, much better."

Nice looking, deep orange pour with significant head and lacing. A lot of chill haze.



Hoppy bitterness is upfront in the nose and the taste and lingers sufficiently to give satisfaction. Bitterness is complimented well with the sweetness of the malt, and makes for a well rounded, great stand-by beer. The kind of thing you could quite happily have lots of in the fridge.



Very drinkable and solid example of the style."
Fuller Smith & Turner PLC,Fuller's India Pale Ale,,,English India Pale Ale (IPA),4.90%,bottle,4.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,6/18/2005,"Much more of a classic, English IPA than the hoppier, stronger American versions, this is yet another example of a finely crafted brew that, if it is to be appreciated fully, one needs to understand the style and understand the art of subtle beer brewing.



The flavors here are much sweeter and maltier than many American drinkers expect from an IPA, and as a result, many Stateside will probably not enjoy as much as others.



Lovely balanced nose and hops, with a certain earthy, organic quality. I often get grassy notes in Fuller's beers, what I like to call a certain honesty about them.



Copper color with a generous, lasting head this beer looks the part. Hops are muted, but ever present, slightly biting at the finish but fading slowly and gracefully.



A hearty beer that is simply delicious."

12 oz bottle from PittBeerGirl as part of 2010 Secret Bunny. Much the same to report in terms of taste, BUT the beer seems a LOT lighter (yellow) color than I recall (and that my notes would suggest) from five years ago. Inter"
Brouwerij Verhaeghe,Duchesse De Bourgogne,,,Flanders Red Ale,6.20%,bottle,4.15,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,6/16/2005,"This was pretty much exactly what I thought it would be.
If you were brought up like I was, in an area of England renowned for its cider production, then this will remind you very much of a dry, genuine ""scrumpy"" farmhouse cider. The only difference being the dark mahogany colored body, and the slightly less crisp feel that you would associate with those rural ciders. 
Small head that quickly disappears, this beer is not really something you are going to drink much of, more a mood beer, or perhaps something good for a thirst quenching moment. Color and deep body are attractive, with a sour twang and associated apple aromas. Light vinegar and sweet and sour notes blend perfectly to produce a delicate and striking beer. 
Mouthfeel is fruit like, but lacks the crispness of a cider.
Definitely an odd ball from the usual range of tastes and beer experiences, but much, much easier to drink than the related(?), pure Lambic style. Worth a try, but certainly won't be to everyone's taste."
"Inveralmond Brewery Ltd., The",Blackfriar,,,Scottish Ale,7.00%,bottle,2.98,4,4,2.5,3.5,2.5,6/16/2005,"Very nice looker, with a deep, dense reddish brown body, good fluffy head and some sticky lacing.



Aroma and initial taste promise much malt, and you do get some, but not to the extent that I was expecting. Then another surprise - a really hoppy, fairly short, but very, very bitter kick in the finish. I didn't really enjoy that little unexpected moment, and I thought that it served to cause the beer to be slightly unbalanced.



Mouthfeel is good, with a little slick, oily feeling, but that unusual bitter suddeness dealt this brew a fatal blow with me."
Flying Fish Brewing Company,ESB Amber Ale,,,American Amber / Red Ale,5.50%,bottle,3.58,4,3,3.5,4,4,6/15/2005,"Decent. ESB this isn't, but it's a nice drink.
Dark orange pour with good head and good lacing provides a nice appearance in the glass.
Aroma and tastes are not huge, but the main characteristic is the very mild grapefruit hop finish. Despite the lack of large flavors and distinct tastes, there is a balance and a satisfying mouthfeel that belies the simple nature of this beer.
Very drinkable, definitely a session candidate."
Wychwood Brewery Company Ltd,Goliath,,,English Pale Ale,4.70%,bottle,4.08,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,6/15/2005,"Love the presentation, this looks like it is going to be a monster of a beer, but pans out to be something quite different.



Pours the color of tea with a tiny bit of mild added, a sort of cloudy, copper/orange color. There was a heck of a lot of yeast sediment in the bottle that gave the beer a certain opaque quality, but when it poured it seemd clearer in the glass than in the bottle.



Definite, mild yeast aroma and taste. A little biscuit in there and a very slight, hop, dry finish.



If you like massive beers you won't care for this much, if you like subtley crafted, drinkable beers you probably will.



Excellent potential for sessions, as the ABV and the tastes are both muted and mild. Nice, I'll be back again."
Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,Sierra Nevada Summerfest Lager,,,Czech Pilsener,5.00%,bottle,1.53,2,2,1.5,1.5,1,6/14/2005,"Awful. A nasty macro in micro packaging.



Reminded me of a low quality macro lager, with all the charm and sophistication that goes with them. Nasty color, nasty aroma and a weak, but somehow unpleasant taste. Bright gold, incredibly clear (frankly this literally looks like piss) with zero head retention and a nasty adjunct taste.



Drink BMC they're cheaper."
Unibroue,Don de Dieu,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,9.00%,bottle,4.33,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,6/14/2005,"Golden, crystal clear pour with a decent frothy head and some sticky lacing.



The aroma is ALL fruits. Gentle, ripe soft fruits not the dark, deep darker fruits, just very pleasant.



Crisp alcohol meets the palate first but smooths out to an incredibly drinkable, very smooth beer. Well rounded with alcohol character a main player in the mouth.



Lots of danger here when mixing the drinkability with the alcohol.



Finish is crisp and smooth and reflects a very, very nice beer."

2009 vintage.
The beer exudes a reddish brown hue with the classic, spotty, cream lace that sits atop the body. Appearance bumped by 0.5 from the original review.
Alcohol remains a feature here, but the beer gives up more marz"
Atlantic Brewing Company,Coal Porter,,,American Porter,6.50%,bottle,3.58,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,6/11/2005,"Standard jet black, opaque appearance with a fairly small tan head that falls away quickly to give a very small film for the remainder of the drink. No significant lacing.



Definite bitterness in the finish and a distinct smoky taste. Good mouthfeel, but not really a ""coater"". Quite light and relatively refreshing. Generally I like a little more creaminess and less smokiness in my porters, but nonetheless a drinkable beer."
Brouwerij Alken-Maes,Grimbergen Dubbel,,,Dubbel,6.50%,bottle,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,6/11/2005,"One of the most delicious Dubbels that I have tasted in some time. Not normally one of my favorite styles, I sometimes find them lacking in depth and character, but not here.



Almost reminded me of a Dopplebock, wuth loads of mixed fruits soaked in alcohol. Fantastic looking, dark brown pour with a lovely, large head that lasts wonderfullly with stacks of sticky lacing.



Very smooth and full in the mouth making this a silky experience that goes down beautifully for a great drinkability experience too."
Guinness Ltd.,Guinness Extra Stout (Original),,,Irish Dry Stout,6.00%,bottle,4.13,4.5,4,4,5,4,6/11/2005,"I suppose much of this is redundant as it's been said hundreds (299 to be exact) of times before, but here goes anyway.



The classic jet black pour with a suprisingly rocky tan head. Lots of air in the head, making it frothy and not at all dense. Some very substantial and sticky lacing too.



Much sweeter than I remember before bothering to take notes and review, with a lack of bitterness and lack of alcohol edge until the very, very end. Smooth (not nitro smooth obviously) but nevertheless very easy drinking.



Mouthfeel hits the exact right tone with me, with creaminess, edge and bitterness all coming together to give a magnificently rounded experience.



Still a classic standard. This ain't the nitro pint."
Old Dominion Brewing Co.,Dominion Millennium Ale,,,English Barleywine,11.40%,bottle,2.28,2,2,2.5,2.5,2,6/11/2005,"Barleywines walk a fine line with me. The combination of the sticky sweetness and the alcohol really needs to strike the right balance to pull it off, and it's very easy for a BW to fall out of favor with me if one of the two dominates too much. I think they are a difficult style to make work well.



Disappointing looking beer with a dank, light brown appearance that looks murky and fairly unattractive. No head to speak of.



Far too sweet for me. Viscous sugar is just about all I get with a very hot finish of burning alcohol at the end. A real struggle to get through this, didn't enjoy it much at all."
Pivovariya Ivana Taranova,Doctor Diesel,,,Euro Pale Lager,6.90%,bottle,2.9,3,3,3,3,2.5,6/11/2005,"Extremely average, light colored lager with little to commend it from any point of view.



Malts and grains in the nose serve to confirm what one would expect from the pale, piss colored pour with no head.



Slightly higher ABV than normal gives a little kick in the finish, but that's where the interest ends.



Don't bother with this, there's really no point."
Pete's Brewing Company,Pete's Wicked Rally Cap Ale,,,American Blonde Ale,5.00%,bottle,3.25,3.5,3,3.5,3,3,6/8/2005,"Slightly above average, light colored, easy drinking beer with a refreshing thirst quenching effect but little else to write home about.



Standard macro lager looking pour but with a better head than usual, but unfortunately this disappears quickly. Moderate to light body with a little citrus in there. Mouthfeel is simply ordinary, in fact the whole beer is rather average - I could be drinking almost any of 1000 beers!"
Atlantic Brewing Company,Mount Desert Island Ginger,,,Herbed / Spiced Beer,5.20%,bottle,2.63,3,3.5,2.5,2.5,2,6/7/2005,"Generally I like to be encouraging of brewers that try different things, as from time to time they can produce some really nice ""off the wall"" experiements. I don't think that this was one of those winners.



Plenty of ginger in the nose and a little in the taste, the beer only really succeeded in being slightly sour and rather acidic.



An orange pour with no head to speak of, its appeal was lost fairly quickly as the acidity overpowered the ginger, and the beer was lost.



Nice try, but best to leave it and move on. Don't bother with this itsa gallane failure."

A lot more drinkable on draught - $4.25 for the 16oz pour at Taco Mac, Douglasville, GA, USA.
Thin, pale color with some lace, but the head is very wispy and has no depth.
Simple, light caramel sweetness and refreshing. Not much to report here, but significantly better on tap han in the bottle for me.
Original Review 06/05

I didn't care for this much.
Elaborate description of the beer on the rear label - I like that, but it compared itself to Bass that I think is a stretch.
Hazy orange with a large head following an aggresive pour, but the head fades fast to leave a somewhat flat looking beer.
Aroma - I didn't get much, it may be that I was drinking it too cold, but even on warming that didn't change much.
Taste - very bitter. Not in a good way either. It wasn't a hop bitterness, rather a slightly sour, acidic taste.
Body was thin and weak that led to a thin mouthfeel. I won't be in a hurry to go back to this."
Old Dominion Brewing Co.,New River Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),5.50%,bottle,3.98,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,6/6/2005,"Very nice pour with a crystal clear, golden appearance and an impressively large, billowing white head.



Aroma is immensely hoppy, but the beer drinks much less hopped than the smell would suggest.



Clean on the palate, with some citrus notes, but not overwhelming. The aroma says IPA, the taste just Pale Ale. Very clean and refreshing, a very good intro/cross over beer with potential to be a great stand-by for the fridge."
Orkney Brewery,SkullSplitter,,,Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy,8.50%,bottle,4.38,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,6/6/2005,"Huge malts and lots of alcohol are the overwhelming experience of this beer.
Great looking dark amber pour with a substantial head. The large frothy head does disappear quickly, but still leaves some nice spotty creaminess and some significant lacing.
Definite aroma and taste of Port and Plums, with plenty of other dark alocoholic fruit in there too.
A sharp, dry alcohol finish that doesn't linger but reminds you of the ABV.
A lovely sipper, take care with this brew and enjoy in moderation. Respect!"
Brouwerij Bavik,Wittekerke,,,Witbier,5.00%,bottle,3.58,4,3,3.5,4,4,6/5/2005,"Not bad.



Pretty standard appearance for a decent Wit, with the anticipated lemon, cloudy hue and a large billowing, white head. Looks good, although the lacing and the head retention are not up to much.



I didn't get the large citrus nose that some others have noted, in fact, the whole aroma and taste experience was rather subdued. Not the most potent Wit in a style that is seldom very gregarious. Good mouthfeel, and drinkability.



Decent player in a pinch, but there are lots of better examples. Seek them before Wittekerke, but be happy to have this ahead of some others."
Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Watou Tripel,,,Tripel,7.50%,bottle,2.55,2,3.5,2,2.5,3,6/5/2005,"Not bad, but way too sweet for a Tripel in my opinion. This is coming from a man who generally likes malty, sweet beers, but this seemed to abandon the style slightly.



Golden hue, but huge amounts of nasty looking yeasty sediment still entered the glass despite the careful pour. Not good looking stuff either, it sort of half floated, half sank, quite unappetizing. A bit thin, a bit too orange orverall. Head was not thick enough, and was lost way too soon and was really quite poor. No billowing creamy dense white head that I have come to expect from this style.



Sweetness (not in a good way) dominated the beer. Alcohol and dry ending that should have been present were just not there in sufficient or lingering enough quantities. No spice at all detected.



Thin, sugary mouthfeel, not good.



Poor Tripel in my opinion, very surprising for this consistently good brewery. However, good enough to be decently drinkable."
Brouwerij Van den Bossche,Pater Lieven Tripel,,,Tripel,8.00%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,6/5/2005,"Quite impressed. 750 mL bottle, corked and capped.



Good value Tripel with all the classic attributes in place and solid.



Lovely pour into my Chimay chalice with a generous head, excellent lacing and some super orange/gold color.



Lots of spice and pepper in the taste, with a good alcoholic content and definite dry finish too. Alcohol is well disguised and not overpowering. Mouthfeel is satisfying, with some tart, citrus notes amongst the spices. Very rounded and more complex that I was expecting - really rather nice.



All in all a very good representation of the style."
Caledonian Brewery,Golden Promise Organic Ale,,,English Pale Ale,5.00%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,6/3/2005,"Pretty unusual find this one, I got it in TN and I'd never seen it in GA before. Bar staff were also confused by it so I'm guessing this was a recent addition to the line-up. Elaborate label, different to the one in the database picture and lots of crappy , advertising guf about its organic greatness!?



Pours a very attractive golden color - so far so good in relation to the name - but gave a pretty small head that I only managaed to invigorate by constantly topping up from the bottle into my pint glass.



Some grass in the aroma (was that my imagination thinking Organic?) and a nice creamy mouthfeel.



As others have noted, a nice balance of malt and hops, and struck the happy medium between being not too bland, but at the same time not too challenging either.



Easy drinking, but one was enough before I wanted to move on. Summer time drinking might be in order."
Whitbread PLC,Whitbread Pale Ale,,,English Pale Ale,5.70%,bottle,3.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,6/3/2005,"I note this appears to be contract brewed in the USA and it is certainly significantly different to how I remember drinking it maybe 10 years ago at home (England). Perhaps that's as a result of the stateside brewing, or maybe just changes in the beer over time, but in any case this beer has changed since I last drank it.



Very nice looking pour, with a distinctly amber body and a full, lingering head with some nice lacing. This is a good looking beer.



Very much more malty than I remember it. In fact it was more ""Bock"" like than anything else. Very surprising. Decent dry hop finish too, this is still a good beer despite changes for the worse over the course of the last ten years.



Nice full mouthfeel as well, very drinkable."
Big River Grille & Brewing Works,Summer Wheat 2005,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,?,on-tap,3.3,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,6/2/2005,"Bar staff told me that this had been tapped for about a month at BRG.



Good, yellow color to the body and a decent head, but it lasted all too short a time. Some nice lacing, and came in a ""Summer Wheat 2005"" 400 mL glass. For some reason I like this serving size. Nice presentation.



Quite a surprising ""hoppy"" aroma, but light body as expected. The carbonation seemed to die a little as I drank the beer and as it warmed. Some fruit, but all the tastes were rather muted.



Drinkable without doubt, but left me a little unsatisfied. Lacked character even if it were harmless enough."
Hacker-Pschorr Bräu GmbH,Hacker-Pschorr Dunkle Weisse,,,Dunkelweizen,5.30%,bottle,3.58,2.5,3.5,4,3.5,3,6/2/2005,"Disclaimer: I must admit that this style is not one of my favorites.
The most disappointing thing about Dunkel Weizens in general to me, is their appearance. I find the brown cloudiness very unappealing, and I think that this puts me off many, otherwise good beers. This was no exception with the appearance reminding me of old washing-up water - not at all attractive. Very poor head as well, which I think was due to the hopeless pour and general non-attention given to presenting the beer at the bar I was drinking at. However having poured this for myself at home subsequently, I aslo found the head fading very quickly to almost nothing, and there is certainly no lacing apparent.
Outside of the appearance, the standard malty banana and clove overtones with lots of background sweetness and a drier than expected yeast finish. Quite a surprising amount of alcohol present as well.
Slight alcohol warmth (again, a little odd) and a slight citrus finish.
Pretty good for the style, but my hang-ups about these beers in general are still bugging me."
Red Brick Brewing Company,Kelly's Light Irish Stone Brewed,,,Light Lager,?,bottle,3.88,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,6/1/2005,"Not at all bad.



Never going to be my favorite style, but this hits the spot on a hot Atlanta Spring day.



Good looker, with a clear pale straw color, excellent head and some lacing.



Good bitterness all the way through and a definite thirst quenching effect. No skunk and decent level of carbonation and crispness. Reminded me a lot of a Kolsch.



This is not a great beer, but I was happily surprised by its general drinkability and quality. I wasn't expecting much, but got a little more than I bargained for."
San Miguel Corporation,San Miguel Premium Lager,,,American Adjunct Lager,5.00%,bottle,3.08,3.5,2.5,3,3.5,3.5,5/31/2005,"Surprisingly drinkable.



I was expecting the usual adjunct macro swill, but got a half-decent, creamy sweet lager that looked attractive and drank easy.



Some hint of grain in the nose, but not too much and it passed the skunk test! Some creaminess in the mouth and quite refreshing without ever breaking into tastiness!



Don't get me wrong, this is like lots of other thirst quenchers out there, and is no more than a decent lawnmower style, but I wouldn't turn it down.



Lack of bitterness in the finish relegates it to an also ran, but at least it not nasty like so many of this style can be. Not good, but not bad either."
Union De Cervecerias Peruanas Backus y Johnston,Cristal,,,American Adjunct Lager,5.00%,bottle,2.5,2.5,2,2.5,2.5,3,5/31/2005,"Very light and predictabley disappointing. Pale straw pour with a wispy, thin head that didn't hang around for long.



Corny and grainy with little or no malt detectable, but some bitterness in the finish. Pretty clean - that's on the upside, but utterly non-descript outside of that.



Definitely does a good job with some spicy food, or as a lawnmower, but outside of that this offers absolutley nothing that other, probably cheaper macro swill can't do. Don't go an inch out of your way to try this!"
Birra Peroni Industriale S.p.A.,Peroni Nastro Azzurro,,,Euro Pale Lager,5.10%,bottle,2.93,3.5,3,3,3,2.5,5/30/2005,"Very, very little to report here.
Simple, and very pale lager color with a surprisingly good, billowing head that was pleasing. Decent crispness and refreshing character. No skunk - absolutely vital in these beers - a decent warm weather thirst quencher.
Very little aroma to speak of except a little corn, and the tastes are muted with some fresh hay but not a lot else. No bitterness, really rather sweet.
Unoffensive but literally 1000's of others out there will do the same job."
Orkney Brewery,Dragonhead Stout,,,English Stout,4.00%,bottle,2.68,4,4,2.5,1.5,2,5/30/2005,"Quite disappointing.



Good looker, with a jet black body and nicely formed, frothy head and some lacing. Good nose, with some burnt chocolate overtones. All very promising, but the taste and mouthfeel (especially the mouthfeel) were big letdowns.



Much too thin and lacklustre for a stout, and the combination of the lack of body and some nasty prickly carbonation really made a mess of this brew.



The carbonation was particularly annoying giving the beer the feel of a fizzy lager rather than a smooth stout. Regardless of the type of stout I'm drinking, I'm looking for that ""nitro"" smooth feel - this gave exactly the opposite with noisy, bubbles of gas in every mouthful. Not to my liking at all."
Harvey & Son Ltd.,Harveys Elizabethan Ale,,,Old Ale,8.10%,bottle,4.6,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5/29/2005,"1998 Vintage.



Smell is truly magnificent. Mainly deep, fruity alcohol that is reminiscent of port or sherry. Pour is deep brown, but with some very substantial red highlights. I'd like to see a bigger head on the beer, but the style, the age and the alcohol simply aren't going to produce it so we'll have to live with it.



Excellent dry alcoholic finish follows the fruit and fig start. A delicious sipper.



A first class Old Ale, rapidly becoming one of my favorite styles."
Five Seasons Prado,Phoenix Pils,,,German Pilsener,?,on-tap,4.13,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,5/26/2005,"Very refreshing and satisfying.



Classic appearance with, what I consider to be the most important part of the look for a pilsner, a head with excellent retention. Even with quality pils, if you lose the head you'll end up with something that looks like an adjunct macro lager.



Definite sweetness in the aroma, but a sufficient hop bite to make the beer feel real. I enjoyed the cleanliness of the brew and it's refreshing quality. Great summertime-lunchtime drinking."
Brouwerij Bavik,Petrus Gouden Tripel,,,Tripel,7.50%,bottle,3.65,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,5/25/2005,"Striking color, absolutely golden with a decent head and some lacing.



Quite dry, with a little prickly carbonation in the mouthfeel. Definite spicy character with some fruit, but it was difficult to pin down the exact fruits and spices that were in play.



Dry in the finish and somewhat uninspiring for a Tripel. Worth a try if you like a more subdued Belgian but a little disappointing if you're looking for a bigger beer."

Paid $13.49 for a four pack at Smyrna World of Beverage - this is getting pricey. Great clarity as usual and the classic, sweet alcoholic experience. Not to be trifled with!

Had to come back with some additional notes on this great beer now it has reached GA. It remains VERY sweet and that's really why I love it. Drinks well below 10% ABV, but at the same time you're unlikely to be drinking more than one or two in a session. Deliciously smooth with a little alcohol kick in the finish.

Pours a pale golden with a small, frothy bone-white head and some significant lacing.
I was very surpised at the upfront, malty sweetness of this. I was expecting a more in your face hop-bomb, but was delighted with the deliciously different beer that was in front of me.
Very creamy texture due to the carbonation and the sweetness, the hops really didn't kick in right until the very end of the finish. Some dryness and a little bitter hop kick in the dregs of each mouthful, but all in all the hops are very surprisingly subdued. I liked that, I wonder if others will be disappointed that a DIPA is not more upfront with the ""in the face"" hops?
All in all a very nice experience, I enjoyed slowly sipping this one as it gently warmed."
Traquair House Brewery Lld,Traquair House Ale,,,Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy,7.20%,bottle,4,4,4.5,4,3,4,5/22/2005,"Nice looking pour with distinct red highlights amongst the dark amber body. A thin head that quickly disappears with some small amount of lacing.



Lots of malt sweetness and sugary caramel in the nose.



Quite heavy on the alcohol upfront, but this fades quickly to give a warmth through the rest of the drink.



Mouthfeel is not as good as one would be led to believe by the nose, in fact quite thin in comparison to what I was expecting.



Definite molasses and malt body, which I like, but the mouthfeel was a little too thin for my liking."
Brouwerij Sterkens N.V.,St. Sebastiaan Dark,,,Dubbel,6.90%,bottle,3,3,4,3,2,2.5,5/21/2005,"Somewhat disappointed by this. Novelty of the ""ceramic"" appearance ""bottle"" is lost quickly, although I do like the flip top potential of keeping the beer in the fridge for a couple of hours after it has been opened.



Very malty, sweet nose, almost reminiscent of a pretty good doppelbock. However that's where the good stuff ended.



Drab, brown pour with a large amount of (presumabley) yeast floaties. Alcoholic warmth seems very high for such a relatively low ABV. Taste has the malts with little hop character, but they are not the warm toasted malts that the nose suggests, rather a sugary sweet then sucrose solution.



Biggest disappointment was the mouthfeel. Very, very thin and watery.



Overall a big disappointment. Not my favorite style either and tried to take that into account, but nonetheless not one I'll be back to anytime soon."
Victory Brewing Company,Storm King Stout,,,Russian Imperial Stout,9.10%,bottle,3.9,4,4,4,4,3.5,5/19/2005,"Jet black (some very small ruby red highlights) with very little head at all. A little lacing, this is a bit short on looks apart from the deeply opaque body.



Slight smokiness, with alcohol and small chocolate overtones make up the nose.



Mouthfeel is good, as expected for a high alcohol stout.



Tastes are espresso based with alcoholic warmth and some smoke to the fore. Some sweetness, but its not cloying or sickly like some beers of the style with high ABV. More bitter hops in the finish than some others in the style, and overall there is a lack of the silky smoothness that I have come to expect from the style. A little rougher around the edges than some others, a bit of a more grown-up drink than others of the same style."
Coniston Brewing Co. Ltd,Bluebird Bitter,,,English Bitter,4.20%,bottle,3.63,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,5/18/2005,"Much lighter pour than I was expecting, with a briefly frothy head and a pale, orange body. Not much lacing.



Definite strong hop aroma and very distinct lack of malt in the nose.



The malt backbone is all but missing in this beer as far as I can tell, with a lack of sweetness being apparent. Interesting, because it's not really a very hoppy experience either. An oily, but mild hop presence characterizes the beer. Very drinkable. A bit like a watered down ""American over-hopped"" IPA. Quite difficult to really describe and categorize for me."
O'Hanlon's Brewing Co. Ltd.,Royal Oak Pale Ale,,,English Pale Ale,5.00%,bottle,4.03,4.5,4,4,4,4,5/18/2005,"Dark, reddish body with a substantial off-white foamy head. Some swirling yeast in the body that settles quickly to give a great looking brew that tempts the senses. Definitely has a warm feel about it, both in the appearance and the aroma. A distinct toasty smell with some hops.



Very full in the mouth with the malts coming through strong to give balance. I was surprised at how dry the finish was. Much more so than I remember from drinking this in the past. A new recipe or some other departure from OHanlons?



Very drinkable still, but this is really a beer that is perfectly matched for cask consumption. Obviously thats not going to be happening anytime soon here in GA, USA so in the meantime this will serve as a very nice alternative."
Founders Brewing Company,Founders Breakfast Stout,,,American Double / Imperial Stout,8.30%,bottle,4.85,5,5,5,4.5,4.5,5/17/2005,"This is an absolutely exceptional beer.



Utterly opaque, jet black with the smallest of dark, burnt golden heads, it looks dangerous in the glass!



Aromas are amazingly chocolately with a very pronounced alcohol presence.



Doubtless you will have come across lots of other stouts that you thought were ""chocolately"" or ""coffee-like"", but I challenge you to find anything that is close to this on either front. Astonishing!



Without doubt it is THE most authentic chocolate and coffee tasting beer that I have ever encountered. Top it of with a fantastic alcohol presence and a lightness that belies the whole package and you've got something VERY special!



Close to perfection."
Brasserie Cantillon,Cantillon Kriek 100% Lambic,,,Lambic - Fruit,5.00%,bottle,1.7,2.5,2.5,1.5,2,1,5/15/2005,"Despite the fact that I've drunk several Saison's and I know that Lindemans Lambics are very, very sweet and not necessarily representative, I still simply wasn't ready for the jolt to the tastebuds that this beer provides.



Very low carbonation and a crimson, hazy body with no head or lacing. Lots of floating sediment appeared to be in place too. A very organic smell, a bit like horse manure! Not very thrilling to the nose.



I'm afraid that the acidic sourness of this completely overwhelmed absolutely everything else for me. In fact it was the first drain pour that I ever remember having. I just couldn't take the extreme sourness. It gave me absolutely no pleasure and masked everything else that the beer was trying to do. Literally undrinkable! For me that's saying a lot.



Obviously I've got a long way to go with the genuine Lambics, but this was a very poor start. A $6-7 a 12oz bottle, it'll be a long time before I investigate again."

Despite the large, frothy head, very little lacing to speak of.



Aroma and initial tastes are of mildly alcoholic cloves.



Quite thin in the mouth, very mild all around with a low bitterness. Some grassy, organic feel to the brew too. 



Drinks easy, a classic summer thirst quencher."
Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,St. Bernardus Pater 6,,,Dubbel,6.70%,bottle,3.53,3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,5/13/2005,"Well, given the very high standards set by the brewery, this is not their best beer, but nevertheless a solid effort.



Has that somewhat unattractive, drab brown appearance that I find a little disappointing. Some samll head and a little lacing, but neither of any great substance.



Overall the experience I got was of one of muted fruitiness, and a very upfront dry character. Neither of which were offensive, but both of which I felt were a slight let-down.



Mouthfeel was probably the best part, with a satisfying denseness to the brew. Outside of that, better than average, but a weaker brew for this outstanding brewery."
SweetWater Brewing Company,Sweetwater Hummer,,,Witbier,5.10%,on-tap,3.95,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,5/13/2005,"Firstly much of what can be said about the draft serving has been said here;



http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/273/23458/?ba=Ding



But the distinct differences are;



Not such an impressive head on draft. The serving temperature seems to dampen the carbonation. Also, in terms of the color, on draft it appears to take on the look of the Sweetwater Blue, with that very noticeable, light green tinge to the yellow body - very unusual. Still massively drinkable though. This should be HUGE in Atlanta through the hot summer of 2005."
SweetWater Brewing Company,Sweetwater Hummer,,,Witbier,5.10%,bottle,4.13,4.5,3.5,4,4,5,5/13/2005,"Very, very nice, 100% drinkable and a perfect compliment to the Atlanta heat that is slowly, but steadily, rising here in mid-May. From the bottle a large frothy, rocky head adorns the orange haze below it. Definite relationship between the orange looking body, the taste and the label, all of which pull together a distinct citrus feel and an amazingly refreshing drink. large amount of unfiltered sediment, but not dark. Odd, but this is a beer that I am going to drink exclusively in the daylight! Sounds odd I know, but this is a definite backyard, deck and grilling classic already.  Like others have said, the spiced coriander is muted, and the citrus tones are what one remembers. Lovely carbonated mouthfeel that benefits from a level of chilling that I don't generally approve of. A summer classic in the making."
Wychwood Brewery Company Ltd,Fiddler's Elbow,,,English Pale Ale,5.20%,bottle,3.93,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,5/11/2005,"First thing to note here is that this came in the brown glass bottle so it looks as though Wychwood have finally given in. Looks like the label has been slightly re-designed too to give it a fresh look.
Lovely, clear pale golden pour, but a slightly disappointing lack of head and lacing. Bags of fruity malt aroma and a solid hop backbone give this beer a nice balance. Some acidity too.
Mouthfeel above average, but not in any way substantial. Refreshing with a dryish hop finish that shows character.
If you've been avoiding Wychwood because of concerns over clear bottles, now might be a good time to re-visit them. I did and I enjoyed it."
Brouwerij Lindemans,Lindemans Framboise,,,Lambic - Fruit,2.50%,bottle,3.48,3,3.5,3.5,2.5,4,5/8/2005,"Bright red pour with the classic, frothy, large pink head. Fairly serious pink lacing!
Intense syrupy raspberry taste and equally strong aroma of sugary fruit. Definitely ""one for the ladies"", and despite its qualifications I can barely ever think of this as beer. Don't get me wrong, I like to drink it occasionally (very occasionally), but it remains a novelty drink for me, and not one I can take that seriously.
Great conversation starter, but really only good for light drinking summer days outside.
A little thick in the mouth, but very drinkable - at least until you get sick of the taste! Raspberry flavor is VERY strong, and that masks just about everything else. However, I do get a little floral note in the background too."
Wells & Young's Ltd,Young's Double Chocolate Stout,,,Milk / Sweet Stout,5.20%,bottle,4.18,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,5/8/2005,"Out of the bottle but still a nitro poured appearance. Small, perfectly formed light tan colored head sits atop the jet black body. It promises much.



Definite sugar, confectionery type aroma, but not as chocolate laden as the name or the anecdotal evidence would suggest. Certainly some cocoa type undertones, but surprisingly controlled.



I get some acidity that I wasn't expecting and little more bitterness than others in the Milk/Sweet style. I guess that's the chocolate coming through with a little bite. Layered malts complete the experience.



Mouthfeel is predictablely excellent, with a good, smooth coating all over the place. Very drinkable too."
Brouwerij Bavik,Petrus Oud Bruin,,,Flanders Oud Bruin,5.50%,bottle,3.95,4,4,4,3.5,4,5/6/2005,"Orange/brown pour with some good carbonation. Lacing is slight but present.



Very distinct and definite apple/cider sourness, reminiscent of the Lambic or Saison styles. This was somewhat surprising to me, because I'm not familiar with the Flanders Oud Bruin style.



Slight smokiness in the initial taste and very light in the mouth. I would imagine that the lightness might sit uncomfortabley with some, especially those people who were expecting a more robust brown ale type beer.



Drinkable and refreshing.



Really quite unusual and well worth a try."
Pivzavod Baltika / Baltic Beverages Holding,Baltika #3 Classic,,,Euro Pale Lager,4.80%,bottle,2.95,3,3,3,2.5,3,4/30/2005,"Sweet (over and) undertones to this malt-based lager, with only very little dry hoppy bitterness.



Not a very special beer to look at, thin, pale and yellow with no significant head beyond the first few seconds of the aggressive pour.



Just about fufills my (low expectation) criteria for these beers, i.e. no skunk, drinkable, refreshing and no unpleasant aftertaste. Outside of that nothing to report.



Baltika makes several other, better beers. Don't be put off by this pretty average showing."
Brooklyn Brewery,Brooklyn Ale / Pennant Ale '55,,,English Pale Ale,5.00%,bottle,3,3,3,3,3,3,4/24/2005,"Amber red pour with little or no head to speak of. No lacing. Mainly malt in the nose and the body, with a little hop bitterness coming through. Balanced, but very uninspiring.



Quite plain. Insufficient carbonation for me, making the whole experience a little flat. Mouthfeel rather too thin for much more than average ratings.



Nice jazzy striped bottle (different to the one pictured).



Not one of BB best efforts."
"Middle Ages Brewing Co., Ltd.",Wailing Wench,,,American Strong Ale,8.00%,bottle,3.9,4,4,4,4,3.5,4/24/2005,"Dark mahogany pour, with a splendid looking rocky head. Some sticky lace.
This is a rich, thick and substantial beer that reminded me much more of a Barleywine than the DIPA.
Loads of rich hops greet the nose, with that classic grapefruit, citrus sourness, but also with oodles of complex malts. This drank really heavily and it punched every bit of its 9.00 ABV.
Mouthfeel was oily and syrupy like a Barleywine. I think I may have been deceived by the beer since I drank a really light, but hoppy IPA just prior to this. The first one was light and refreshing, this one came down as being really robust and quite harsh in (perhaps unfair) comparison.
Need to try this one again in a different context and I suspect I would like it even more than I did this time."
Stone Brewing Co.,Stone Ruination IPA,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,7.70%,bottle,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4/24/2005,"Very unusually I found myself craving some hops. What better way to take care of that than with some Ruination? Thanks to Prostman.
Crystal clear, golden orange pour with a fantastic, large, billowing, rocky head and some sticky lacing. A treat to behold in the glass. Some huge hops in the nose and the initial taste, but they are simply not over-powering. In fact, the taste was sort of mild! Very surprising.
Very refeshing with a smooth ending and a classic metallic bitternes at the back of the mouth to remind you of what you're drinking. A little oily hop presence too.
Another super Stone product."
Brouwerij Bosteels,Tripel Karmeliet,,,Tripel,8.40%,bottle,4.35,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,4/23/2005,"Typical champagne style pale Belgian with the classic white, rocky head, light golden body and a high carbonation with a yeasty finish. Alcohol most definitely present, but under-developed to keep it non-pronounced and highly, highly drinkable.



Drinks lighter than your average Tripel.



Great example of the style, with fruit notes present but all combined beautifullty to give a balanced beer with all the touches of a classic. Wonderful mouth balance and a dryish but lovely finish."
Asia Pacific Breweries Ltd.,Tiger Beer,,,American Adjunct Lager,5.00%,bottle,2,2,1.5,2,2,2.5,4/22/2005,"Very, very simple, non-descript and instantly forgetable. My wife picked this up and said, ""This is the kind of beer I like, not as strong as the stuff you usually drink"". That says it all.



Simply put, another adjunct macro lager with nothing to endear it to anyone. Clean finish, but some skunk, definite over-carbonation and zero positive aromas. A little bitter hoppiness against the backdrop of some weak malt, but frankly a wash. Don't bother."
Bierbrouwerij De Koningshoeven B.V.,La Trappe Dubbel (Koningshoeven / Dominus),,,Dubbel,7.00%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,4/21/2005,"This drinks bigger than it's ABV, with a distinct alcohol presence and lots of dark fruit in the nose and in the initial tastes.



Dark brown pour with a scant head, but a substantial looking beer. I was quite surpised by the level of carbonation - really quite aggressive.



Solid malt backbone, but the finish was a little on the dry side for my liking. Good fruits all the way through with a full mouthfeel. Lots of ripe, bursting type fruits are present which adds to the palate sensation.



Solid example, nice Belgian and excellent value in the four-pack sampler with glass."
Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),Samuel Adams Scotch Ale,,,Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy,5.40%,bottle,4.35,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,4/17/2005,"Very nice.
This is a very attractive beer, with an absolutely crystal clear pour in the dark red body. Good carbonation, some creamy spotty head and some significant sticky lacing all add to the substantial and pleasing appearance. Roasted malts in the nose and some sugary sweetness as well.
As expected, a nice malt backbone with a significant bitter hop finish. Sweetness and bitterness (without drying) complement one another nicely, for excellent balance. A sort of sweet and sour combo! Pleasing body, and this translates to a full and rounded mouthfeel. More peat character than I remember in the past.
Another solid Sam Admas, and another to get the crossover crowd introduced to better things. Downside is that is seems to only available in the Brewmaster's 12 pack sampler. I'd like to get a 6 pack of this on its own."
Hilton Head Brewing Company,Scottish Heritage Ale,,,Scottish Ale,?,on-tap,4,4,4,4,4,4,4/17/2005,"This beer is apparently brewed each year, for the MCI Heritage Golf Classic PGA Tour event, that is held on Hilton Head Island in April. It is usually tapped about one week before the event, and then lasts as long as it does afterwards. I drank two pints on the Saturday afternoon of the 2005 tournament on 04/16/05.



Looks and tastes much like a good quality Porter. Black appearance with ruby highlights and a lot of sweet malt flavors all over the place. Nice tan head with sticky lacing featuring. A very nice looking pint with a certain smokiness about it.



Maintains the relative lightness of body and a very smooth finish that the best Porters should have (HHB does describe this as a Scottish Ale).



One of the better offerings at HHB, unfortunately this is likely to be pretty difficult to get hold of outside a few weeks in the Spring each year."
Tröegs Brewing Company,Troegenator Double Bock,,,Doppelbock,8.20%,bottle,4.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,4/15/2005,"Not as malty and full as I was expecting or had been led to believe. A simple Doublebock with a low profile character in many respects, and an easy drinker. This is most definitely NOT a Celebrator.



Mid-brown pour with some reddish highlights and a nice head. I drank this one quickly which says something about its smoothness and its non-overpowering malt backbone.



Hides the ABV well, another beer that you could use as a crossover. I thought this was a very mild example of the style that lacked the massive punch that some other Doppelbocks often have. In that respect it was a nice change from the aggression often found in the style. Doppelbock light??"
Bierbrouwerij De Koningshoeven B.V.,La Trappe Quadrupel (Koningshoeven / Dominus),,,Quadrupel (Quad),10.00%,bottle,4.05,4,4,4,4.5,4,4/10/2005,"Very strong, but controlled flavors make this a Quad one that is not too overpowering. Don't get me wrong, it still needs to be handled with care, but it won't knock you over as long as you are concentrating on what you're consuming.



Not as dry and warming as the ABV might sugggest, this starts off with some mild banana and spice that warms up slightly on warming(!) A lovely mid-brown pour in the Konings chalice, the head is ""noisy"" and thick.



Mouthfeel is excellent with a real rounded fruit and alcohol mix making it very satisfying. Smells are predominantly deep alcoholic bananas and some other soft, tropical fruits like pineapple."
Abita Brewing Co.,Amber,,,Vienna Lager,4.50%,bottle,2.88,3.5,2.5,3,2.5,3,4/8/2005,"Have to admit that this was generally disappointing to me. Simply very thin in the mouth with little or no character and a mild taste that simply failed to satisfy.



Poured out a light orange color with the small head fading fast to nothing. Very light feel about the whole beer, and no depth to the experience.



Drinkable, but very little character. Some dryness in the finish with a slight toffee like after taste. Very little to endear this to you. Won't bother again anytime soon."
New Belgium Brewing,Trippel Belgian Style Ale,,,Tripel,7.80%,bottle,4.3,5,4,4,4.5,5,4/8/2005,"I was absolutely amazed at the height of the % ABV for this beer, it drinks miles below that mark and for that reason alone this gives the impression of being a well crafted product.
Poured into the NBB bulb, this looks great. Small, but perfectly formed rocky, white head sits a top the dense golden body. Perfect looking! Lovely alcohol and mild fruit aromas greet the nose. Tastes are definitely yeast-body based, and the Tripel style is well represented.
Full bodied and stylish, this beer strikes an unusual balance of style, taste, substance, satisfaction and authenticity that is unusually high on all fronts.
Amazing drinkability. Really very nice. Thanks to babydoc (twice)."
Wells & Young's Ltd,Young's Waggledance Honey Ale,,,English Pale Ale,5.00%,bottle,3.95,4,4,4,3.5,4,4/8/2005,"As usual, very solid offering from Young's.



Definitely a good looking beer with plenty of the golden honey that you get in the taste reflected in the appearance. Light color and frothy head promise refreshment and that's what you get.



Certainly the honey taste does come through strong, especially in the finish. Lots of sweet notes underlie this brew which is its strength. Definite sense of lightness and freshness about it. Spring/Summer possibilities?



Aroma's are malt honey and taste reflects them.



Perhaps a little too thin and light to be taken seriously in the style, and there is a distinct lack of hop character, but a drinkable beer with plenty to make it worth trying again."
"Bell's Brewery, Inc.",Third Coast Old Ale,,,American Barleywine,10.20%,bottle,3.88,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,4/4/2005,"Typical Barleywine/Old Ale appearance, with a dense, dark brown body and virtually no head (what little that there was disapates quickly to leave a ring around the circumference). Yeast floaties hang around the whole body of the beer.



The aromas start attacking the second that the cap is prised off. The nose is all sugary caramels.



Very, very sweet and that's coming from someone who likes malty, sugary beers. A good hop finish that is a nice one for me since it mellows out and is not too strong.



Light syrupy mouthfeel is not overwhelmingly heavy like some others in the style can be.



Definite warming on the way down, but it is controlled and balanced.



Nice example, thanks to beerhandy in the Secret Bunny '05."
Bierbrouwerij De Koningshoeven B.V.,La Trappe Tripel (Koningshoeven / Dominus),,,Tripel,8.00%,bottle,3.95,4,4,4,3.5,4,4/3/2005,"Purchased this as part of the gift pack (A tripel, Dubbel, Blonde and Quad with a Koningshoeven chalice) - GREAT value at $7.99 the lot!
This Tripel is a very, very subdued example of the style. The furitiness, alcohol and aromas are all presnt, but they are mild compared with many others in the style.
Light, golden body with some lacing but not much to speak of. Alcoholic fruits dominate a mild nose, and the initial flavors I get are some pear and pineapple in a typical ester based beer.
A little astringency and above average mouthfeel
Don't get me wrong, this is a nice beer that I enjoyed driking very much, but this is definitely not a Tripel to remember. It's slightly disappointing to an experienced palate, and would probably leave a newbie thinking what's all the fuss about Belgian Tripel's?
Excellent value though, worth a try."
Bierbrouwerij De Koningshoeven B.V.,La Trappe Blond (Koningshoeven / Dominus),,,Belgian Pale Ale,6.50%,bottle,3.35,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,4/3/2005,"Purchased this as part of the gift pack (A tripel, Dubbel, Blonde and Quad with a Konings Hoeven Chalice) - GREAT value at $7.99 the lot!



Interesting - not a real clean tasting beer, lots of action going on. Some good, some bad.



Good looking golden body, but distict lack of head was disappointing, especially in the wake of what appeared to be some lively carbonation. As others have observed, a certain amount of ""flatness"" to the beer. Aroma's are very low key, some alcohol and little else especially distinguishable.



Goes down real easy, but there is a slight chemical feel to the brew. A bit of an aftertaste that is difficult to place, perhaps metallic, perhaps hoppy, I'm not sure.



Definitely dry in the finish and the aftertaste, not a very pleasant way to leave the palate. Mouthfeel has a distinct oily feeling and slight dry, cloying character.



OK, definitely better than average, but not a lot more. Certainly not one to reach for again in a hurry."
Young & Co Brewery PLC,Young's Dirty Dick's Ale,,,English Bitter,5.20%,bottle,4.05,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,4/3/2005,"I spent several years drinking in Dirty Dick's pub in Bishopsgate, in the heart of the City of London in the early 90's, and until I read the label on the back of the bottle I hadn't associated this beer with the pub - now I know.



Nice bottle with the raised glass seal near the neck. I like the corporate branding of Young's beers, they are distinguished.



Light amber pour with a small head. Disapates soon with some limited lacing. Some citrus (possibly) orange in the nose. Very mild hops and not much malt.



This is a low impact beer, and I suspect that for that reason it may not be especially popular in the USA. On the other hand I bet it scores highly in the UK. Because of the mild categorization this has huge potential as a session beer.



Relatively thin in the mouth (on purpose) with a mildly bitter and dryish finish. Slightly metallic but not in an unpleasant way, that just seems to add to the cleanliness of the beer as a whole.



Not Young's best effort, but a solid beer."
Brasserie de Rochefort (Abbaye de Notre-Dame de Saint-Rémy),Trappistes Rochefort 10,,,Quadrupel (Quad),11.30%,bottle,4.85,4,4.5,5,5,5,4/2/2005,"===

The more I reflect on this, the more I like it and the better it gets with warmth. Very important to let this warm in the glass for 30 minutes IMO. Complexity and flavor dramatically increase in that period, and I see the notes I am "
Brouwerij Van Steenberge N.V.,Gulden Draak (Dark Triple),,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,10.50%,on-tap,4.33,4,5,4.5,4,3.5,4/1/2005,"Very deep, dark appearance with an amazing aroma of cherries, dates, other dark fruits and a little gasoline! Very strong spirit/alcohol smell.



This is one serious beer. Lots of character, flavor and an amazing warming effect on its way down. Not much hop character anywhere present, but bowls and bowls of malt fruits and serious alcohol.



Mouthfeel is predictably large with overwhelming texture, bordering on a little too much for me. The sheer richness of the drink as a whole took away slightly from it's drinkability for me, but nevertheless an experiential and exceptional beer.



One you have GOT to try."
"Anheuser-Busch, Inc.",Budweiser Select,,,Light Lager,4.30%,bottle,1.25,2,1,1,2,1.5,3/28/2005,"O.K., I think to an experienced drinker that has tasted the full range of styles over the course of many years, ""products"" like this don't really qualify as ""beer"" at all. Having said that, this is no worse an offender than scores of similar others, but what really irks me is the fact that this is clearly a child of marketing strategy rather than the art of brewing. Ho hum, another example of capitalist America pandering to the masses.



Budweiser Select is certainly a ""clean"" beer. That is definitely on its side, but of course with the excessive crispness and cleanliness comes an almost complete lack of ANY other defining characteristics.



I see a pale, piss colored liquid, over carbonated and with zero head retention beyond maybe 5 seconds (I'm always confused with lots of fizzy bubbles and no head). It's aroma is non-existent (1.0 here means there is none) apart from the classic mild and non-offensive grain malt, and the taste, well I don't detect any (1.0 again for no taste). This stuff is even more non-descript than most of its competitors which is probably why it will be a huge success. 



Presumably Budweier has worked out that the masses don't want taste and therefore don't want real beer. They clearly prefer this processed product. A bit like choosing Velveeta over a classically matured, vintage English Cheddar. No point in having a discussion about their relative merits, they are simply different things. This is beer????"
Wells & Young's Ltd,Young's Special London Ale,,,Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB),6.40%,bottle,4.83,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,3/28/2005,"Utterly brilliant.



Paler than expected pour, but with a striking clarity, this beer starts out in the glass by telling the drinker that it is delicious. Add in deep malt and hop aromas and you can start drinking this through your nose.



Frothy head with globules of sticky lace adhering to the Young's pint glass that this is displayed in. Perfect hop/malt balance, with more hops coming through in the finish than are present up front. The ending is as smooth as silk.



A classic example of the style, the kind of beer I want to have premanently at hand to remind me of what real beer really is. Having drunk a disappointing beer, or a hopelessly non-descript macro, I could crack one of these and have my faith in beer restored instantly.



Full of English bitter character, it reminds me of real pubs. This kind of art is why I like beer!"
Brouwerij Van Steenberge N.V.,Augustijn Ale,,,Tripel,8.00%,bottle,3.85,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,3/27/2005,"Pale orange pour with loads of soft, ripe fruits in the nose. Not a huge head, but decent with some lacing in my very versatile and much beloved New Belguim glass.
Sweet alcoholic pineapple is where this one sets out it's stall. Quite an acidic and dry finish, with some unexpected astringency.
Quite sharp in the mouth, not through prickly carbonation, but rather through a peppery alcohol and some alcoholic sharpness. A little sting with some bitterness too.
Nice Belgian Tripel but definitely unrefined. A bit edgy, not really for the newbie, and slightly tangy."
Brasserie Caracole,Nostradamus,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,9.50%,bottle,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,3/26/2005,"Highly drinkable Belgian that drinks way below it's 9.5%. I could drink a gallon of this stuff without noticing it (at least until the next day!)



Dirty brown pour with a charateristic large, forthy, rocky white head. Carbonation is high at first but dies down significantly so this is not a problem. Great appearance and nice lacing.



Lovely, rich and creamy mouthfeel. Really full in the mouth and the combination of fruit and carbonation is a real treat.



Heavy fruits and other esters lace this beer from beginning to end, but are especially prevelant as it warms slightly. Some spices in the background too but these a muted. A little driness in the finish, but hardly noticeable.



Great, great value at $5.99 for a 750 mL corked and caged bottle. Solid example."
Dinkelacker-Schwabenbraeu AG,Dinkel Acker Dark,,,Munich Dunkel Lager,?,bottle,3.08,3.5,2.5,3,3.5,3.5,3/26/2005,"Clear dark brown pour with a frothy, ""gone all too quickly"", head. Very little aroma but that may be related to this serving temperature.



This has a low malt profile and a distinct lack of any hop character. If you put this together with the all too familiar frozen cold serving you have a pretty bland beer. However, on warming a little some creaminess, sweetness and more malts come through.





Mouthfeel and body above average, but not great.



Pretty drinkable if somewhat unspectacular, another beer destined for ""better than macro but nothing special"" status. Shame, potentially much more to offer."
Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Weihenstephaner Korbinian,,,Doppelbock,7.40%,bottle,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,3/25/2005,"Dark, malty pour and aroma, the beer looks great and promises much.
Not as sweet as some others in the style that I have tried and there was a very dinstict biscuit or cookie backbone. Almost like some crumbled shortbread had been put into the glass at some stage - very nice. Very well balanced.
Classic full mouthfeel and smooth finish. Nice ABV level that matched well with the carbonation to provide a very satisfying drink. If anything this drinks a little bigger than the 7.40% advertised."
Dinkelacker-Schwabenbraeu AG,Dinkel Acker Cd-Pils,,,German Pilsener,4.90%,bottle,3.38,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3/25/2005,"Solid Pilsener - not my favorite, but a good example.



The simple, pale yellow relatively unattractive typical pour, with an initially lively head that's gone in seconds. Little or no lacing.



Typical crisp, dry hop bitterness of the style, with grain and alcohol in the nose. A little fuller in the mouth than I was expecting too.



Decent refreshing snap - must be super cold for full effect."
Firestone Walker Brewing Co.,Double Barrel Ale,,,English Pale Ale,5.00%,bottle,3.83,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,3/23/2005,"Elaborate and informative labels, looks classy.



This definitely felt more like Pale Ale than an Amber, with its pale orange appearance, mild lacing and decent head. Not much nose to speak of, but a little bit of citrus hoppiness present.



As others have observed, a dry hoppy character that had definite tea flavors noticeable. The tea thing was really quite obvious to me.



A little gassy, with carbonation slightly above average, but a clean dry finish without the astringency that some hop based finishes can have."
Bison Brewing Co.,Bison Organic Gingerbread Ale,,,Herbed / Spiced Beer,6.00%,bottle,3.1,4,3,3,2.5,3.5,3/21/2005,"Label describes this as a medium-bodied Porter but I don't see it in that light at all - far too light.



Definite garnet color in the pour with a light and fluffy head. Not much lacing to speak of. I'm afraid I simply didn't get any strong cinnamon, spiced or gingerbread aroma's or tastes at all. In fact the whole experience was very subdued and a little flat.



Not a bad beer, but rather disappointing, I was expecting a much firmer body and some bolder tastes. Instead I got a drinkable, but light beer, with a little molasses and a dryish background.



Very light mouthfeel, the deep color in the glass is a little misleading.



I read the reviews of this before I drank it and was expecting a massively flavored beer to come flying at me out of the bottle. Perhaps the hype was just too much, but I felt this was a lightweight brew that missed a chance for something special."
Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Grottenbier,,,Belgian Dark Ale,6.50%,bottle,4.08,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,3/20/2005,"Poured into the St. Bernardus Chalice with a mid-dark brown body, a fantastic looking half-inch creamy, dense head with excellent lacing that fades to a stout-like, spotty and creamy film. Carbonation is very nice with miniscule bubbles making up the head. A damn good looking beer.
Lots of balance with malts and hops competing for the palate's attention, but not as complex as it first appears. Actually a distinct lack of fruitiness, but some definite dark, dry and bitter highlights especially in the finish.
Solid example with less fruit than I was expecting, and more dry bitterness, but very drinkable. Real beer! Depth, character and taste. Not quite up to the hype, but that's difficult; nonetheless a nice brew."
Stakhanovitz,Bogemia,,,Euro Pale Lager,8.40%,bottle,3.55,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3/14/2005,"$2.49 Chapel Hill Package Store, Douglasville, GA, USA.



Very clear yellow pour out of the 1 pint 0.9 fl oz bottle with green labels. Labels say it is brewed and bottled by OAO Krasny Vostok Brewery, Kazan, Russia.



Aroma exactly like cider. Lots of apples, but only a hint of the alcohol that is in this relatively strong brew. Low carbonation, so low in fact it soon resembles something that is quite flat.



Alcohol is prominent in the taste with some astringency and dryness in the aftertaste. A bit of a kick in the finish too. Some creaminess in the mouthfeel.



Definitely not a run of the mill beer in the style, some really quite strong alcohol and malts in the taste make this one stand out a little from the crowd. Good dry finish, an interesting animal."
Rogue Brewery (Brewer's on the Bay),Buckwheat Ale,,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,4.80%,bottle,3.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,3/13/2005,"At last, a well balanced Rogue beer - strange that it comes in such an unusual brew.



Deep golden orange pour with a substantial head. Lacing is good, but the head fades quickly. I would describe this as a ""malt IPA"", meaning it has hop IPA characteristics, and it has the appearance of a solid IPA, but shows at the same time it exhibits more sweet malt balance that takes it somewhat out of the IPA style.



Some citrus notes, but they are very muted, but this is still a very drinkable beer. Nice full mouthfeel with a perfect level of carbonation to show off the taste.

Personally I like the packaging - the minimal neck label and the clear bottle. I know most will dislike the glassware, but I think it makes for a pleasant visual change. The beer looks good in the bottle.



Cream Ale? Well I'm not sure about that. I suspect that this has had sufficient adjunts added to make it not much more or less than a macro adjunct lager.



Slight skunkiness in the smell (alright - clear glass, I know) - but to be truthful this is no worse than many other macro's in dark glass. Good looker with a nice head, but the tatstes are utterly non-descript.



Typical lack of body as one would expect from a North American macro, no distinct aromas and instantly forgetable in most respects.



One thing in its favor - a clean aftertaste. Lawnmower potential but not much else."
Tuborgs Bryggerier A/S,Tuborg Premium Lager (Gold / Guld),,,Euro Pale Lager,5.00%,bottle,2.73,4,2.5,2.5,3,3,3/13/2005,"Haven't seen any Tuborg around for the best part of 25 years! I was amazed when I saw it, and my interest was aroused simply because I assumed it had been discontinued long, long ago. I only recall the green label in the past, not this gold label stuff.



Vaguely attractive olive green bottle and a lovely looking greenish/yellow pour. Good head (for a few seconds) fading quickly to show no lacing.



The smell and the taste were very odd. I kept sniffing and sipping for ages before I got it. The major sensation was that of cooked tomatoes. Slighly sulfurous too.



On reflection I've missed very little over the last 25 years and wouldn't bother with this again."
Unibroue,Quelque Chose,,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,8.00%,bottle,4.08,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,3/12/2005,"Very, very interesting beer experience. This is different in the extreme and a very brave brew from Unibroue in my opinion.
Deep brownish red color, with no sign of a head. My wife described it as flat iced tea, and that is a pretty accurate description of what you see.
There is immense sweet and sour tartness that come together in the flavor. A bit like the old lager and blackcurrant mixing days of my adolescence; a bit of cider in there too and finally a bit of the Lidemanns lambic cassis. A really rounded fruit, sweet and tart experience with some additional mulled wine spices evident as well.
Mouthfeel and alcohol kick are both good and noticeable.
I like this, but it is similar to Champagne in as much as I would not want top have too much of it. Drag this beer out for an ocassion when you simply want a change of pace or alternatively to surprise someone with something REALLY different."
Carlow Brewing Company,Curim Gold Celtic Wheat Beer,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,4.30%,bottle,1.85,2,1.5,2,2.5,1.5,3/11/2005,"Oh dear. Dark orange hazy pour with a fast receding head that lasted for all of 15 seconds. OK, so far, not so good, but not a disaster either - but wait...
An extremely odd, hard to place unpleasant artificial aroma - something plastic I think. Not good.
Nasty, overly acidic sourness that was not at all nice. Funny aftertaste completes the package.
Worst ""craft"" beer I've drunk in a very, very long time."

(If it looks like a duck...). If not, please enlighten me.



&lt;EDIT: 03/10/05 - Jason changed it to Adjunct - cheers&gt;



The context that I drank this in says it all. I enjoyed it with a lunchtime, Mexican meal and it was served to me as probably the coldest beer I have ever come across, in a super-frosted mug. In that context it was fine.



Very little expected and very little required. Cold, refeshing with a lack of skunk and a clean aftertaste is all I expect and ask. This just about covered those bases so I was happy. Of course, you could probably spend less for the same non-experience, but I'm not complaining.



In the right context (lawnmower/100 degree heat/hot spicy food) this does what it is supposed to and nothing more. In that context it is very drinkable."
Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),Samuel Adams Double Bock (Imperial Series),,,Doppelbock,9.50%,bottle,4.4,4,4.5,4,5,5,3/10/2005,"Thick looking, malty monster, with an amazing dense cascading bubble laden head. There is minimal lacing. Beautiful mahogany, amber crystal clear pour.
Very round, full mouthfeel as the layered malts compete for your senses attention. Obviously bags of sweetness, malt, alcohol and toffee like caramel flavors.
I like this a lot, because I am a huge fan of the style, but the whole beer still feels somewhat disjointed to me. In one mouthful there is a cacophony of competing flavors. It's all a bit jumbled up to be honest and leaves me feeling slightly dissatisfied. 
I think this is just young. Lay a few of these puppies down for a couple of years and return to see the results. A micro/macro cellaring experiment is required I feel."

Mild cloves and alcoholic bananas in the nose as one would expect, plus a rather unepected rubber smell!!



Mouthfeel is rather thin. I think this is a trait in the style that continues to surprise me. When I look a these Dunkels they always promise a much deeper body than I get - even though that appears to be par for the course, I am still surprised.



Good malts but also some really quite bitter notes too. Unusual.



Not my favorite style, but a good solid example. Scores here are trying to reflect the style raher than my personal tepid feel for these beers."
Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company,Leinenkugel's Red,,,Vienna Lager,4.90%,bottle,3.98,3.5,4,4,4,4,3/10/2005,"Good looking and better than average beer all around.



Distinct red tinges to the pour and a decent looking head with some better than expected lacing.



This is a pretty malty beer and I expect the name will fool lots of people. Obviously not a ""red"" as such, this shows more depth and character than those often disappointing brews.



Definte hops do a great job at balancing the brew and it has the unusual combination of malt sweetness and clean refreshing bite. Quite a difficult combination to pull off, and perhaps accidental.



Nice brew. Great cross-over potential to get your macro loving friends to try something a bit better, a bit different, but not too frightening!"
Brouwerij Van Steenberge N.V.,Bornem Triple,,,Tripel,9.00%,bottle,3.9,4,4,4,4,3.5,3/9/2005,"Light golden pour with a small, frothy head that largely disappears fairly quickly. There is some persistent light film on the body, and some minor lacing as it sits in the New Belgium goblet.



Tons of alcohol in the nose, with a sinus clearing effect! There are lots of fruits present too. The fruit is reflected in the taste, with a sherry like alcohol ripeness being the predominant taste. Some darker fruit and some pineapple present as well.



There is no doubt about the alcohol content here, and a little more disguising would probably help.



Quite dry finish which I suspect is in line with the alcohol content, but not especially pleasing.



Nice beer, needs some smoothing out I feel."
"Cervecería Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma, S.A. de C.V.",Bohemia,,,German Pilsener,5.30%,bottle,2.7,3,2,3,3,2.5,3/8/2005,"Pale yellow, urine like, macro adjunct appearance and a very odd ""wet dog"" like aroma.



Bland all the way through. I wasn't expecting much and that's pretty much what I got. The strange skunky aroma carried on into the aftertaste that I found very odd - a sort of dry, hop-based bitterness that I was not expecting in the beer.



Decent refreshing quality, cold and sweet, but nothing to endear it to me or to make me rush back. The skunk and the aftertaste detracted from the clean, crispness that I'm looking for in a lighter lager beer."

Yakima Brewing Co. / Bert Grant's Ales,Bert Grants Lazy Days Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),5.00%,bottle,3.15,3,3,3,2.5,4,3/8/2005,"100% unmemorable beer. Average scores most of the way across the board.



Light orange pour with a fast receeding head despite an aggressive pour. Some malts and biscuit in the nose, and a very mild, sweet taste initially. A little hop bitterness in the finish, but not much to speak of.



Possible cross-over beer - not because it is particulalry good, but it would serve two purposes. It might open up the macro crowd's eyes to the possibility of investigating some micro's, and secondly it is very mild, bland and 100% unoffensive.



Very drinkable too but I really can't see this appealing to experienced BA's too much."
Lagunitas Brewing Company,Hairy Eyeball Ale,,,American Strong Ale,9.00%,bottle,4.2,5,4,4,4.5,4.5,3/7/2005,"Subsequently (just arrived in GA Feb 2 2007) 12 oz bottle at Taco Mac, Marietta, GA, USA. $5.00.



A litle more ethanol in the finish than I remember from the past. It drinks less smooth than Brown Shugga (for example) desite the BS being a higher ABV.



Very attractive, dark amber/copper pour with a lovely ivory colored, tight head. Great looking beer. 



Aroma's are malty and significant alcohol, but tempered by the sugary sweetness that comes through strong. A ""warm"" aroma - very inviting.



This is a highly drinkanle BW that gets my vote ahead of something like Bigfoot simply because the emphasis here comes down on the malt side rather than the hop side. Hops are there, but they are balanced nicely to give a much more drinkable and satisfying brew than some other American ""English"" BW's. Full in the mouth, with less viscous oilyness than many other similar beers.



Nice experience and another example of the exceptional work that Laguntias is doing out on the West Coast."
Rio Grande Brewing Company,Cabezon Stout,,,American Stout,?,bottle,3,4,4,3,1.5,2.5,3/7/2005,"Picked this up as a single bottle on the clearance shelf. This beer was originally brewed by Cabezon but was swallowed up by Rio Grande when the Cabezon outfit closed. I'm not sure if they are still brewing this, or if this was a bottle left over from the original brewer, but I've added it at Todd's suggestion.



Good looking pour, jet back with a lovely tan head. The head fades quickly to reveal a creamy, spotty layer on the surface of the body. The fact that there is no lacing gives away the fact that the beer is incredibly thin. There is virtually no body to this beer, it's terribly weak and watery and as a result the mouthfeel for a Stout is very, very poor.



Outside of that the smell is good with lots of burned chocolate notes and some smoke. However the appearance and smell are let down first by the taste (similar to, but not as deep as the aroma) and then by the mouthfeel (hopelessly weak).



Very watery experience that promised much more but failed to deliver."
Flying Dog Brewery,Horn Dog Barley Wine Style Ale,,,English Barleywine,10.50%,bottle,3.6,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3/6/2005,"Dark orange pour, typical for the style with minimal head and some, but very little lacing. Typical BW appearance.
Aroma is all dark fruit. Smells a bit like a doppelbock with those very distinct dried fruit aromas coming through strong.
Mouthfeel is very viscous and lubricant like. Slightly off-putting, you probably couldn't drink a lot of this beer for that reason alone. Lots of alcohol all over the place and it is quite prominent, but I don't mind that (in fact I expect it) in this style. Slightly unbalnced becasue of the alcohol randomness.
Definite ""sipper"" for me, OK example of the style but there are better."
Lagunitas Brewing Company,Censored (aka The Kronik),,,American Amber / Red Ale,5.90%,bottle,4.13,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,3/6/2005,"Bottle first, then subsequently on draught at Taco Mac, Marietta, GA, USA - $5.00.



Beautiful pour, clear as a bell with a deep orange/copper hue that is typical of a big-hopped IPA, except this isn't!



Some lovely malt sweetness in the nose and perfect balance in the initial tastes complement what your palate is anticipating from the aroma. Lots of hops present, but they are nicely tempered by a rich brown sugar, molasses syrup.



Mouthfeel is full, aftertaste is mild grapefruit hops but they fade nicely to leave a rich creaminess with a little edge but no harshness. Balance again is the watch word.



Reminds me of a tempered Barleywine, but more drinkable. Strong enough to let you feel it, but not strong enough for your to realize exactly how potent it is.



Very nice brew."
Wells & Young's Ltd,Young's Oatmeal Stout,,,Oatmeal Stout,5.20%,bottle,4.65,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,5,3/6/2005,"A work of art. This is a beer that is very unusual in its ability to stay perfectly within style (and be classic example of the genre), and at the same time be able to transcend the style and have a huge appeal even to those who do not especially like Stouts.



Does that make any sense? Well, what I am trying to say is that this beer is so good, I'd be very surpised if anybody disliked it, even those not especially fond of the style.



Lovely, ""noisy"", bubbly, thick, viscous pour with a beautiful, small, thick head that forms quickly. Just like an ice-cream float. The head fades quickly to that lovely creamy, spotted film on top of the black/brown body.



Lots of biscuit in the aroma, some sweet malts come through too. The mouthfeel is perfect, with just the right amount of ""chewiness"" combined with smooth as silk, creamy Stout character.



A little smokiness in the taste, but it's mainly sugary chocolate with some cereal edges to remove the sweetness.



Delicious - a classic."
Slavutych Brewery,Slavutych Pivo (Slavutich Premium),,,American Adjunct Lager,5.00%,bottle,2.25,1.5,2,2.5,2.5,2,3/4/2005,"Very odd looking beer that appeared like an extremely weak, insipid looking cross-breed of a wheat beer and a macro lager. There was also some yeasty sediment in the pour that refused to settle down, making lots of odd swirling motions in the glass even after it was left undisturbed. All mildly alarming. Some good continual carbonation from the bottom of the glass.



Medium sized frothy head that didn't last long and left me with a slightly skunked, macro lager with nothing much to endear it to me. Not horrible, but the appearance put me off and the skunk was not very appetizing.



Quite sweet and quite refreshing, but a chalky aftertaste spoiled the experience (was this the mysterious swirling sediment?). 



Glad I tried it, but I think that will be the first and last time."
Brasserie Caracole,Saxo,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,8.00%,bottle,3.98,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,2/28/2005,"$5.99 for a 750 mL, corked and caged brown bottle. Excellent value.



Typically pale Belgian, with all the usual characteristics. Super, pale yellow pour in my Duvel tulip with a lovely frothy head and some minor lacing. Final pour incorporates the remainder of the yeast to add to the body and taste. The Duvel glass helps the head by focusing the carbonation, but still a lovely looking pour.



Quite spicy with lots of cloves present. The beer is overall really quite acidic and had a fairly dry finish too.



Mouthfeel is average with the alcohol well disguised. For me this drinks well below its 8.00% ABV.



If you can pick this up at the $5.99 price tag then you'll have a very solid, decent ABV, authentic Belgian at an excellent price."
Brasserie Dupont sprl,Saison Dupont,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,6.50%,bottle,4.58,5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,2/27/2005,"Delicious example of the style, well balanced, easy drinking and a treat to behold.



First the pour; beautiful, hazy golden looker, with a tremendous rocky, white head (as advertised on the bottle). Super carbonation makes the beer look beautiful in my small ""Mad Elf"" tulip.



Smells, slightly organic (grassy, herby), but the main attraction is a buttery, apple, alcohol smell - classic country cider in the nose. Mouthfeel is wonderful with carbonation, alcohol and body all second to none.



Yeast, fruits come through loud and clear, some tartness and coupled with an amazing warming apple/alcohol dry ending, this truly is a magnificent example of the Saison."
Privatbrauerei Franz Inselkammer KG / Brauerei Aying,Ayinger Oktober Fest-Märzen,,,Märzen / Oktoberfest,5.80%,bottle,3.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,1.5,3.5,2/27/2005,"Extremely disappointing and rather ordinary.



Hazy orange pour with a small, instantly forgettable head and a tiny bit of lacing. Some marzipan (almond paste) in the nose and quite smooth, but depertately lacking in body and substance. In fact, really quite watery.



Deeply disappointing mouthfeel, and rather than a beer that you might enjoy in October has the days get cooler and you appreciate a little more ""ummpff"" in your beer, this brew slacks off and lets you down. An O-fest in need of some Viagra!



Poor example, if somewhat drinkable."
Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout,,,Russian Imperial Stout,7.00%,bottle,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,2/27/2005,"A definite viscosity in the pour, that, coupled with the opaque blackness, lets you know that you are in for something of genuine quality.



Pour is classic, black stout black, with a small, bubbly head that ultimately fades to the type of head I love on a Porter or Stout - that classic, spotty, creamy, tan film that lingers and laces the glass.



Initial notes are of depth. Deep, bitter flavors of cooking chocolate - that really bitter, cocoa flavor, a small amount of smoke - but very little, and some dark fruits like raisins or plums? 



Drinkability is high, with smoothness and satisfaction being the most important factors in the ease of consumption. Alcohol level is nicely hidden in the hop malt balance, but still has enough clout to make you feel like you consumed a relatively high ABV beer.



Very satisfying and largely pleasureable."
Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),Samuel Adams Black Lager,,,Schwarzbier,4.90%,bottle,3.6,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,2/24/2005,"Brown/black pour with a head that quickly turns to a spotty cream on the surface of the beer and some minimal lacing. A little sweet rounded coffee in the nose, but also a very sweet sensation in the aroma and the up-front tastes.



I would describe this as a lactose-milk, carbonated Porter! Does that make sense? Well, if not, it's sweet, dark, light and easy drinking with a nice mouthfeel and satisfying end. Definitely some roastiness in there, but this only develops on the way through the beer and is not very evident upfront.



I'm not over familiar with the style, but it reminds me of a sweetish Porter without the creaminess. Nice beer, I'd certainly visit again."
Mythos Breweries S.A.,Mythos Hellenic Lager Beer,,,Euro Pale Lager,5.00%,bottle,3.88,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,2/24/2005,"Ordinary, but smooth, non-descript but refreshing, simple but clean.



Standard macro looking pour, but a really nice head with some lacing. This is an ordinary lager and an ordinary product in general, but I really enjoyed it. I ask very little of my lagers - smooth and clean, crisp and refreshing. It comes through on all counts with some extra bonus points on the way through too.



Quite a nice, full mouthfeel considering the style, with a nice level of carbonation and some very surprising creaminess. Very good!



A nice beer, that although I would not seek it out, I would definitely happily order, buy and drink again. Another pleasant surprise on the BA journey!"
Brouwerij Huyghe,Delirium Tremens,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,8.50%,bottle,3.88,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,2/23/2005,"Very unusual and attractive looker, with at first, a deceptively ordinary macro lager look, but a closer observation reveals a slightly cloudy, quite viscous solution. Zero head retention and zero lacing were a little more disappointing.



There's a definte syrupy, alcoholic, sugar consistency in the mouthfeel, and this is reflected in the taste. Strong, warming alcohol comes through with a lot of fruit. A little dry, at the finish and a definite strong ending of alcohol and apples. Slightly metallic too, but not in a nasty way.



Not my favorite, Belgian Pale, it's a little to lager-like for me, but it has a kick and the it drinks its full 9.00% ABV."
Brasserie La Binchoise (Malterie des Remparts),La Binchoise Spéciale Noël (Reserve Special - USA),,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,9.00%,bottle,4.28,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,2/20/2005,"Very spicy and bitter with pepper being the most overwhelming sensation for me. There's plenty of other spices in there too, with coriander especially prevelant. Some lemon in the nose as well. 



Dark orange pour with a large, ivory colored head that hangs around some. A little lacing, but nothing to speak of.



This is a a bitter, quite harsh beer, with only very minor fruit character. There are plenty of pineapples and mandarin oranges in the aroma, but very little in the taste. Having said that some solid malts back up the bitterness and as a result this is a serious Belgian with depth and intensity.



High ABV is shielded well, but at the same time you know you are drinking it. Quite a serious beer, not for the non-educated palate or taste. Complex."
Clay Pipe Brewing Company,Backfin Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),5.50%,on-tap,3.78,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,2/20/2005,"Good looking deep yellow pour with a decent head a little sticky lacing.



To me, this drinks much more like a european lager than a APA, as it has the ability to be fairly non-descript and refreshing at the same time. Very clean and sharp all the way around. I enjoyed it.



As others have noted, a very smooth buttery mouthfeel and this is what adds to its drinkability. For some reason, I suspect that this beer is much better on draft than it is from the bottle so I may have seen the best side of this, but I was impressed.



Nice balance, with noticebale hop character, but at the same time, smooth and well hidden. I also suspect that lot of BA's would find this bland and boring, but for once, that's on its side.



Good with food and when you are looking for something refreshing to wash down a meal. Not a great beer, but one that has high drinkability in my book. I was surprised at how much I liked this beer, since it isn't really a beer with much character but it just hit the spot. Perhaps this was just one of those occasions when it simply fit the bill."
Private Weissbierbrauerei G. Schneider & Sohn GmbH,Schneider Aventinus Weizen-Eisbock,,,Eisbock,12.00%,bottle,2.9,2.5,4,2.5,3.5,2.5,2/20/2005,"Dark, dirty brown pour, rather unattractive. Bubbly head forms quickly, but leaves equally quickly. The aroma is all malty alcohol. It's obvious that this is a high alcohol brew, but 12% still seems mighty high.



The initial tastes seem ""Belgian"" to me, almost like a strong dark Belgian, but these fade quickly to give a sugary, rich dry finish.



There is certainly a warming sensation on the way down due to the alcohol, and there are some very sweet pineapple and pear based esters in there in addition to the more obvious cloves and bananas. Frankly I didn't care for this much. A little too much of everything for my taste.



This is also a (relatively) very expensive beer and there are many other examples of similar styles and beers (dopplebocks) that are cheaper and superior."

Half-decent beer that takes you above horrid macro to the start of a very long journey to wonderful micro, but not very far along that path.



Pour is nicely balanced with good, deep orange color and a nice head with some retention. A very small amout of lacing adds to the visiual impact. 



Mild caramel and sugar in the nose and taste, but also with some hop bitterness to even things out. Unusually dry finish brings the beer to a somehat abrupt end! Drinks and looks a little more like an APA than a Red/Amber.



Good stand-by and always should be chosen ahead of BMC, but not much else to endear it."
The Matt Brewing Company,Saranac Black & Tan,,,Black & Tan,5.40%,bottle,3.65,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,2/20/2005,"Good looking beer with a nice balance of malt and hop bitterness that makes it very drinkable. There's a warm, bread like feeling in the mouth which is very full and satisfying in a way that I was not expecting. Some burned malts in the aroma.



Stout like appearance, with a tan head sitting on the black/reddish body. Some lively carbonation out of the bottle, but this fades quickly to reveal a more average looking dark beer.



A mild finish with neither the malt nor the hops dominating. A little dry at the end for my taste that takes away some of the anticipated smoothness.



Not a big fan of pre-bottled Black and Tans, in fact not big fan of Black and Tans period, but this was better than I was expecting."
The Matt Brewing Company,Saranac India Pale Ale,,,American IPA,5.80%,bottle,3.7,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,2/17/2005,"Here's my best guess. If this beer was around 15, 10 or even 5 years ago (I don't know if it was), it would have enjoyed a much higher profile and status than it now does. It's a very servicible IPA as it stands in 2005, but it's really lost in what seems to be the ever increasing micro American IPA market. What might have been cutting edge in the past seems mundane now. 



Decent orange based pour with some definite hop aromas coming through strong. This initial promise is soon tempered by a ""flatness"" that overcomes the beer both in terms of its carbonation and the general feel. If you can get past this presentation problem, the finish is surprisingly crisp and dry and points to a better quality product than I was expecting.



Having said all of that, not much more than a decent alternative to macro swill, but a beer that promised more than it actually delivered."
Southern Tier Brewing Company,Phin & Matt's Extraordinary Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),5.40%,bottle,3.55,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,2/15/2005,"Incredibly orange, cloudy pour with a substantial billowing, white head that left some pleasing lacing.
Hoppy aroma that isn't very well replicated in the taste. Typically American Pale Ale in both appearance and taste, this beer is no more or less than a solid example of the style.
Dryish finish compliments the slightly spikey carbonation that hits the tongue at first.
Pretty drinkable and I'd be happy to offer this up to non-BA's as an example of where they could gain entry to the better side of things. Potentially a nice cross-over beer.

O'Hanlon's Brewing Co. Ltd.,O'Hanlons Organic Rye,,,Rye Beer,5.00%,bottle,4.25,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,2/13/2005,"Super. Much less Rye in the taste than others that use it, in fact this really sits in my own category of classic English bitters.
Two separate reviews in one here. First the pour without the yeast; lovely, quite lively carbonated, golden pour. Small head and lots of smooth bitterness up font. Delicious balance with a biting finish and warming aftertaste.
Secondly the pour with the sediment; obviously alters the appearance and cuts back on the bitterness, but still absolutely delicious. Distinct aroma of mown grass and tempered hops.
The Rye lends an initial sweetness that is unusual and fades quickly.
Great label with lots of information including ingredients. A nice, simple note about bottle conditioning too and some information about the beer itself."

Very artificial cherry aroma and flavor is all you get here, and coupled with the alcohol it reminds me of kids cough medicine. That image and sense, are ones that I simply could not get past.



Only one redeeming feature - a good, attractive head and some significant sticky lacing. However, this was probably the cherry syrup making it stick to the side of the glass!



Don't bother with this, there are hundreds of other infinitely better fruit beers out there."
Brasserie d'Achouffe,La Chouffe,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,8.00%,bottle,3.78,4,4,3.5,4,4,2/6/2005,"Pale orange and some chill haze adds to the cloudiness of the pour. A thin but persistent head is present with some mild, fluffy lacing.



Aroma displays Belgian yeast character.



I didn't notice much of the spice that is advertised, but there is a little hint of cloves(?) and some orange. A nice, solid pale Belgian with a decent kick too. Quite ordinary for a quality beer, but goes down well.



This was very expensive ($9.90 for a small bottle - yes I was shafted) and there are a multitude of beers that represent better value. Next time I'll be buying this from a store and not in a bar. Store cost is nearer to $8-$9 for a 750 mL. much, much better value.

Of course, the reason that others will find it a let down, is the same reason that I enjoyed it so much. Subtlety and balanced are in the brew in abundance and its better for it. This is its main strength.



A light orange colored pour, typical for your general IPA and a modest but well formed head meet the eye. The aroma's are subdued, as are the initial flavors, with a simple balance of malt, alcohol, hops and some aniseed like herbs. The hops are barely noticeable (even I have been conditioned by the super-heavy hops of other brews), until the finish. The finish is classically IPA, with a dry, bitter and hopped content that reminds me of the old days! 



A nice, drinkable beer in a more traditional, tempered IPA way."
Brauerei Beck & Co.,Beck's Oktoberfest,,,Märzen / Oktoberfest,5.00%,bottle,3.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,2/5/2005,"Very, very solid example of the style, with good macro type availability and price; this beer is hard to beat from a value and fallback point of view.
Drinks very smooth, with a degree of sweetness that I always associate with the style. It really is a question of hops and bitterness in the nose, followed by malts and smoothness in the mouth.
Good, filling mouthfeel, nice carbonation and a sweet finish.
Typically Marzen, with a refreshing drinkability to it. This is an excellent, (relatively) cheap beer that should make an impression on those expecting much less."

I've been living in Atlanta for the best part of five years, all that time paying close attention to the beer scene, regularly going to all the best stores in the metro area and have been on the ABC brewery tour, and I didn't know this existed until I found it in Mac's downtown on the individual bottle clearance shelf!



Great looking Porter with an amazing aroma coming from the opaque, black body. Chocolate up front, with a hoppy, bitter, smoky finish that follows some excellent smoothness early on.



A lovely drink, with creaminess, body, aroma and looks that the ABC would do well to promote some more! Satisfying and mellow - why did it take me so long to find? Is it new?"

Amazingly light color (for beer anyway) and an aggresively carbonated, fizzy appearance. Nasty skunk in the first whiff, but this does seem to settle down.



There's lots of artificial sweetness and an amazing feeling of consumption of gas with this ""beer"". Nasty carbonation in the mouth and unpleasent aftertaste. Apart from that, not bad!!



Frightening to think that millions of people think this is what beer is!"
Young & Co Brewery PLC,Young's Old Nick Barley Wine Ale,,,English Barleywine,7.20%,bottle,4.55,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,2/4/2005,"This is a lovely beer. From presentation through to pour, from the head through to the appearance, from the color to the body, it's a feast for the senses.



Deep, deep mahogany red coloration, with a good head that is firm and slightly pink in color. Lots of alcohol, but this is very well tempered by the sweet maltiness. Less Barleywine style than some, more of a malt and alcohol explosion.



Very, very full bodied in the mouth with plenty of perfect carbonation. This is a beer I could sit and drink an alarming quantity of, but also feel satisfied after one or two.



Reminded me a lot of the Moretti Birra La Rossa.



Great, slightly stubby bottle completes the experience. Thanks to rajendra82 or the tip!"

7oz bottle getting toward three years old. Very deep malts and lots of sweetness with a hop edge. This stuff seems to be peaking since I can hardly imagine it getting any better. 



Original Review: (Unsure of bottle age).



Delicious.



Pale red pour with a clarity that I found striking and unexpected. Small head that leaves quickly as expected.



Lots of alcohol in the nose, and some distinct hoppiness that suprised me. The taste is not complex to me, just exactly what I was expecting. A solid maltiness which battles with the strong alcohol for your attention. Finishes round and creamy in the mouth and with a distinct dry bite. Nicely done.



Solid example and I like the 7oz bottle - adds to the feeling that you are drinking something a little less ordinary."
Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Maredsous 10 - Triple,,,Tripel,10.00%,bottle,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,1/31/2005,"Excellent presentation with a wonderfully, light, golden color and a massive, rocky, sticky respledent head. A lot of small bubbles make up the impressive head. Very reminiscent of Duvel to look at.



Lots of alcohol in the nose and upfront in the taste. The dominant experience here for me was a apple like, clean dryness. Like a really crunchy Granny Smith. Don't get me wrong, there were no apples in the taste, but a distinctive clean, sharp bite to the beer that I found delicious.



Finish is undoubtabley dry, and won't suit everyone. Distinctly Belgian and very drinkable - be careful with te ABV!



A winner, another beer to savor and delight in."
Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,120 Minute IPA,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,18.00%,on-tap,4.83,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,1/30/2005,"This is a truly super beer - and I don't relish lots of hops.
Great looking ""orangy"" colored pour with a small, but perfectly formed, bubbly head. The look is good, but this brew isn't about looks.
Firstly the aromas are hops, more hops and then some more hops. A rounded, wonderful citrus, floral variety that just seems to hit the perfect balance.
Tastes are mainly grapefruit, but these are tempered citrus tones. Obviously it's more potent than the 60 or 90, but it has the same characteristic subtlety. The tongue gets the full treatment, being bathed in flavor and variety of sensations. There's the citrus, followed by the grass, followed by the fruits, followed by the floral, followed by the crisp, biting hop finish. This drinks nowhere near it's 20.0 odd % ABV, it has been beautifully crafted to mask the alcohol.
A true classic, beautifully and carefully brewed, an example of how to lovingly make quality beer."
Pratt Street Ale House,Oliver's Pagan Porter,,,American Porter,4.90%,on-tap,2.1,2.5,2,2.5,1.5,1.5,1/30/2005,"A weak and pissy beer that lacked any body or creaminess. I thought this was/is a very poor example of the style.



The thin body was the overwhelming experience, to the point of feeling it was watered down. A flat pour with virtually no head, there were some roasted notes in the nose. The most distinguishable taste was that of smoky, burning wood - not something I've encountered before, nor would want to again.



Very disappointing. The thin mouthfeel made whatever little redeeming features this beer had almost indistinguishable."
Brouwerij Boon,Boon Kriek,,,Lambic - Fruit,5.00%,bottle,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,1/29/2005,"The cork almost took my head off as it shot out of the bottle like a bullet and hit the living room ceiling. You have been warned! This was a taste of things to come as the carbonation proved to be very annoying. Even after letting the beer settle and despite some painstakingly careful pouring, the amount of froth and carbonation was excessive making it a pain in the backside to get at.
Anyway, having got it into the glass it looks a dirty red/brown, murky color with a very feint pink froth on top. The froth is persistent. It's somewhat tart, but at the same time sweet (if that's possible) a real sweet and sour experience. The cherries are not obvious to me, apart from the color, in fact it seems like much more of a general fruit experience than a specific one.
Very refreshing and would be an ideal ladies aperitif, but not something I'm going to be drinking a lot of. For me this is OK, but strictly novelty, it's simply too much like a wine cooler for my taste. Not really my idea of ""beer""."
Brouwerij Huyghe,Delirium Noël,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,10.00%,bottle,4.38,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,1/29/2005,"A bit of a pain in the ass to open, with the foil apparent glued to the bottle with Space Shuttle technology!



A paler than anticipated pour with some head that doesn't last long, but turns into a sticky coating on the glass and the surface of the beer that reveals the relatively high alcohol content.



Drinks well below its 10.00% ABV, with a smoothness that is uncharacteristic of such a high ABV brew. It's like a cross between an old ale and a barleywine that has tempered, but still big and rounded. Lots of balance here.



A lot of fruit esters in the taste, some spiciness, but a gentle warming quality. I like this because it is distinctly Belgian, but has other attributes too.



A very interesting departure."
Old Dominion Brewing Co.,Winter Brew 2004,,,Russian Imperial Stout,8.00%,on-tap,2.43,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,2,1/29/2005,"Dark, Porter like appearance, with a very strong alcohol taste. No head, a flat coca-cola like appearance.



The aroma is all alcohol and so are the initial tastes. I found this fairly abrasive with no smoothing out of the alcohol and as a result it was not very drinkable. Some acidity in the mouth too. The alcohol was very porly masked and any subtlety that was supposed to be there in terms of hops or malt was lost on me. Definite lack of smoothness.



Not a very good beer. Perhaps I was thinking of Stone RIS at the time and all comparisons are unfair, but a beer I will not bother going back to."
United Breweries - UB Group,Kingfisher Premium Lager,,,American Pale Lager,4.80%,bottle,3.35,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,1/29/2005,"The only place I drink this is in Indian restaurants and it does make for a simple, heat quenching, late night accompaniment to spicy food. Its clean, refreshing and simple, just the kind of thing that you want to go with your hot food under these circumstances.



I find it difficult to review this because my expectations surrounding it are very low; I just expect it to do a simple job that it continues to do well. On the grand scale of adjunct lagers I like it. Is it a great beer? No, but it ain't bad.



Simple golden color with strong carbonation leading to an attractive head. Of course, this doesn't last long. Then the strength of the beer comes through which is its general ability to be non-smelly and clean. Simple dryish, alcohol and typically mildly bitter finish. Not much to report, but a beer that does what it is supposed to and little else."

There's a lot of richness about this beer which actually reminds me a lot of the Celebrator Doppelbock. Black, thick pour with very little head to speak of after the initial large rocky top that results from an aggressive pour.



Large fruit in the nose and lots of alcohol. This drinks much bigger than its 6.00% ABV.



It's big and full in the mouth, with a definite spirit (liquor) aroma and taste prevalent up front. I like that, some won't.



It warms on the way down too."

No messing about here, this is a solid, powerful brew with no punches pulled and authenticity about the beer that is often lacking in so many other beers.



Here's what I like;



It dark, it's rich, it's satisfying, it's rounded, gives a full mouthfeel, good alcohol content, and an overall experience that is complete.



Plenty of fruity esters, but in the perfect combination with the alcohol to complete the picutre. Oh yes!"

A dense red pour, with plenty of viscosity and thick aroma. All that you would expect from a high ABV beast, some lovely ""legs"" in the glass to give a wine tasters analogy and plenty of upfront alcohol.



There are dense fruits that dominate the initial flavors but this doesn't last long. After that I get plenty of alcohol and a syrupy but drinkable concoction associated with this type of beer. Not a classical Barley Wine, but a drinkable, modern version.

A magnificent meal in a bottle! Delicious, big, thick head with a really chewy overall feeling. Amazing bready experience all the way through.
Theres no doubt here that you are getting a serious beer. From the initial highly aromatic alcohol that reaches the nose, through the richness of the mouthfeel and coating, all the way to the bitter finish and the layered malty sweetness, this is a beer for those who appreciate robust styles. Bitter coffee notes prevelant early in the glass too.
One of the best beers I have had the pleasure of drinking in recent years.
This is the second Stoudts beer that I have been very impressed by.
Great packaging too - Love the label."
The Duck-Rabbit Craft Brewery,Duck-Rabbit Milk Stout,,,Milk / Sweet Stout,5.70%,bottle,3.43,4,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,1/23/2005,"Dark pour with light brown highlights.



Small, tan head that recedes quickly to leave a ring of spotty creaminess around the circumference of the surface.



Definitely a sweet drink, but the sugar is not overpowering and serves to smooth out the bitterness. Its nice, drinkable and tasty, but lacks body and mouthfeel. The upside of that is that the drink is really much more refreshing than similar beers of the same style.



Light, drinkable and enjoyable, but not a heavyweight. A light change."
The Matt Brewing Company,Saranac Pale Ale,,,English Pale Ale,5.50%,bottle,3.53,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,1/23/2005,"Pale orange, small rocky head, with some lacing.



Some lively bubbles continue to rise in the glass. This means the head retention is quite good and the lacing is pretty good. Some up front bitterness, with each mouthful ending with a sharp citrus or grapefruit bitterness.



Clear copper body.



Neither the initial bitterness nor the secondary citrus lasts for long. In fact the beer fades quite quickly to another also ran. Obviously superior to the macro brigade, but otherwise a somewhat non-descript beer. Reminds me a lot of a Sam Adams Lager."
Unibroue,Éphémère (Apple),,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,5.50%,bottle,3.68,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,1/22/2005,"Cloudy, yellow pour with a lovely, substantial head and that obvious apple aroma. I didn't find the apple smell overpowering; don't get me wrong it was strong and noticeable, but it didn't take over the beer for me.



This is an amazingly drinkable beer. I first tried it in the Winter months, so I can only imagine what the drinkability would be like in the high summer. This brew is made for hot weather.



To me it hits an interesting balance between a Wit, a Pilsner and a Fruit beer, that somehow makes it a pretty interesting and worthwhile experience. It combines the best features of all of those styles and somehow (I don't really know how) pulls off a decent brew experience. For all of that, I do find it difficult to take this too seriously, and it does remain strictly in my ""novelty"" category.



A very brave departure, with some success. Good job Unibroue you should get credit for invention."
Brewer's Art,Brewer's Art Resurrection,,,Dubbel,7.00%,on-tap,3.38,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,1/19/2005,"Flavorful certainly, but rather rough around the edges.



This beer lacks a certain subtlety that detracts from its drinkability. That's not to say that it's not a decent drink, but if you are expect a drinkable, smooth, classic Dubbel you're going to be disappointed.



Dark red appearance with lots of harsh alcohol up front. A little out of balance for me, and an aftertaste that lingers more than I cared for it to do.



Worth a try, but a little too harsh for me. Countless better examples of the style out there."
"St. George Brewing Company, The",Golden Ale,,,American Blonde Ale,5.50%,bottle,4.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,1/19/2005,"Very deep golden color, with a little cloudiness in the pour. Good head, but this overshadowed by the exceptional amount of sticky lacing that is left on the glass - truly some of the most extensive lacing that I have seen.



Sweet, sugary aromas and initial tastes, but this very quickly gives way to a dry, crisp, slightly bitter, hoppy finish. An unusual combination of tastes that makes for a very pleasant combination that is both refreshing and satisfying.



Nice, simple beer, very drinkable, overall enjoyable."

This beer truly looks yellow. It' s so yellow, I was expecting to take a gulp and taste lemons! Crowning, classic rocky white head, great retention and lacing, this is a 5 for appearance all the way.



Everything about this beer is slightly hyped-up. The color is a bit deeper than a traditional wit, so are the clove and corriander aromas, as is the mouthfeel and the tastes.



Highly drinkable, it's Hoegaarden on acid!"
Capitol City Brewing,Capitol City Kolsch,,,Kölsch,4.00%,on-tap,1.85,2,2,2,1.5,1.5,1/17/2005,"I'm not all that familiar with the style, but this was still a crushingly disappointing effort all around.



These beers really need to be be produced very carefully otherwise you get marginally better (or sometimes even poorer) versions of adjunct macro's. This was one of thos cases.



Looking for a crisp, biscuity, lively, sweet experience I got nothing like that. A lifeless, macro-like lager that was almost indistinguishable (except the price) from 100 other mass produced beers. Don't bother."
Carolina Brewery,Downtown Trolley Brown,,,English Brown Ale,5.20%,on-tap,2.85,3,3,3,2.5,2.5,1/17/2005,"Extremely ordinary, and I suspect a long way away from the Carolina Brewery's best offering.



Standard color, but seemingly flat appearance with little or no head or lacing. Ordinary maltiness up front, but very vanilla in every respect. Some hop in the finish, but a disappointing effort all around.



Perhaps this varies from batch to batch but I was somewhat let down. Lots of better offerings avaialable here - choose one!"
Carolina Brewery,Old North State Stout,,,American Stout,3.90%,on-tap,4,4,4,4,4,4,1/17/2005,"Delicious example of the American stout. Plenty of dark coffee bitterness is the initial experience followed by some creaminess.



Nose is hoppy, dark and nutty against the backdrop of the truly black coloration. Some extensive lacing too makes for an attractive looking pint.



I'd highly recommend this to both the malt and hop lovers out there since it's one of those beers that manages to pull off the delicate balance between the two tastes very well.



Well worth trying."
Magic Hat Brewing Company,#9,,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,5.10%,on-tap,4.38,4.5,5,4,4.5,4.5,1/17/2005,"If you take this beer for what it is - a fruity extravaganza - and don't ask it to be what it's not - a standard pale ale - then you are likely to be very happy with it.
To me, the apricot thing is not that strong. Don't get me wrong, it's an incredibley fruity beer, but there are many different fruit ester tastes present. I was expecting that, but what I was not expecting was such a delightful creaminess, a super drinkability and a lovely mouthfeel. Leaving the fruit to one side for a moment, those qualities in this beer are exceptional, regardless of the style.
Yes, the fruit IS dominating, and if you generally dislike fruit beers I suspect you'll hate #9, but with it comes a lovely deep orangey color, a thick satisfying motuhfeel, lovely carbonation and a super-refreshing experience.
I would strongly advise you to try it, even if you think it will not be to your liking. Although not a crossover beer as such, this is a beer that has the ability to really open peoples eyes to a different, and perhaps new, experience."

Lots of chocolate and nuts in the aroma, with a little of the advertised herbs.

Finish is more bitter and dry than I was expecting, in fact more dry stout-like.

Excellent, typically hoppy, pale orange color, with some nice (but not extensive) lacing. A lot of sweetness in the aroma. Some lovely, light citrus hops, a refreshing bite, but comes with extra smooth drinkability.



I enjoyed the simplicity of this beer. It was certainly hop based, but it managed to balance out the brew with a subtle malt backbone. The malt was not upfront, but took the edge away nicely for me. I'll definitely be visiting this again soon."
Pratt Street Ale House,Oliver's ESB,,,Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB),6.00%,on-tap,4,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,1/15/2005,"Incredibley simple ESB, and that's its strength.



The pour was like a nitro, with plenty of those minute bubbles of carbonation that produce a tight, creamy and lasting head. Simple brown coloration - very clear. Aroma is very muted, as are the initial tastes.



This beer benefits a great deal from warming up to room temperature. The cold serving temperature seems to mute everything about the beer. As it warms, the balance of malt and hops beginings to be more evident and intensifies the experience.



Outside of that it's a simple beer, highly drinkable, a nice example of the stlye and something you are not likely to be disappointed by."
Clipper City Brewing Co. / Heavy Seas Beer,Clipper City McHenry Lager,,,American Pale Lager,4.50%,on-tap,2.65,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,3,1/14/2005,"This is a 100% forgettable, non-descript, adjunct that has only one redeeming feature - it's no worse than many other similar beers.



The standard pale yellow, instantly disappearing head reveals the usual corny, grainy aroma and taste. I would find it impossible to distinguish this from hundreds of other adjuncts or macro lagers. Since this is a being brewed by a smaller brewer, it's a shame they have chosen to take the low road and not take the time and trouble to create something worthwhile. Largely a waste of valuable brewing time."
Moosehead Breweries Ltd.,Moosehead Lager,,,American Pale Lager,5.00%,bottle,3.45,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,1/9/2005,"An unspectacular beer that manages to do what it is supposed to do and little more.



On the up side, unlike many of its counterparts, it manages to pull off a very crisp, clean feel and remains non-offensive. When I break open a bottle of adjunct/macro/cheap North American lager I'm looking for a beer that will quench thirst, give a clean taste and not be skunked. That's about the size of my expectations and Moosehead just about manages that.



Outside of that, almost nothing to report, the beer being non-offensive is about enough for me.



Golden pour, fast forming foaming head which is quick to fade. Some alcohol in the aroma, mixed with a very mild hop/malt balance that is simple and pleasant.



Crisp and clean finish."

This is a difficult beer to get my head around. There are many competing, opposite characteristics that make it really quite complex.



On the downside it felt very light bodied, with a thin mouthfeel. However, the initial disappointment of the lack of body seemed to be immediately compensated for in the lovely light drinkability (for a 7% ABV beer) that came with it.



Then there was the lovely, thick headed pour that initially met me, but after a few minutes the beer had disintegrated into a flat, diet coke type appearance.



This was followed by the next positive experience that was a fruitiness to the definite hop character that I find difficult to pin down, but I like very much. Th hop bitterness was almost simultaneously added to by a layered strong, but subtle alcohol sensation - very nice.



The finish reminded me of a whiskey and water, a sort of dilute spirit taste.



Not as good as the Tripel in my opinion, and anyway it's a different beer, but well worth a try. A complicated beer, that will need an experienced palate to fully appreciate."
Yakima Brewing Co. / Bert Grant's Ales,Bert Grant's Perfect Porter,,,English Porter,4.00%,bottle,3.65,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,1/8/2005,"Well, the name certainly doesn't hold back, and whether this is the ""perfect porter"" or not is in serious doubt in my opinion, but all the same, it's an enjoyable beer. Standard Porter appearance, with the highlights for me the very distinct smoky, chocolate taste and the very nice carbonation/mouthfeel.



I find that lots of beers, in several different categories, mention chocolate, but often the taste can be difficult to pick up. Not here. I was pleasantly surprised by the obvious sweetness and smooth mouthfeel. 



A little on the light side for me, with a low ABV and a little thin, but the thin mouthfeel seemed to be compensated for by the close to perfect carbonation.

The reason I liked this so much was the true to style interpretation. There was a noticeable dryness in the finish of this stout that suggested care and quality. I was happily surprised.



Nice looking, black with red highlights in the pour, with a really, really dark tan head. Very attractive. Some caramel in the nose and then moves quickly on to lots of brown sugar and a hint of smoked chocolate. Sweetness is gone very quickly though, to reveal the dry ending and a lip-smacking finish.

This is a fine example of the style, good smooth body (which is really the most imortant part of the style for me) which made it very drinkable.



Lovely opaque black pour, but smaller than I would have liked head. Initial toasty malts are present that lend the beer a warmth that attracts you into the taste.

To me this is VERY typically French, and much more of Euro style lager than a Belgian.



Label and bottle give a very rustic, farmhouse packaging look. Not sure if this is deliberate or designed (I expect), but it works for me.



Very rich, astringent alcohol taste that is so common in French beers. All the way up from Kronenborg 1664 to the craft beers this is a very common and recognizable trait. This is reflected in the aromas too, with a strong alcohol/spirit presence.



The beer iself remains incredibly drinkable and smooth despite the obvious alcohol domination.



Good, white, rocky head sits atop the crystal clear golden lager pour. A little lacing, but like the head, its all gone far too quickly. Very refreshing, but this has a definite kick, and has the potential to leave a chemical headache the next day. Not a beer to have too many of, it will catch up with you."

A deep, orange colored, cloudy pour (much darker than is usual for the style) with a huge head with fantastic retention, and excellent lacing. This looks like a beautiful beer in the glass and continues to impress on the way down.
Very distinct aroma of apples or cider greets the nose. There is a very grassy, noticeably organic smell that is consistent with an excellent example of the style.
Delicious mouthfeel, full, perfect carbonation and a lovely, unexpected alcohol finish. Left me wanting more, always a good sign."
Spaten-Franziskaner-Bräu,Franziskaner Hefe-Weisse,,,Hefeweizen,5.00%,bottle,3.93,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,12/29/2004,"Distinctly better than average offering, true to the style and delightfully refreshing.



Pour is classically cloudy gold, with the distinctive, large rocky foamed head. Very little lacing though that somewhat surprised me. 



Fruit aromas start this and overshadow the expected clove and herbal notes. I don't a large amount of the classic banana, but more general fruitiness which is a nice change from the norm. This is a much smoother and sweeter experience than I was expecting. In fact, as the beer goes down the glass it reminds me less of a Hefe and more of a quality lager.



Nice level of carbonation and smoothness lend this beer a good drinkability."
Hilton Head Brewing Company,Pub Light,,,Light Lager,?,on-tap,1.13,1.5,1.5,1,1,1,12/28/2004,"Oh dear. My best guess is that the Hilton Head Brewing Company has made a calculated decision that the production of a light lager is what the folks want, and that this has the potential to be a commercial success that exploits the ignorance of the masses.



This is utter garbage. The whole experience, from appearance through to aftertaste, combines all the charms and depth of Bud, Aspen Edge, Michelob Ultra and Spring Water. A real treat!



Pale, with lots of initial carbonation, the brew then rapidly resembles nothing more than frightened water. Zero character. I suppose one could say that this beer is at least fatihful to the style, but it's a disaster zone for BA's.



It's a shame, because they make some decnt beer here, but why one would waste time actualy brewing something like this is beyond me. I know nothing about the brewing process, so perhaps this is an incredibly difficult style to produce and as such requires great skill. If it is a difficult skill to perfect, then it hides that fact well - this beer gives the impression that it could have been whipped up in your garage at home within 24 hours. Horrible, but I bet it sells well!"
Hilton Head Brewing Company,Calibogue Amber,,,American Amber / Red Ale,?,on-tap,3.88,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,12/28/2004,"Slightly cloudy, amber appearance with a decent head and some lacing.



Fairly serviceable amber with a mainly malt character and some hop bitterness in the finish. This is a potenatial session beer just from the point of view that it is easy drinking and straightforward.



Not impressed, but at the same time not disappointed. 100% better than, but reminded me a lot of Killians. This beer benefits from a slight temperature raise rather than the ultra-chilled servings that you normally get at the bar.



Carbonation is just about right and a simple, steady mouthfeel. Confident to fall back on this beer when at HHBC."
Yuengling Brewery ,Yuengling Traditional Lager,,,American Amber / Red Lager,4.40%,on-tap,2.93,3.5,3,3,3,2.5,12/28/2004,"A very simple beer that barely out-performs a macro. The color is obviously more attractive than BMC, but the head (virtually non-existent), the serving temperature (too often Arctic temperatures) and the tastes (muted to say the least) all resemble non-descript swill.
Unlike most of those macros, this benefits from warming up. This begins to release a little hop-aroma and a small (if somewhat weak) malt backbone.
Mouthfeel is decent, with some carbonation that renders it pretty smooth and drinkable, but outside of that nothing to report. 
I understand the attraction, loyality and tradition associated with this beer, but quite frankly is just above average. If it's this or macro, take it, under better circumstances probably pass. I was disappointed but not surprised by the mediocrity."
Hilton Head Brewing Company,JW's Stout,,,American Stout,?,on-tap,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,4,12/27/2004,"A decent if somewhat thin offering. Good appearance, with a foamy, bubbly thin head thst diappated quickly. Very little lacing. There were some spicy, chicory flavors up front and a body that was preetty drinkable and not substantial. the alcohol comes through in a pleasing way, but strong, but it's there.



No real chewiness associated with this stout, but a nice Sunday lunchtime drink. You could drink this in fairly large quantities because of it's light body, or alternatively just have a couple.



Nothing to write home about, but nevertheless a pleasing find amongst the BMC that's on the rest of the Island."
Stone Brewing Co.,Stone Imperial Russian Stout,,,Russian Imperial Stout,10.50%,bottle,4.65,5,4,5,4.5,4.5,12/24/2004,"What a great surprise. A sweet, delicious, thick treacle like beer that drank superbly and left an amazing feeling of well being and satisfaction.
Poured into a Westmalle chalice to reveal a thick, inky blackness that has yet to be matched by just about anything I can remember pouring - except black ink! Small tan head that left quickly to leave a classic, spotty cream film over the surface of the beer. Looks like a small oil slick in the glass!
An interesting juxtaposition of complex notes and apparent simplicity. Some molasses, but it's on the sweet side rather than the burned side; a touch of caramel as well.
The surprise about the whole brew to me is the lack of bitterness and the upfront sweetness. I was a expecting a much harsher, drier experience. Lots of sugar molasses and a wonderfully controlled ABV. Great brewing!

Three Floyds Brewing Co. / Brewery & Pub,Alpha Klaus Christmas (Xmas) Porter,,,American Porter,6.00%,bottle,3.08,3.5,3,3,2.5,3.5,12/22/2004,"Well, another beer where the reputation has gone before it on BA, and the actual experience is somewhat different.



This is much more like a stout than a porter to me. It's thinner and less creamy than a porter should be in my book, and there is a distinct bitter finish that lets the beer down.



Simple, dark brown/black pour with nothing else to report. Some head, but no lacing. The smell is low key, with very little clout and the tastes are mainly bitter with some hops. Very stout like, weak mouthfeel.



Needs some time I guess, but for now, disappointing.

The pour is a butterscotch orange that is very murky. The bottle conditioning doesn't really help the appearance, and some very clumpy yeast came out of the bottle at the last minute and disappointingly settled in the head. The head itself was fantastic, tall, billowing and rocky. Really pillow like!



The usual characteristics are present in the intial tastes and the aroma - that is, a big grapefruit! However, this beer was different to most of the others of this style I have tried. The grapefruit had been tempered with spoonfuls of sugar. A real strong, sweet malt backbone helps support the hops and the ABV in a way that I have found to be rather uncommon amongst American micro brewed IPA's. A real treat. It's a balanced beer and a subtle Double IPA (if that's really possible).



Some warming alcohol comes through at the end too, all in all a real treat. Lovely, get some soon!

Taco Mac, Marietta, GA, $4.25.
Very nice. Beautiful, deep, dark brown, almost black, with a lovely dark tan head.
Very, very smooth drinking with just the right amount of carbonation. The bartender seemed to think there was a lot of gingerbread in the beer, but I didn't pick that up. I got a smoky, sweet vanilla, with of course, all the mixed spices associated with a quality seasonal brew.
Went down really, well, with a deicious sweet finish, some light coating on the tongue. Reminded me a lot of the local Sweetwater Festive Ale brew in the same mould.
Highly recommend a couple of these if you get the chance."

Unusual this, and fairly average to boot. Pours like an unfiltered, bottle fermented wheat, tasted like a sour lager, calls itself a Pale Ale, what gives??



I usually like the yeast sediment to be added to my glass with the beer, but on this ocassion I wish I hadn't. Rather than getting an attractive, classic cloudy look, I got a nasty, murky pond water effect. Didn't look good at all.



The smell was lemony, almost to the point of seeming artificial and the initial tastes were very sour. This evened out a little half way down the beer, but the damage was done. Some very strong mixed flavors that I didn't care for, including more citrus and then a mild, bitter, hop finish.



A very odd collection of flavors and senses. Probably won't bother again anytime soon."
Tröegs Brewing Company,Tröegs Mad Elf,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,11.00%,bottle,3.55,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,12/18/2004,"I'm not at all sure that I would classify this as a Belgian Strong Dark, in as much as its characteristics seem much more like an Old Ale or an American Barleywine.
As expected, very little carbonation on the pour and a quick to form (and to disappear) head. It's very sweet, with lots of honey, but not much of the advertised cherries.
The alcohol content means it's pretty warming on the way down. Full in the mouth without being overpowering, this is a beer that needs to be treated with respect and then you'll enjoy it more.
Very smooth, with only a little bit of that slick oily feeling of such high ABV's at the very end.
Thanks to meathookjones for this sample."
"Bell's Brewery, Inc.",Bell's Expedition Stout,,,Russian Imperial Stout,10.50%,bottle,3.85,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,12/17/2004,"Inky blackness characterizes this stout and it comes with that classic coffee colored head.



It's very ""coffeeish"" with the usual coating in the mouth and sweetness associated with a stout of this quality. I had absolutely NO idea that the ABV was as high as reported here. It disguises that magnificently. There was no hint to me that this was anything other than just a strong beer, I would never have guessed the 11.5%.



Tasty, sweet and a nice stout. Stouts are not my favorite style, but this one came through with all I expected and had heard about. Nice one. Thanks to meathookjones."
Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,Au Courant,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,7.00%,bottle,3.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,12/17/2004,"A lot of sweetness is the abiding memory imparted by this brew.



Pours a lovely, attractive golden color with a decent head, but one that disappears very quickly. The slickness in the mouthfeel is not unpleasant but really is true to form for beer that has a much higher ABV. This has the mouthfeel of a Barleywine, but lacks the kick. In some respects that's not at all bad, since you get the sweetness and the feel without the ""kick in the ass"" alcohol.



Currants? Au Courant? I have no idea about that or its relevance, but it tastes good to me.



I'd like to try more of this to see how it really sits in a longer session, but for now I enjoyed it, even if it fell between two stools for me.



Thanks meathookjones."
Heavyweight Brewing Co.,Perkuno's Hammer Imperial Porter,,,Baltic Porter,8.00%,bottle,4.3,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,12/17/2004,"Lovely.



Solid Porter with alcohol, smoothness and associated drinkability to back up its impressive resume.



I love a good Porter and this is another one. Still can't top my personal St. Peter's favorite, but a great experience nevertheless.



The usual opaque, black pour with some deep crimson highlights (perhaps that was just the lighting rather than the beer, but it looked good nonetheless).



Plenty of creaminess (a trait I look for in a Porter) and smoothness in the brew that makes it highly drinkable.



Solid finish with lots of body and an aftertaste that leaves you wanting more. Thanks to meathookjones for this one."
Brewery Ommegang,Rare Vos (Amber Ale),,,Belgian Dark Ale,6.50%,bottle,3.55,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,12/16/2004,"First time I'd seen this offered as a single 750 mL bottle in GA. Before it was usually only hanging around in the Ommegang, triple sampler packs with Three Philosophers and Hennepin.



By no means Ommegang's best offering, in fact I was a little disappointed. That may be because they have set such a high standard with Hennepin, Three Philospohers and Ommegang



The pour is a much more orange/red color than I was expecting with a huge head and lacing too. The overwhelming experience in the taste is one of a slightly sour, spicy yeast taste. Not bad, certainly a authentic Belgian feel, but it lacks the depth, complexity, taste and the general quality of the brewery's other beers.



Apple/acidic nose and flavors are present too.



On the up side, like all Ommegang beers, this is very, very good value. The second time I drank this it was part of the mixed 3-pack with 750's of Hennepin, and three Philosophers AND had an Ommegang glass included for $14.99.



Would not be at the top of my list of, ""must get agains"" but not bad, and an intersting beer to try."
Heavyweight Brewing Co.,Old Salty Barleywine 2004,,,English Barleywine,?,bottle,4.03,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,12/14/2004,"Pours with little or no carbonation to give a brown sugar colored beer with some minor lacing around the edges of the head.



The aroma is all sweetness and sugar and so are the initial tastes. A very, very sweet combination of flavors hit, and the Golden Syrup that is mentioned on the label is very evident all the way through. When I drank this I was craving something sweet and I was not disappointed. This was a massively sugared brew, but not so much as to make it unpleasant nor undrinkable.



The mouthfeel was excellent too, with a distinct lack of that sugar, syrupy feel that can come with the style. 



Alcohol is obviously there, and it threatens, but is nicely subdued to keep you going back for more.



This certainly won't be to everyone's liking, but I enjoyed it immensley.



Nice artwork and presentation too."
Victory Brewing Company,Hop Wallop,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,8.50%,bottle,3.03,4.5,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,12/13/2004,"This is certainly a popular brew amongst BA's, but if you're not a huge hop-head (as I'm not) this is obviously not going to be your cup of tea. Having said that I am glad that I tried it (thanks meathookjones) and I am trying to review based upon the style not my own tastes.
A very attractive pour with an orange, crystal clear body and a decent head. The aroma is all bitter citrus grapefruit and this is replicated in the taste. Unfortunately, the hops with the relatively high ABV is all I get. I don't mind hops, but this is another brew that seems unbalanced to me. The hops give a mildly soapy taste to me.
It leaves a very dry, clawing feel behind in the mouth which is not really very nice at all."
Brouwerij Westmalle (Adbij der Trappisten van Westmalle),Westmalle Trappist Tripel,,,Tripel,9.50%,bottle,4.38,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,12/11/2004,"I was extremely surprised by this beer, not by the quality or the general excellence- that reputation had gone before it - but by the drinkability and the creaminess. I wasn't expecting such a drinkable beer considering the style and the ABV.



Some spice in the aroma and initial tastes that fades quickly to give way to a class ale. Lots of creaminess and retention in the head with significant lacing in the Westmalle chalice (thanks to meathookjones for the glass AND the beer).



There's a complexity to the flavors here that is not overwhelming, unlike for example, I find Orval to have. I found that I had time to distinguish each different part of the beer before the next became apparent.



Unusually excellent mouthfeel and a crisp, dry finish completes the picture against the back drop of cream."
Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),Samuel Adams Winter Lager,,,Bock,5.50%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,12/10/2004,"Very servicable brew.



Clear, dark copper with big fluffy head.



I found this really quite satisfying, both from a body point of view and the decent ABV. Very malty and bready all the way through with a nice smooth ending.



Lacks any spice for the style, but still is a nice package. 



Refreshing too which is an unusual characteristic for the style."
Fuller Smith & Turner PLC,Fuller's 1845,,,English Strong Ale,6.30%,bottle,4.85,5,5,5,4.5,4.5,12/5/2004,"Beers as good as 1845 remain few and far between. I think of this as a classic English bitter. It's a dark beer, with loads and loads of taste and complexity, but above all else it has SUBTLETY! Beers like this aren't brewed much in the USA, where the liking is still for beers of this nature to be either enormously hopped or have massive ABV's.



The aroma starts the experience. It reminds me of Celebrator Dopplebock, with layer after layer of fruity alcohol. The first tastes are all encomposing because they give you everything! You get the warm alcohol, the deep rich malt, a little bitterness, then the refreshing blast - it's all there.



The look is stunning, ruby red highlights agaianst a mahogany backdrop with the perfect head. The head lingers - it looks like you are drinking real beer! For me, although this is not necessarily perfect, it's a beer that I consider to represent everything a beer should be. Deep and satisfying. Enjoy."

Some sweetness in the aroma, a hint of chocolate too, but very subdued.



Light on taste and quite thin in the mouth, this was not as chewy as I was expecting. I expect a little more body in my brown ales, but the upside was that I found it really quite refreshing.



Not bad at all, nothing to write home about, but I'd certainly drink it again."
Palmetto Brewing Company,Palmetto Lager,,,American Pale Lager,?,bottle,4,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,12/4/2004,"Smashing beer. This is a simple, no nonsense refreshing lager that I really, really enjoyed.



Good looking pour with a thick frothy head that had excellent retention. Exceptionally clear, golden coloration and a crispness that really caught my attention. Very smooth, no bitterness or dryness on the way down, just a solid American lager. Great summer refresher.



Good value too, definitely worth picking up a six pack when in the Carolina's."
Palmetto Brewing Company,Palmetto Amber,,,American Amber / Red Ale,?,bottle,3.03,3.5,3,3,3,3,12/3/2004,"Malt appearance in terms of color, and that comes through in the aroma and the initial taste. This soon changes to a dry sensation, but without much hop bitterness. This beer has a very light feel about it, that could be taken either way - either as a positve or a negative depending on my mood.



If you're looking for a stand out beer, forget it, if you are looking for a fairly light, easy drinking, local alternative when you are in the South Carolina area then by all means give it a try. If you do, I doubt that you'll have much more to say about it, other than it's a moderately drinkable, moderate brew!"

Standard brown, caramel colored pour with a disappointing head and lace.



A rather ordinary brown ale with nowhere near enough body for my liking. Quite dry and thin which may be a function of the American version. I like a darker, maltier, less dry version of the brown ale than this. Aroma is not especially noticeable, nor is much else about the beer. Mild vinegar acidity in the palate too.



Brooklyn packaging leaves you in no doubt that this beer is part of that family - I like their uniformity of style of labels."

This is listed at 13.25% ABV, bigger than previous vintages so I am a bit confused as to why this is not listed as a different beer in the database (surely the recipe must have changed). Anyway, just like all the other vintages this is pure marzipan, with a delicious coke like appearance and sweet, smooth and warming. Fairly obviously, the alcohol is still way too hot and in a couple of years this will be spectacular. For now, lay it down



2003 Vintage, Jax, Sandy Springs, Atlanta, GA, USA.



Wow! I was ready to be disappointed by this because on the whole, I find brews with this much alcohol have a very hard time pulling off the balance flavors. This was excpetional.



Nothing spectacular to look at (the standard flat appearance for a 11-12% ABV brew) so the first thing that hits you is the aroma. To me it's ALL marzipan. Delicious. The whole experience is warming, smooth as silk and everything seems in perfect balance. Unusual for such a high ABV in my experience.



This was exceptional to me because I don't usually enjoy these very high alcohol beers, but this one worked where so many others have failed.

T & R Theakston Ltd.,Theakston Old Peculier,,,Old Ale,5.70%,bottle,3.85,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,11/24/2004,"Still solid after all these years, but the bottled version that I drank in 2004 in the USA didn't resemble what I remember drinking on tap several years ago in England. These are obviously slightly different products, but the gap between them seems wider than ever. Ho hum.



Dark, mahogonany pour with a nice head. There is plenty of lacing and some stickiness too. Quite rich in aroma of sweet chocolate and very smooth on the way down, until the finish which is surprisingly bitter. A nice ending. Some caramel and toffee in there too.



Still a good pint, but not quite what I remember from years gone by and I am not sure that the Old Ale moniker is really that true to what is in the bottle."

Very pale color, even for an IPA. The pour leaves a small head with little or no lacing. Very pale orange color and lots of clarity.



Aroma has more sweetness and malt than expected, and not much hop character.



This is an especially dry IPA on my palate, with a very clean feel about it. Characteristic citrus hops and nose, with grapefruit being dominant. The finish is also dry and little ""chemically"" which was not to my liking.



7.00% ABV is very well hidden.



Brooklyn packing is nice and simple."

The first thing that hit me was a smokiness in the aroma. This is one of the few nitro-taps that I feel maintained some of the dark bitterness that the original brew should have, and still managed to combine it with the inherent smooth, silkiness of the nitro presentation. Unlike many others, it still felt as though it had some authenticity to a non-nitro alternative.

Much darker with more obvious alcohol than your average Pale Belgian. I prefer the golden yellow Duvel color as opposed to the darker, maltier looking pales. Indeed, this is much more like a Belgian Brune to me.
Strong malt, yeast, dark fruit flavors upfront in both the aroma and the taste. There is a distinct alcohol feeling to this that is not well disguised and is quite strong. A noticeable spirit like presence.
Very frothy, carbonated head that hangs around, with a strong alcohol flavor all the way through to the end.
This was just not subtle enough for me, a bit too obvious is what I am trying to say. Not bad, but there are many better."

Brooklyn Brewery,Brooklyn Pilsner,,,German Pilsener,5.10%,bottle,4.03,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,11/19/2004,"Very nice beer for two main reasons;



Firstly I found it very refreshing. A little edge of bitterness and malt, but the right amount of smoothness to take the edge off a thirst.



Secondly it looks great. I think this starts with the bottle! I like the simplicity of the Brooklyn packaging and the predominately yellow label catches the eye. When the beer is poured, the head is solid and not too overwhelming, but hangs around long enough to make it better than average.



With Pilsners and the like I'm always looking for a lack of any skunky aroma as a sign of quality and that's what I get here. An initial bitterness that smooths out over time and a solid malt backbone complete the experience. This is something I could happily drink a very large quantity of, either in one sitting or over several sessions. Good job."

The classic dark pour, with a murky body and rather too frothy a head. The head was a little annoying when pouring, and the look - is as often the case with these type of beers - not very special. However, one whiff and then the first taste, soon makes up for the aesthetic disappointment. Chock-full of all the classic sweet, dark fruit flavors with the added addition of of some mixed spice and some fruit peel.



A warmth comes over you, both in the mouthfeel and on the way down. A nice sipper, enjoy in moderation for full effect."

The attraction of drinking this is largely lost on me. Under any circumstances, or in the name of any style, ABV of 11.3% coupled with 120 IBU's is getting close to a point that is perilously close to simply going too far. I understand the style, I understand the art of producing massive beers and I understand the role of these types of brew in the grand scheme of beer making and in the grand scheme of an evening's drinking, but even to a fairly well experienced palate this isn't much fun.



This is an unattractive, unbalanced drink that I can't derive any pleasure from. In that light there sees little or no point in drinking it. In my experience, fairly typical of Rogue, in as much as the beer is simply massive for the sake of being massive.

I love this ""Brune"" Belgian style as it reeks of ""real"" beer. Tasty, with a subtlety that belies its relatively high alcohol content, it truly warms the cockles of the heart. I find that the alcohol in this brew takes on a real, depth, like a complex after dinner liqueur it has the ability to satisfy from all angles - aroma, taste, complexity, warmth, drinkability and more.



It pours big, with a rocky, dense head and great lacing.



Lots of caramel sugars up front, but these are tempered by the seriousness of the beer. It is sweet, but not in a ""girly"" way. This is a beer to be enjoyed slowly and in small quantities. Not because it is not drinkable in large volumes, just because it is better if one savors the moment.



Yep, let's have some more. Ta."
Genesee Brewing Co.,Dundee Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),5.30%,bottle,3.88,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,11/15/2004,"Well, well, well - what a nice experience and a pleasant surprise.



I was expecting little, but enjoyed this one very much. I was expecting a poor quality, nasty macro type, but got a pretty sophisticated brew, againast all expectations.



A nice amber pour with a decent head and some lacing.



The overall experience here is a mildly hoppy, clean and overwhelmingly dry experience. Very clean with no nasty stuff. This is NOT a great Pale Ale, but it is a very servicible day to day beer. Dry was definitely the major characteristic that had the effect of making this a very drinkable and ""moreish"" beer.



Nice transparent label too."

Yeh! Smashing example of the Belgian Pale, a real quality product.



Pours with that classic pale, cloudy yellow that falls somewhere between Hoeagaarden and Duvel. A head that is large, frothy and then rocky, that seems at first to be too much and a little annoying, but settles to be a solid performer.



The beer exudes class and is has the main characteristics of being dry, but hoppy, with some clove edginess coming through too. The beer itself, like the head, was a little gassy, but evened out with a little room temperature.



Lovely example of the style, a super drink."
Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,St. Bernardus Prior 8,,,Dubbel,8.00%,bottle,3.93,3.5,4,4,4.5,3.5,11/8/2004,"Again, typically, not especially attractive brown, cloudy pour, but a lovely head and the promise of taste and quality from the lacing.



This beer certainly has a bread aroma, but I get lots of creamy raisins too. It's complicated and complex, but I also get an awful lot of alcohol which is not particularly well masked. It's not unpleasant, but it is quite strong - a whiskey warming type of alcohol that reached down low in the stomach and warms the throat.



It's full of taste, with some serious mouthfeel, but a little too much in places. I enjoyed it, but I'm not going to be consuming a lot of this in one session. Nevertheless, another nice beer from this stable."
SweetWater Brewing Company,Sweetwater Blue,,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,4.90%,bottle,3.43,4,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,11/8/2004,"For the life of me I can't really work out why a small brewery would attempt to brew a non-mainstream beer like this.



It pours with a standard smallish head that disappears quickly, and has a distinct pale green/yellow appearance. Although this sounds somewhat unattractive it really does look pretty good.



There is a very noticable blueberry aroma and taste, but both seem extremely articificial. I would like the appearance of some real deep dark, blueish colors in the beer that the addition of fresh blueberries leads one to expect. When that doesn't materialize one gets somewhat suspicious.



It's drinkable, but it is tart, quite sour in fact and not especially smooth. The fruit lends the beer a dry taste that isn't bad, but I left this one feeling quite dissatisfied. Just got the feeling it could be so much more. Too thin in the mouth, a chance missed."

As time goes by I really have no idea how one is supposed to distinguish between these North American, macro, adjunct lagers. If it were a blind tasting I doubt, even as an experienced drinker, that I would tell between all of these mass produced products.



OK, large head and clear yellow pour from a 24 oz can. Very corny aroma, but a fairly clean taste despite the obvious mild skunk. It's drinkable (just), but like all the others, thin in the mouth and largely forgetable. Why bother???"
Brouwerij Lindemans,Lindemans Pêche,,,Lambic - Fruit,4.00%,bottle,3.18,3,3.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,11/6/2004,"A pale orange/pink pour with a head that disappears pretty quickly. Unlike the Cassis, this looks like beer with the pale orange look of a lager.



The aroma and initial tastes are very fruity, but in a wine cooler type way. Very sweet initially that drops off. Even thouggh there is a distinct fruit flavor, it's not especially ""peachy"". It reminds my of cheap champagne or a desert wine with some apples thrown in.



This is a very light drink, good for non-serious summer consumption, but not really my cup of tea. The Cassis is much more tart and has a much much more ""beery"" taste and finish. I won't be rushing back to this one."
Pabst Brewing Company,Colt 45 Malt Liquor,,,American Malt Liquor,5.61%,bottle,3,3,2.5,3,3,3.5,11/6/2004,"The 22 oz ""Double Duece"" bottle, purchased where else, but a Gas Station!?



This beer is almost certainly not as unpleasant as most people think, and I was quite content with my sampling.



First, we know what we're getting, a cheap 6.1% ABV brew that is not supposed to be an adventure into the beer hall of fame. If you take it for what it is, you probably won't be disappointed.



What I look for in cheap beer is a refeshing experience, a lack of skunk and a smoothness that makes it drinkable. A nice ABV buzz helps too, and Colt 45 just about satisfies all of these criteria.



A steady beer to fall back on, with a great American tradition."
Steel Brewing Company,Steel Reserve 211 (High Gravity),,,American Malt Liquor,8.10%,can,2.85,3,3,3,2.5,2.5,11/4/2004,"Typical high gravity malt liquor in some ways, but suprisingly smooth in others.
I was expecting to open this can and be confronted with the syrupy, alcohol sweet slickness that usually accompanies this kind of brew. I was pleasantly surprised. Sure there were some of those characteristics present, but nothing like the close to ""undrinkableness"" of stuff like Tennent's Super and other such chemicals.
The taste reminded me very much a commericially produced, high alcohol cider - very sweet and lots of alcohol. Not too thick in the mouth and in a strange way, quite drinkable."
Brooklyn Brewery,Post Road Pumpkin Ale,,,Pumpkin Ale,5.00%,bottle,3.73,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,11/2/2004,"INITIAL REVIEW FALL 2004: Well, I guess it's lost a bit on me - the whole pumpkin ale thing. 



I get a beer that is a clear orange color, quite attractive with a little head but next to no retention or lacing, followed by a drink that has definite pumpkin overtones, but a nasty, peppery, prickly spiciness at the end. I don't much care for it.



The aroma is not very nice at all, with a sickly (vomit like) touch.



EDIT: Fall 2005, drinking a year old '04 Post Road Pumpkin.



The aromas have intensified for the better. Much more spicy pumpkin flavors are now present and a extra depth of flavor. This has aged very nicely over the last 12 months. Much better lacing, smoother and more mature, with extra malt body - in fact much, much better than a year ago. (Numbers adjusted for the aged beer).



Final bottle of '04 drunk in late Feb '06 (close to 18 months old) and still holding up very nicely thank you."

Lovely orange pour with a sensible head and some lacing.



This beer is everything beers like SN Celebration and Rogue can never be, but would be better off trying to emulate.



It's a hoppy and dry bitter, where subtlety is key. You don't get knocked over with a huge whiff of hops in the nose, nor do you get a flavor like you're chewing on actual hops. What you get is a wonderfully crafted beer that is so much more difficult to make than a massive hop explosion.



Refreshing in the extreme, this beer shows why less is more. Take note some US micro brewers. Great stuff from Adnams, funny thing is, this isn't quite as good as their ""Broadside"", either."
Amstel Brouwerij B. V.,Amstel Light,,,Light Lager,3.50%,bottle,1.35,3,1.5,1,1.5,1.5,10/31/2004,"No matter what type of BA you are; a hop head, malt lover, stout or lager lover, etc. once you have established the fact that you like beer that tastes like ""something"", then it's hardly surprising that when you taste a beer that tastes like ""nothing"" it becomes pretty much good for nothing except drain pour.



My problem with this stuff (and others like it) is that apart form the appearance, it has no relation to beer whatsoever. It's tasteless, thin in the mouth and comes with zero character.



The pour does look like a quality pilsner or its equivalent, but the lacklustre frothy head gives it away. The smell is of stale beer, the taste? What taste? The one redeeming feature is that if it were ice-cold, one bottle could act as a thirst quencher - much like water, that in the case of Amstel Light, I think I would prefer."

As usual, large grapefruit notes and not a great deal else.
2006 Vintage. Only paid $6.99 this year at Green's.
Still grapefruit and soap based, and although I have grown to enjoy this more each year, it still strikes me as a beer that is out of balance. 
2004 Vintage. $8.99 Six Pack, Arbor Beverage Depot, Douglasville, GA, USA.
Well, you BA's certainly got me worked up for this one. I was anticipating something extraordinary and ended up being disappointed. Another SN brew, that is solid and don't really dislike, but another that fails to meet the expectations that everyone seems to build it up to.
Nice color to the pour, a solid mahogany look, but a very lively head. Nothing wrong with that, but within seconds it's gone to give a disappointing, cold macro, Killians type dark beer no-head. Some lacing.
Aroma is mild citrus hops, but the initial taste is way too grapefruit for me. It's really quite a nasty, acidic grapefruit too. It left a very metallic, copper like coating in my mouth. Not very nice at all.
It seems to lose some of the acidic edge after it's been sitting for about 20-30 minutes, but by then the damage is done.
The hops are out of proportion for me, a bit like I find is the case with Rogue's too. I don't dislike hops, I just find the balance way too often out of line with the beer. Looking forward to laying some down and drinking way in the future to see if it improves."

Another beer that falls into the, ""When I want cheap domestic, I'd definitely pick this up instead of macro adjunct lager swill, but other than that it's very average and poor compared to literally thousands of real quality micro's and many macro's"", category.
Aroma and taste are very muted with weak maltiness being the order of the day. A nice looking pour with a decent head that does hang around and produce some, if not much, lacing. 
The malt and the hops are both low key, which has the effect of making this drinkable but singularly uninspiring. Mouhfeel - like the rest - not bad."
Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),Samuel Smith's Pure Brewed Lager Beer,,,Euro Pale Lager,5.00%,bottle,2.88,4,2.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,10/23/2004,"What's this all about then? I have to laugh at the style that BA lists this as, ""Euro Pale Lager"". Of course, Americans are still under the impression that England is part of Europe in a way that reaches beyond geography, when *we* all know that anything that comes out of Yorkshire is likely to be as un-Eurpoean as a trip to Walmart in Villa Rica,GA. Anyway, back to the beer.



Crystal clear yellow, with a very large attractive head. Extremely smooth (which is good) without a hint of skunk or for that matter much aroma or taste at all. This beer looks great, and is very smooth going down, with no offensive alcohol, skunk, bitterness or nasty lager chemical taste, but it is so smooth it seems to lack personality or character. I think Smith's would be better off leaving this style to the real Europeans, I see no reason why they should attempt this."

I don't seem to see the Sam Adams Pale Ale around very much and perhaps that is a distribution issue or the fact that it seems to me to be a very mediocre brew.



Everything about this beer screams OK, but nothing more. Decent appearance, slightly orange with some head and lacing. The aromas and the tastes are all very mild. A very weak malt backbone with some dryish, very mildly bitter hops, it's all too uninspiring for me. 



The beer is certainly drinkable, but fails to make any kind of significant impression or impact, which is a shame given that this is a simple style that Sam Adams ought to be doing better at. An opportunity missed since this could be a cross-over micro/macro that could act as a BA to the uneducated masses. Right now it's missing the boat."

What a super beer.



Pour is dark brown and cloudy, with quite a lot of carbonation, but the head is thick, full of body and adds to the presentation and appearance. Like the quality product that this is, the head hangs around for a good portion of the drink.



I don't detect the specific orange and aniseed aromas that others do, but there is no doubt that the beer is spicy and somewhat herbal. Don't let that description put you off, it is really pleasant and promises much.



The beer is really satisfying, smooth, filling and totally disguises the 8+% ABV. I could drink alot of this very quickly indeed. The mouthfeel is full, as it should be, and it does a job in a way that so many beers just fail to do.



Full bodied, different, satisfying, tasty it attacks the senses and is excellent value for money. Real beer!"
Genesee Brewing Co.,Dundee Original Honey Brown Lager,,,American Amber / Red Lager,4.50%,bottle,3.35,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,10/17/2004,"Typically macro in a number of ways; head retention (zero), fizzy carbonation, light mouthfeel and body, Looks better than average with a nice amber color.



The honey taste in is evidence upfront, although I would not necessarily be able to discern it as honey were it not on the label. It is definitely sweet though. Not a sickly sweet that makes it difficult to drink, but a kind of smooth sweet that aids the drinkability. Difficult to know if the malts are adding to the sweetness or if its the sugar/honey.



A little bit of a novelty, more drinkable that many macro's, but not one that deserves any recommendation other than slightly better than average."
Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),Samuel Adams Octoberfest,,,Märzen / Oktoberfest,5.30%,bottle,4.13,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,10/16/2004,"Updated Review 10/10:
Six years on since my original review, I still really love this beer. Today I paid $8.23 for a sixer, so this is still fantastic value.
Color in 2010 seems even richer than ever and the malt depth is always impressive to me. Great aftertaste of mellow caramel sweetness is just so satisfying and pleasing to me.
Highly drinkable, great value truly one of my favorite beers in the USA.
Original Review 10/04:
Really pretty good for around $7 a sixer.
This is a very attractive beer indeed. A really crystal clear orange/amber hue and an attractive (if somewhat short-lived) head result from the pour. Some very extensive lacing.
Whether this beer is particularly true to the style is debatable, with a very sweet malt start that lingers and overpowers any significant bitterness. Rounded malts with a pleasing aftertaste. Satisfying. Clean finish."
Flying Dog Brewery,Tire Bite Golden Ale,,,Kölsch,5.10%,bottle,3,3,3,3,3,3,10/9/2004,"This really was disappointing. The reason I say that is that my other Flying Dog experiences have been generally very positive.



The pour is a really pale yellow color with a non-existent head, a very ordinary looking beer. Taste was a little tart with plenty of alcohol flavor up front that faded to make it drinkable, but singularly unspectatcular.



Super-average in the mouth with very little character or excitement. It's a shame, becasue Flying Dog often do much better than this.



I hate to say it, but this really reminded me of an average macro lager."
Flying Dog Brewery,Old Scratch Amber Lager,,,American Amber / Red Lager,5.50%,bottle,3.88,3.5,3.5,4,3,4.5,10/6/2004,"Guess what? This Amber lager is...well....amber in color. The appearance is average with some head and lacing, but only after a quite aggressive pour.



This stuff is very drinkable, with the only slight let down being a average mouthfeel - a little too thin for my liking.



It is a very sweet beer on my palate. There is not a huge amount of maltiness either, which keeps the sweetness in check. I guess that it is also some hops coming through that helps check the sweetness, but I didn't feel the hop quality was either large or pronounced.



Definitely thirst quenching and drinkable, a very light version of the style. Not bad at all."
Flying Dog Brewery,Road Dog Porter,,,American Porter,6.00%,bottle,3.53,3,3.5,3.5,3,4,10/6/2004,"Well, it's OK, I quite like it, but it's not a very good Porter. If you really want to investigate Porters this isn't where you want to be. I note that BA has this as a Scottish Ale so perhaps I'm getting the wrong end of the stick anyway, but whatever, the name is misleading to say the least.



Alcoholic aroma with a light brown body, too light for my liking if this really is a Porter?



A good color, but a weak head and way too thin. A taste that is on the creamy side, but again way too weak for my liking. A disappointment if you are looking for a Porter, but nevertheless still a beer that is OK."
Paulaner Brauerei GmbH & Co. KG,Salvator Doppel Bock,,,Doppelbock,7.90%,bottle,3.95,4,4,4,4.5,3.5,10/6/2004,"As is usual with the decent Doppelbocks, this is a complex beer with a lot of richness, fruit, sweetness, smokiness and caramel tastes and aromas. So often I find these beers rich and deep in layered tastes, in fact, often they can really be a little too complicated for my palate that often prefers a simplier beer.



A really dark pour with a nice head and some lacing. Initial tastes are chock full of fruitcake raisins and mixed peel, that are then tempered by the alcohol, that for me, has a warming quality like a good rum.



I like to savor this style and sip one or two in an evening rather than drink larger quantities, I think one appreciates the depth of these beers in smaller amounts."

Another beer that suffers from a hopelessly over chilled, too cold presentation. When this stuff comes out of the ice box freezer and get poured into a frozen glass it's just about impossible to taste or smell anything. I bet this stuff tastes ten times better after about 30 minutes of defrosting.



I get lots of corn, a little malt and some alcohol in the initial aroma and taste. It didn't go down too well at all, with a sharpish carbonation. Put it with the cold temperature, it's adjunct feel and the alcohol sting and you've got an average beer at best, actually something quite poor.



I'll try this again at a different temperature."

In fact it looked distinctly flat almost right out of the bottle. Outside of the lack of head, it looks good.
There is a real biscuit malt taste and a very distinct creaminess to this beer. The malt is in the aroma too, but in a subdued way. A lovely smooth beer to drink, with an obvious malt character, but well balanced.
Mouthfeel was better than average but not large, but it did leave a pleasant moreish feel after the first bottle which is always a good sign.

Light colored IPA with a nice looking, frothy head and some lacing.



As expected for the IPA style, the citric hops are up front in both the aroma and the taste, and there is a surprisingly clean bitterness to this beer. Smooth and decent size mouthfeel add to the authenticity of the brew - it tastes and feels like REAL beer! The 7.00% ABV gives it a little kick too, which makes the whole experience even more enjoyable.



The aftertaste is long, clean and bitter and lingers sufficiently to leave you wanting more. In my opinion, truer to the IPA style that I understand than many other similar Americans, this despite its light look.



Well worth trying and good value too."
Löwenbräu AG,Löwenbräu Original,,,Munich Helles Lager,5.20%,on-tap,3,3,3,3,3,3,9/26/2004,"Largely forgettable lager and if it weren't for the extra alcohol taste that this one gives I would have forgotten it instantly. Why is it that so many lagers that are presented on tap often turn out to be completely lifeless in the glass after about twenty seconds?



Non-descript usual, macro lager look, with some fierce initial carbonation. Taste largely reminiscent of a standard, adjunct lager, but slightly improved as the alcohol taste/experience kicks in. On-tap this lager always hits above its 5.2% ABV weight.



Poor head and no lacing complete the very disappointing experience. Sorry, just don't like it much!"
Widmer Brothers Brewing Company,Widmer Hefeweizen,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,4.90%,on-tap,3.05,5,3,3,2.5,3,9/26/2004,"The most significant part of this beer is its appearance. Truly thick cloudiness lasts the whole way down the pint. When I first saw it in the glass I thought the barman had poured me a toffee and butterscotch milkshake - a truly unique looking beer! I gave it a 5 for appearance simply because it WAS exceptional - not necessarily good looking, but definitely exceptional!



I'm assuming the yeast and wheat in this beer combine to give the amazing appearance and I was anticipating a wickedly flavorful experience like no other Hefe I had ever tried. In that light the beers appearance overhyped itself, and the mouthfeel, flavor and overall feel was much to thin for me.

Usual corked & caged presentation in the 750 mL bottle.
Time to re-visit this old friend. Pour is as impressive as ever wih a high, rocky tan colored head and great retention and lace. Brownish, garnet body with perfect carbonation. Smooooth!
Drinkability rmeains huge for me and the alcohol seems much easier to handle than the last time I reviewed this. Everytime I drink this I really don't get the cherry notes SPECIFICALLY, but I do love the Belgian dark fruit experience that this provides - delicious. So satisfying.

The lasting impression of this beer is one of a rich, mature, fufilling experience. Although it would be possible to drink a large quantity of this stuff, it is much better enjoyed as a ""sipper"" in smaller quantities.

This beer is way too lightweight all around. Color is suspisciously golden (macro lager) rather than a darker, bitter color, aroma and taste are way too short and undemanding and the taste is promising for a few seconds and then disappears to absolutely nothing. There are some hops up front and some malt in the background, but as it passes the lips, by the time it gets to the throat, I've forgotten about it.

Drank it at the brewery on one of their Friday night tastings. There is no doubt that the flavors and aromas in this beer are more subtle than many others of a similar style, and that it was thinner than many Hefe's, but those characteristics added to its drinkability on a hot day.



A golden yellow, hazy pour with a substantial head that didn't hang around too long. The fruit and spice notes are difficult to pick up in the aroma, but I am notoriusly bad at smelling them anyway. The beer went down really well, with a nice full mouthfeel and a roundness that was quite satisfying. Enjoyable."

Pours dark brown with quite a lot of carbonation. A little too much in the bottle that I tried. It's a good looking beer that appears to have some substantial body.
Very rich aromas and tastes initially hit you. It's all malt! Really quite sweet, in keeping with the style. A good mouthfeel (not as large as it looks) and a very smooth finish.

Thanks to BA, AKSmokedPorter for the info.



As AKSmokedPorter says; ""They've proven they can brew a beer like this, why not do it regularly for the general public????""



With reference to the Tomahawk Amber Ale;



It pours a decent dark brown color with a nice, compact head (nitro-type) that lasted. A nice drink with a sweet malt start and finish with plenty of caramel tastes and a decent hoppy backbone. Good mouthfeel, not a bad beer at all. Put it in the context of a baseball game and you have a (relatively) tasty macro offering. Quite drinkable if you can swallow the utterly ridiculous $7.00 price tag!

Poured a dirty orange color - quite attractive - with a nice head and pleasant orange aroma. Not too overpowering. A very refreshing beer with the orange flavor coming through but not off-putting, but I felt a little short-changed. The beer just wasn't fruity enough to give that experience in full, and had been doctored enough to take it out of the Hefe style.



Mouthfeel was too watery for real satisfaction and the orange end was sour rather than tart.



I don't know, I really feel this is an excellent, potential combination opportunity slightly missed. Still, I enjoyed the six-pack and though it was pretty refreshing, I feel a great chance to make a real stunner passed by."
Desnoes & Geddes Limited,Red Stripe Jamaican Lager,,,American Adjunct Lager,4.70%,bottle,3.6,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4.5,9/12/2004,"Bottle, $3.75, Buffalo Wings Bar & Grill, Douglasville, GA, USA. 
I probably haven't drunk any Red Stripe for the best part of 10 years, and from what I've read since, and what I remembered from back then, I was expecting very little. In fact, I was expecting to be disappointed. So I was delighted when I experienced a refreshing and clean lager that was very drinkable with none of the nasty aftertastes and junk associated with so many macro adjuncts.
The pour was a golden yellow with a small but decent head that lingered. Some lacing too. A fairly sweet, but nicely balanced experience that was above all else, clean. So often one gets those nasty chemical, acidic aftertastes with over carbonated watery tastes. Not here. Very refreshing, clean, sweet taste. Was it bland? Yes. Was it full of character? No. Did I experience a complex beer? No, but I did enjoy it and would certainly reach for it again as a thirst quencher and everyday, adjunct lager."
Private Weissbierbrauerei G. Schneider & Sohn GmbH,Schneider Aventinus,,,Weizenbock,8.20%,bottle,4.6,4,4.5,5,4.5,4,9/11/2004,"Abiding memories of this drinking experience are the massive carbonation (bad) and the complex, rich flavors (good).
Pours with a massive (and I mean massive) head with extreme carbonation flowing up from the bottom of the glass. The carbonation is so extreme that it actually becomes somewhat annoying and almost gets to the point where I am beginning to wonder if the beer is infected!
Once the carbonation had settled down I was treated to the classic deep banana and spice aromas and taste. The dirty brown appearance even looks as though it could have had a banana liquidized into it! There is obviously a significant alcohol presence which is consumate with the style, BUT to be honest it's not as apparent to me as it can be in some other Weizenbocks. Plenty of clove amongst the turbidity and light sweetness.
I get a lot of creaminess with this beer too. A very, very rich experience in the mouth, which for me made me only want one of these in a session. Given the carbonation I was surprised that the beer did not give a more prickly mouthfeel.
Very complex, rich experience all around and a classic beer in the style, but for me, one that has to be enjoyed in small doses."
Dogwood Brewing Company,Dogwood Bock,,,Bock,?,bottle,2.63,2,2.5,2.5,3,3,9/7/2004,"Didn't really care for this much at all. Organic smell (grass, hay, outdoors type whiff) with some alcohol. A somewhat acidic experience was the overall feeling. Some maltiness too, but a dry, sour, alcohol taste was left behind after drinking.



Poured dirty brown with a somewhat drab appearance and a head that disappeared almost immediately.



Might give this another chance, but for now I'm done."
"Adnams plc, Sole Bay Brewery",Adnams Broadside Strong Original,,,English Strong Ale,6.30%,bottle,4.53,5,4,4.5,4.5,5,9/5/2004,"$2.99 500 mL, Green's Beverage, Ponce de Leon, Atlanta, GA.



Without question one of the best beers that I have tasted in a long time.



Great appearance, with a truly dark red, classic English Bitter look, a hearty, rocky head that has very good retention and lacing.



A fruity, full bodied malty aroma and taste in perfect balance with the bitter finish. Everything is just right! Velvety smooth, large mouthfeel completes the experience. This beer isn't going to please hopheads because it is a subtle, mild mannered bitter, not a ""kick you in the nuts"" type experience - and it's better for that. 



I like to enjoy this as it warms up out of the fridge, say an hour or so after removing it.



Way too little of these more subtle beers are around these days wiith an ever increasing emphasis on huge flavors and hops becoming increasingly the trend.



Adnams does a nice job with the packaging too. This is a beer that is well worth investigating and appreciating. Love it!"
Brouwerij Lindemans,Lindemans Cassis,,,Lambic - Fruit,4.00%,bottle,4.35,5,4.5,4,4,5,9/5/2004,"$7.99 750 mL, Arbor Place Beverage, Douglasville, GA, USA.
About twenty-five years ago when I was taking my first tentative steps as a teenager into alcohol, one of the the most common drinks that we used to experiement with was a ""Lager and Black"". Very simply this would be a pint of macro lager, often something like a Carling Black Label, Carlsberg, Heineken or the like, with a large dash of Blackcurrant cordial (syrup) thrown in the top. This was simply a variation on the much more common ""Lager & Lime"". This produced a violently sweet, purple colored concoction that was easy for a kid to drink. Twenty-five years later as a BA I pick up a Belgian Lambic Cassis and frankly (with a few minor) details don't see much difference!
Obviously the color and aroma are what first hit you with this beer, with a lovely looking pink head on the top of a purple body. The sweet and sour combination make this brew alarmingly drinkable too.
At first I get nothing but the blackcurrant taste, and even after some time this doesn't receed, but it is slightly highlighted with some more bitter notes from the beer as the bottle is emptied. The blackcurrant is really very overpowering and the only difference between this beer and my original Lager & black is that it is smoother and much more carbonated.
I really enjoyed this, but strictly as a novelty a couple of times a year. In some ways, not really a serious beer at all."
Dogwood Brewing Company,Youngblood's Imperial Porter,,,American Porter,?,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,9/4/2004,"Pours absolutely jet black with a dark tan, small head that disappears quickly. Gentle aggitation reproduces the head with some effervesence just like a coke. In fact the whole appearance is *exactly* like a coke!



All the characteristics of a fine Porter, with some extra coffee/chocolate bitterness thrown in at the end for good measure. I prefer a little smoother edge to my Porters, but I think my taste is a little unfaithful to the style and this beer is much closer to where they generally should be.



Got a good coating on the teeth and tongue in the mouthfeel department.



Glad to see innovative stuff from the brewery with the Brewmaster series. Hope to see some other fine examples in the near future."
Spaten-Franziskaner-Bräu,Spaten Münchner Hell (Premium Lager),,,Munich Helles Lager,5.20%,bottle,2.33,3,1.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,9/4/2004,"Frankly this was not good. An amazingly skunky experience that reminded me of a Heineken was the overall impression I was left with.



Weak and lifeless pour with no head and a nasty aroma. Very little else to be said. I got a real corny type whiff with my skunkiness and the whole taste was permeated by the smelliness of the beer.



Very disappointed by a beer I was expecting more of."
Dogwood Brewing Company,Breakdown IPA,,,American IPA,?,bottle,3.6,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,9/3/2004,"Very hoppy notes in the aroma and in the taste upfront, with a serious citrus backbone too. A very cloudy appearance (like iced-tea) with very little head, but some good looking spotty lacing as you go down the glass.



The ending to this beer really is very bitter and I feel a little unbalanced. I don't mind the hops, but the bitterness is really quite sharp and tangy - and not in a pleasant way. Pretty characterful beer and one that I would choose above any macro almost any day, but not too smooth. The bite seems out of proportion with the bark!"
Bières de Chimay (Abbaye Notre Dame de Scourmont),Chimay Première (Red),,,Dubbel,7.00%,bottle,4.05,3,4,4,4,4.5,8/31/2004,"I've been drinking the Chimay range for years, both in the UK and in Belgium and what has always struck me about the Red is the simplistic balance of the beer. In some ways I find this particular beer somewhat ""unBelgian"", but it remains a consistently excellent drink.



Not especially attractive color to the pour, nor does it produce a wonderful looking head, but it's a beer I can rely upon. A simple balance across the board make it a lovely drink to enjoy slowly, especially with food.



The malty sweetness and alcohol are perfect partners.



I prefer the smaller bottles rather than the 750 mL I am reviewing here. I have no idea why that would be, but it seems to be the case."

Quite disappointed.



A watery experience was the overwhelming memory of this beer. All in all way too lightweight for the style. Light ""lager"" colored appearance, decent head but disappeared too quickly with no lacing.



Prickly carbonation in the mouth didn't help either. One redeeming factor - as it warmed up in the glass it improved."
Southampton Publick House,Southampton Saison,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,6.50%,bottle,3.88,4.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,8/29/2004,"My first serious venture into the Saison style.
First impressions are all about the appearance. A golden orange pour with a magnificent head. The head was huge, and beautifully white and rocky - a real treat.
The aroma and initial taste is a cross between cider and champagne. There's a lot of wine like aroma too. A real apple scent is present. The beer starts with a prickly carbonation.
The classic acidity and tartness of the style is evident throughout and until the beer warmed up a little in the glass I found it a bit much. Once an ambient temperature had been reached the whole brew settles down and I enjoyed the second half of the 750 mL much more than the first half.
I suspect that this is an excellent example of the style, but this is a little wasted on me right now - more experience in the style needed! Worth investigating more."

Super value for money with this very nice beer. Beautiful, full-bodied pour with an excellent looking foamy, dense head that is retained well. I get marzipan and caramel in the aroma, with deep ripe, forest fruits in the taste.



Mouthfeel is very nice too. This is a satisfying beer to me and a really enjoyable beer to quaff.



I wouldn't get too caught up with the Belgian moniker, because I think this can be misleading and potentially get people diverted away from how good a beer this is when they start arguing about the authenticity of the name. Drink up and enjoy!



The 750 mL bottle always disappears VERY quickly. Good value, I'm never disappointed with this one."
Redhook Ale Brewery,Long Hammer IPA,,,American IPA,6.50%,on-tap,2.2,3,2,2,2.5,2.5,8/28/2004,"Very strange beer. IPA??



Appearance is 100% North American macro. Golden yellow color, typical no head (but some decent lacing) with absolutely no aroma. I quite literally could not smell a thing! This maybe due to the Arctic temperature it was served at, but I'll never know.



The beer was absolutely tasteless - UNTIL then ending. A very hoppy, bitter and especially dry finish and aftertaste. Before that - nothing! No taste, no smell. Weird!"
Five Seasons Prado,Big Hoppy Monster,,,American Pale Ale (APA),?,on-tap,4.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,8/26/2004,"This was the new, specially brewed 8% brew that Spike was kind enough to give me a preview of before it's appearance in September 2004, not the previously reviewed smaller beer.



This brew reminds me of a typical English bitter, it has the classic red/brown clarity, an upfront hoppy strong character and a solid, well formed and well retained head that is a delight. The only difference was the amazing Grapefruit aroma that was incredibly strong. In fact it was so strong it was on the verge of being slightly off-putting.



Outside of the aroma there is a real ""bite"" to the hops with this beer and it was a delicious change of pace. Not all will enjoy this citrus ""tanginess"", and it is a somewhat acquired taste, but I would encourage visiting this beer - you might like it."
Birra Moretti (Heineken),Moretti La Rossa Birra Doppio Malto,,,Doppelbock,7.20%,bottle,4.38,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,8/22/2004,"Oh yes, it's a malty monster alright, a real nice surprise and one of the most interesting beers I think that I've ever had.



It's a spectacularly good looking beer, with a deep, deep, mahogany red color and a small, but perfectly formed head.



It's one of the best combinations of hop backbone, alcohol and malty sweetness I can recall. This will not appeal to everyone, but it certainly does to me.



Aroma is caramel and the taste follows. The alcoholic finish is magnificent with taste, strength and warmth all included. Wow, good one!"
North Coast Brewing Co.,Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout,,,Russian Imperial Stout,9.00%,bottle,3.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,8/22/2004,"Excellent value and if you can find it on notro you should definitely try it. Nitro definitely adds to the experience here.
A beer that I have grown to enjoy more over the years.
Pours with a jet black appearance and an impressive head that fades quickly. The aroma is ""dark"", meaning it is simply dense with ""bitterness"", chocolate, but over riding the whole thing is quite a strong black coffee. This is replicated in the taste.
It's certainly a beer that is well made, but for my palate and taste a little too dependent on the bitter side of things."
Five Seasons Prado,Lionheart Pale Ale,,,American IPA,?,on-tap,3.98,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,8/20/2004,"A pale golden appearance with a scant head.



Everytime I drink this beer I find it to be consistent and refreshing. To me, it's definitely a seasonal drink, in as much as I tend to enjoy it on warmer days and less so when it's cooler.



Definite mild hoppiness, and discrete malts make this a beer that isn't huge on flavor but still manages to carry off an enjoyable experience. Don't get too caught up in the IPA/Pale Ale thing, because if you are expecting the large hoppiness of an American IPA you'll probably be disappointed. Suits me though, but some will be disappointed I'm sure."
Lagunitas Brewing Company,Olde GnarlyWine,,,American Barleywine,10.60%,bottle,4.58,5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,8/20/2004,"Yep, this is one hell of a beer!
The pour is a beautiful, full, solid amber affair with a lovely, dense, slightly off-white head. The head is formed by an excpetional array of bubbles that rise to the surface like small pieces of gold dust - it's a tremendous sight to see!
This is an amazingly well balanced brew with the malt, hops and alcohol content perfectly complimenting one another.
The taste is all honey to me, with a perfectly warm, rounded mouthfeel. It's georgous. Are you going to drink a lot of it? Certainly not, but that's not a problem this one is a beer to be enjoyed and savored over time.
Smashing!"
Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,Sierra Nevada Stout,,,American Stout,5.80%,bottle,2.63,4,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,8/20/2004,"Large head resulted from an agressive pour, but it disappointed quickly. After that it looked good with an opaque black, solid looking appearance.



A lot of bitterness in the whole taste and experience for me. Some of it wasn't really the usual burnt chocolate or dark malt and hops, it was simply bitter and rather unappealing. There didn't seem to be a real softer side to take the edge off the bitterness and as a result it left a clawing aftertaste that I was singularly unimpressed with. Somewhat ""un-stout"" like.



Aroma - I get very little of anything.



This isn't a *bad* beer as such, but like many other SN products I feel it is over-rated. By that I mean it attracts higher scores than other beers of similar or better quality simply because it is SN."
North Coast Brewing Co.,Pranqster,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,7.60%,bottle,3.83,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,8/19/2004,"Butterscotch pour with little or no head. Distinct aroma and taste of citrus spice, with cloves large up front. The alcohol acidity was a little too much for me. Bit of a bite on the way down that I didn't care for very much.



The cloudiness was really quite pronounced and some prickly acidity in the mouth made this a little less enjoyable that others of the style.



OK, but not one I'm rushing back to."

Dark brown, almost black pour with a large creamy head that receded very quickly. There was almost zero lacing with this beer.



The aroma I get is all chocolate fruit cake - like a Christmas cake! There is a smashing, fully rounded mouthfeel to this, with flavors of raisins and sultanas coming through strong. Lovely, warm malts round the beer.



This is an exceptionally smooth beer with no harsh edges which make it very drinkable. Add the nice ABV level and you've got a first class beer. In fact the alcohol seems to be almost completely shielded by the full and satisfying nature of this beer.



Beautiful!"
Lagunitas Brewing Company,Brown Shugga',,,American Strong Ale,9.99%,bottle,3.98,3.5,4,4,4,4,8/17/2004,"Golden brown pour with some cloudiness, very little head, no retention or any significant lacing.
Yes, the sugar is very evident all around, through the sweet aroma, the clinging taste, the aftertaste and the slick mouthfeel. The high ABV is also noticeable, but this beer does pull it off - just. Wave after wave of warming alcohol, but the drinkability is high (at least for the first glass).
I couldn't drink a lot of this, I don't know many that could, but nontheless a good sipper. Some dry aftertaste too."

The fact of the matter is, Baltika does another solid job of providing a nice quality, value for money beer.



Pours jet black, with the usual large head that receedes to yield the typically spotty, creamy head with some nice lacing. Very large mouthfeel, creamy satisfying beginning and end, with a little unexpected bitter bite in the finish.



7% ABV is very, very well disguised in thick, sweet malts with some lovely balance. Very filling and satisfying brew. Good job."
SweetWater Brewing Company,Sweetwater Georgia Brown,,,English Brown Ale,5.10%,bottle,3.55,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,8/15/2004,"Very clear, red-copper brown colored pour with a nice head that disappears quickly. I didn't get much of the nuttiness or the honey malt that is mentioned on the bottle.



Aroma is malty with what seems to be a real alcoholic tinge. The alcohol is not carried through to the taste in any significant way though.



It certainly seems to me to be a very light example of a Brown Ale, perhaps I'm used to thicker ""English"" Brown Ales. Quite watery in the mouth, but this makes it refreshing and drinkable. There's a lot of sweetness here too, kind of sugary has opposed to fruity. 



Still, enjoyable, local performer that I would drink again."

Another somewhat unattractive beer as it sits in the glass looking dirty brown and murky. A typical nasty Dubbel look. The pour was much nicer with a real fizzy head, but it died way too quickly for me. The carbonation is over the top for me.
The aromas here are VERY complex and unusual. I get a lot of fruit, especially pears, but significant alcohol. Unusually the alcohol to me is really quite complicated, reminding me of a liquer rather than a pure ethanol type smell.
Overwhelming experience in terms of taste is the bitter drying characteristic and the way each sip seems different. Quite an experience, not one I greatly enjoyed. Also there is a very significant amount of lambic/barnyard funk that for me at least, is out of place.
A complex beer to me that I suspect is *generally* held in higher regard than it should be. The taste suggests a much higher ABV than 6.2%. I expect lots of people will be very excited by this beer, but it doesn't really do much for me. However, I can recognize and understand how many BA's will rate this highly."

Pours a golden ""mustard"" color with substantial rocky white head. Looks superb, with an attractive amount of head retention and lacing on the glass.
A touch of funky tartness (but muted) with plenty going on. A complex array of sugars, alcohol and diverse spice.
Some similarities between this and the Witte by Ommegang - a bit of a house yeast thing going on for me. One major difference was the more pronounced alcohol start and finish. A little too much carbonation for my taste (the cork popped with alarming vigor) which was also true of the Witte, but still a refreshing beer that I enjoyed.
Probably another good beer to get the macro crowd introduced and involved to better beer. Not spectacular, but different and enjoyable enough to get them interested. Goes down easy and good value."

Pours brown with a very nice head, good lacing and some first class retention. A simple American Pale Ale. By that I mean a brew that stands out from the micro crowd by a mile, but is lost amongst hundreds of other similar examples. Very drinkable, very nice, but little to report overall.



Some good up front, lasting hops, enjoyable, but nothing to write home about."

Very strange this one, I would not have guessed this was supposed to be a Pilsner had I not known. Looks like a standard macro lager, but had a very odd taste. I thought it was spicy, not a mild spice either, quite a pronounced peppery type taste.



Having said that, it was refreshing, cold and enjoyable. I would like to give this another chance. Decent macro type pour with a nice head that hung around a little.



Not bad, a bit odd, needs more research!"

Took me a long time to get around to reviewing this. I've been treating this as a good staple to pick up around Atlanta for some time.



Pours a slightly hazy, orange color with a frothy head. The aroma is one of the few that I feel I can really easily recognize - it's peaches! The hops here are not as pronounced as the style usually demands, but in my book that's a good thing. For others that will be a negative mark. For me, much more well balanced than many other American IPA's.



Very refreshing with a lingering bitter aftertaste that I would describe as satisfying.



A nice, characterful beer."

I had heard an awful lot about this brew, most of it very good so I had high expectations. As is often the case, the hype was somewhat misplaced.
Nice looking pint, with a real golden color, decent head, with good retention and some lacing. This beer was much lighter than I was expecting. I found the aroma, taste and mouthfeel reallly, really light - quite refreshing, but somewhat lacking in complexity and depth. Now, don't get me wrong, it was still a nice beer and I would certainly recommend it, but not to get over excited about it.
Nice, easy drinking beer."

Very similar to the Rochefort 6.



A very large head came with this pour, with a significant amount of sediment despite a careful pour. Not sure about that at all.



The overwhelming experience here for me is alcohol and that really wasn't to my liking. Like the ""6"" I found the appearance less than attractive with the dirty brown cloudiness being the overall impression. My wife described the aroma as that of, ""Old Barrels"", that I took to be a compliment!



This beer is warm on the way down, and obviously has a high ABV, but I feel it is lacking in charm, drinkability and subtlety. I don't dislike it, but like the ""6"" I feel it represents very poor value for money. I can understand the appeal, just not my cuppa!"

Very attractive, pale orange, clear pour with a nice head with some good retention and a little lacing.



Blast of floral hops up front, that softens but lingers, giving a surprisingly bitter finish. It certainly wasn't very bitter, but much more than I was expecting.



Malts here are subdued.



Enjoyable, and quite meaty brew for such a light color and the style. Good value and well worth investigating when in Atlanta."

Pours with a lot of fizziness, almost like a coke! The appearance is not especially attractive, a dirty brown cloudiness. I got about 1/3 of an inch of frothy head that faded to a nice thin layer of retention for the whole drink.
The mouthfeel is good, with some creamy fullness. I noticed a distinct lack of aroma, an alcohol blast at the finish of the drink and a distinctly dry ending. Not especially enjoyable.
As the drink warms it becomes less harsh, more fruity and more drinkable.
I found the beer quite filling, but not something I'm going to be reaching for again soon. These's simply way too many better value for money beers out there."
Foster's Group Limited,Foster's Lager,,,American Adjunct Lager,5.00%,bottle,3.08,3.5,2.5,3,3.5,3.5,8/7/2004,"Frankly, I think it depends on what you're expecting and the context of your consumption what you might write about this beer. 



If you're looking for something cold, clean and refreshing then you could do much worse. If you're looking for anyhting outside of that context then you might as well forget it.



A bit better than the standard macro adjunct appearance, with a decent head, good color and a little more body than I was expecting. Head goes quickly though, no lacing, but the drink still goes down pretty smooth. Mouthfeel is better than most of the same style and just about does the job it's supposed to do.



Not bad."
Harpoon Brewery,UFO Hefeweizen,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,5.10%,on-tap,1.88,1.5,1.5,2,2,2,8/1/2004,"Very disappointing when I drank it at BB's in Memphis.
I suspect that this is a brew that can vary depending on the place you drink it. The care that it is kept under and served with is likely to make a difference. I always feel that this style is particularly sensitive to it's treatment when served on-tap.
Poor listless appearance. The Wheats/Hefe/Wits always have the potential to look like cold dishwater, and without a rocky head, good retention and lacing they can be somewhat unattractive. This pour had no reedeeming features and didn't look good at all. Some spiciness in the aroma but very little that I would normally want and expect from the style.
Taste here was very bland with a biting combination of bitterness and carbonation at the end. Thin mouthfeel completed the disappointing experience.
I would be happy to give this another chance since I don't believe that this beer can be as bad as I experienced it. The bottle may be different and perhaps another on-tap experience would be nicer too, but for now a low score from me."
Abbaye de Leffe S.A.,Leffe Blonde,,,Belgian Pale Ale,6.60%,bottle,4.38,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,7/31/2004,"HUGE nostalgia beer for me - sipping this outside Cafes in Belgium, Holland and France for years and years tends to leave a warm memory with you when you're relegated to sipping beer in Atlanta!!

Subsequently, $7.99, Six Pack, Green's Beverage, Ponce de Leon, Atlanta, GA.
 
I know that for the real purists this is a bit of let down in terms of the style, but I think this is a SMASHING beer! Yes it has the Interbrew spectre hanging over it - But you know what? I still like it.
The color is truly spectacular - a bright golden orange color. It pours with a little too much carbonation for my liking, but it settles down in the glass pretty quickly.
Is it sweet? Certainly. Is it fruity? Certainly. But I simply enjoy the sweet alcoholic, fruitiness that this fine ale imparts. It's not to everyone's liking, but I could drink this stuff forever.
The mouthfeel is full, with just the right amount of malts and spices to make this a really satisfying beer. What I like about this stuff is the fact that when I've had a few, it feels like I've really enjoyed a beer. A little buzz, with a lovely, lingering taste experience. Great stuff, great value."

Great looking pour (had to ask for a glass) with a nice frothy head that lasted the entire drink.



I seldom review beers twice but in the bottle this always seems more bitter to me, might be just my imagination but there appears to be a much harsher edge that I don't get on draught. Still has that lovely neutral, orange pour and the crisp, light bitterness."
Guinness Ltd.,Harp Lager,,,Euro Pale Lager,5.00%,on-tap,2.53,3,2,2.5,2.5,3,7/30/2004,"100% forgettable. Simply characterized as a standard lager, slightly above the quality of most North American macro's but lost in that sea of mediocrity that lies between those American domestics and the quality European lagers.



Appearance is OK (at least for 30 seconds) before the ""at first decent"" head dissipates to nothing. The smell? Well, smells like beer!! Slight grainy aroma with alcohol coming through strong. As is the usual case in American bars, the Arctic temperature that it is served at quells any significant aromas or tastes before it warms up a little. When it does, it gets slightly better doing a decent job of refreshing. Carbonation is a little prickly for me too.



I wouldn't throw this stuff away, but there would be 100's of others in the queue before it. Average in the extreme."

This is one ""beer"" that I will actually seriously consider turning down in preference for something non-alcoholic. I don't recall that EVER happening before.



What concerns me about this ""product"" is the way that it has been clearly created to fill a perceived (and perhaps) real niche in the market. The very fact that AB has the balls to put this on the shelves and at the same time even consider itself a brewer is an insult to me. I assume that AB themselves believe that products such as Bud are decent enough beers, and even if BA's disagree, the people that make those beers would be happy to stand behind their products and defend them. I find it difficult to believe they could or would with this bilge. That's a troubling thought considering the generally low quality of macro products in general."

There are some seriously sweet, sherry like aromas. This is a soft drinking, sweet stout, with a medium body that gives a mouthfeel larger than one would expect. However it doesn't suffer from excessive sweetness that some of the Milk Stouts can. The bitterness is mild, but persistent. It's evident at the start of the drink and all the way through in a way that is unusual (I find that most stouts give a creamy start and a bitter finish).

Really very nice. I was expecting little, but got much more. 



A very attractive light amber/orange pour with a white rocky head. Some good lacing. The carbonation is lively. Extremely refreshing with an excellent balance of hops and malt. The hops are exactly as I like them, under-stated but evident.



This is a clean drink, as refreshing as a light ""lawnmower"" adjunct lager, but obviously much tastier and of a distinctly higher quality.

Little or no ""pop"" to the opening of the corked and caged 750 mL bottle, but a lot of effervesence on the pour.



Wonderful golden yellow color and decent head with some lacing. Rather thin mouthfeel, but classic clove aroma and taste undertone. (The bottle mentions corriander, and there are certainly spices, but to me they are more clove-like in character)



A little prickly in the mouth too, from the carbonation. Somewhat watery feel in the mouth. The mouthfeel here was a big let down of an otherwise very nice beer.

Black, but with some reddish brown hints, a small creamy head that didn't last long. There is a distinct burned coffee aroma to this one, and a lot of dark chocolate tastes. Not chocolate that is smooth and creamy, but more like bitter chocolate. Nice balance of malt and hops, with a pleasing bitterness for me - not too much, not too little. I found the chicory to be fairly undetectable which I was surprised about, maybe I had a somewhat less than clean palate at the time.

A very thin experience with very little out of the ordinary to recommend it. The pour, appearance and aroma were all disappointing to me, I was expecting a far more exciting ""look"" to the beer. Yellow, cloudy color with a fast disappearing head, it was flat and seemed to have the hop character slightly out of balance.

Very mild banana and cloves.

PBR - a legend? Well, its reputation clearly goes before it, and helps it get reviewed in a generally far more favorable light than it really should. This is a fairly nasty swill that I don't think deserves a lot of the praise it gets. It seems to benefit from the idea that if lots of people used to drink it, it must be a classic. I see no more than classic, North American flavored water.
Standard grainy aroma and pale appearance with the usual lack of head and no lacing. Typical in all respects except when it comes to mouthfeel. PBR is one of the thinnest beers I recall ever drinking.

The color and aroma are almost 100% missing, and all I remember about drinking this stuff is that the combination of carbonation and coldness give a sandpaper effect to its consumption. If all beer were like this then I would have never bothered to drink the stuff ever again. On the plus side I don't think Bud Light is attempting to be anymore than it really is - cheap, macro crap, but what I find especially depressing is the fact that 99.99% of America considers this to be standard fare.

The brewery was in the process of some sort of move from the premises when I visited and the normal large selection was down to two or three. I suspect that this may have been a batch they were just getting rid of.

Classic black pour, with a small but creamy head. I like my Porters to exhibit that creamy quality and the smoothness of this beer is really rather good. Not quite up to the standard of my favorite, St. Peter's, but nevertheless a fine example.



Aroma is that of some burned malt, and the hops are well understated until the end. Another beer that I would recommend to people who were out to try something new without getting scared off."

The problem here I think, is that once one has opened up one's horizons to quality beer, stuff like Miller Lite is hardly what one would consider to be ""beer"" at all.
Is Miller Lite a refreshing, ice-cold, alcoholic beverage? Well, yes I guess potentially it is.
Is Miller Lite a carefully crafted balance of quality ingredients, brought together in a loving and balanced fashion to produce a deeply satisfying experience? Err...well, you can make up your own mind, but then again, nobody is really claiming that it is.
Miller pours the regular pale yellow, piss color, and is often served so cold that any possible taste and aroma are completely undetectable anyway. Often no head, this ""beer"" is best enjoyed in 100 degree heat, when the emphasis required is on ""wet"" rather than any other experience.

This may be the most flat, uninteresting beer I've ever drunk. It looks EXACTLY like iced-tea, with a cloudy, orange hue and absolutely no head or carbonation despite an agreesive pour. Aroma is non-existent and the taste, well, watery would be a compliment.

It's a drinkable macro, that has some saving graces, but they are few and far between. In a pinch, it's beer - and that can't be a bad thing (hardly ever, anyway).



Certain caramel character in this brew that certainly has the look of a coke when poured. A decent head initially, is almost all gone the second that the beer settles in the glass. I detect the usual grainy aroma, but no unpleasant skunkiness or strong alcohol aromas (good things). I can drink this stuff, but that's about as far as my compliments go.

Excellent, creamy head, flatters to deceive. The rest of the drink is pretty watery, fairly non-descript with a distinct lack of aroma or significant yeast or malt flavors. The brew looks good with a characteristic orangey cloudiness, but after that head and the initial look, it's largely downhill from there.

It seems to have everything in the perfect proportion. The color and the voluptuous head, the lemon and yeast aromas, perfectly balanced hops and malts and just the right amount of alcohol to make the package near perfect. It's just about as drinkable as a beer can be, it's 100% quality.
Only one cloud on the horizon, I'm not sipping it in a French or Belgian Cafe as I did so often before coming to the US. Those places are infinitely more refined, less crass and able to support a level of socialized behavior that beers like this demand, that will never, ever appear in the USA."

The aroma and taste are all, soft, round, ripe forest fruits, and the brew itself is rich. The combination reminds me of a berry smoothie! Mouthfeel is very full, rich and creamy and this is amazingly drinkable. Of course the ease of drinking and the 9.00% ABV make this a combination that needs your respect.

Very cloudy pour, despite great care taken, and initially the overwhelming experience is sweet. I get a lot of burned sugar smells in the aroma and in the initial taste. I found that it filled the mouth with an alcohol taste above anything else. Some very thin lacing and a fast receding head.
Mouthfeel is just a little on the thin side for the style, and the alcohol is not well hidden. I like more body and more fruit in my darker Begians and this doesn't provide either very well.
Nevertheless, still a pretty good beer that I would certainly class as drinkable, if generally generally overrated."

To me this beer has an extremely light feel to it despite the ABV. For that reason it is a beer that needs respect, simply because before you know it, you could have consumed a lot of pretty potent beer.
I detected a lot of honey sweetness in the aroma and the taste, and coupled with the color and the light feel, this reminded me of a little of a cream ale.

I was extremely surprised at how drinkable this was. I always feel that as one gets to 9-10% ABV you are getting into territory that can force you just to have one or two of a particular beer before reaching for something much less demanding. However, it seemed like this could be consumed at an alarming rate of knots! Take Care!

This is Sweetwater's flagship offering and it is simply put, steady and reliable.



Very nice offering, a drinkable beer that strikes a very good balance between hop bitterness and malty sweetness. The pour from draught is attractive with an orangey cloudy hue to the beer and a thin head that disappears fairly quickly. I detected very little aroma, but I often think that this is due to tthe excessive chilling that so much beer in the US is exposed to. As it warms things get better.



There is a definite sweet start to the drink that fades to a bitterish finish. The bitterness is mild and enjoyable.

July 1st 2004, First day of higher ABV beers being legally sold in GA!
I often fail to pick up and identify fruity aromas in general, but with this beer it's all ripe bananas and pears with a faint alcohol tinge. Yeasty bread too. The breadiness of the beer continues well into the taste and it dominates rather than the Belgian yeast strain and candy elements that sometimes ride high in beers of this style.
It pours a dark brown, slightly murky color with a good head made up of small bubbles and quite light. Good lacing.
The taste? Well to me it's a little on the sweet side. I like malty sweetness, and I like strong brews, but this one doesn't quite strike the perfect balance for me. Don't get me wrong, it's a classic, well established and superb Quad but when you get up to 10% ABV, you have to be pretty careful with the balance and the taste, or things can go awry fairly quickly. The alcohol content coupled with the sweetness are *almost* a little too much in combination; certainly this is not a brew you could drink much of in any one sitting.
Mouthfeel is a little lacking depth for me. Not exactly thin, but not really as substantial as you would expect for this type of brew.
A classic example of the style with much to endear it but despite that, for me it's an occasional rather than a regular in the rotation."

A cloudy brown pour that really isn't all that attractive, but there is a beautiful rock foam atop that makes a great decoration. The whole brew is chock full of taste, with the sweetness and bitterness in just the correct proportion. The ABV is strong enough to give the beer its edge, but not too much as to overpower it.

I don't smell much, but that is not necessarily a bad thing, at least I'm not getting an overpowering alcohol or grain whiff.



Pours with a slightly better than average head and retention and goes down quite smooth. Golden in the glass with a clarity about it. Malts mainly dominate, but I don't know that this looks or tastes much like a Pale Ale as the database suggests. Looks more like a pale lager to me and has all the hallmarks of that brew.

New Century Brewing Company,Edison Light Beer,,,Light Lager,4.00%,bottle,3.4,3.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,4,6/26/2004,"A surprisingly enjoyable experience.
A very sweet malty experience with a light hop after taste. As usual I came to this brew with some pre-conceived ideas, but as can happen, I was pleasantly surprised.
A very clean looking presentation with the clear bottle and the deep yellow color, the beer pours with more head, carbonation and body than most other light lagers. The first tastes are refreshing and this is maintained throughout the drink. 
Not bad at all! Might even go there again."
Rogue Brewery (Brewer's on the Bay),Honey Cream Ale,,,Cream Ale,5.50%,bottle,3.35,2.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,6/26/2004,"Definitely honey and creaminess to this brew. It pours a hazy orange color which I don't think is especially attractive. Quite smooth, but like most Rogues, I find the hop aroma and the general hop character much too big for the beer itself. It doesn't matter that the hops in this beer are really quite small for a Rogue brew, they still seem to overpower the style that the beer should have. I was only introduced to Rogues a few months ago and after the initial delight at finding something more tasty than usual I am beginning to find their hops and associated drying capacity a little too much for my palate."
Buffalo Bill's Brewery,Orange Blossom Cream Ale,,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,5.20%,bottle,4.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,6/25/2004,"Wow! I was waiting to be disappointed by this, but what a shock, I really enjoyed it! Not being a big fan of fruit beers in general, I was expecting something quite different. Instead I got a crystal clear, lucozade colored, orange nosed, refreshing experience.



Aroma is all orange with a large frothy head that disappears quickly but offers good lacing. It goes down very quickly which was probably a combination of the hot weather and it's very light body. 



Normally a beer this light in body would seem very watery, but the fruit somehow makes that lightness OK. Very, very refreshing, a delightful change and alternative to a fizzy light beer for quenching thirst.



Nice one, would definitely buy again, but before recommending I would emphasize this beers novelty factor as being opposed to a mainstream good beer."
Smithwick's Brewery / Irish Ale Breweries Ltd,Smithwick's Ale,,,Irish Red Ale,4.50%,on-tap,3.43,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,6/25/2004,"Decent Irish bitter that is a nice change from the norm. 



Good dark red color with a creamy head that last well into the pint. The red ales are a little dry for my taste but it does measn that the beer has to be well balanced to still be enjoyable, Smithwicks manages to pull it off."
Abita Brewing Co.,Turbodog,,,English Brown Ale,5.60%,bottle,3.75,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,6/23/2004,"A nice Brown Ale.



Pours a very attractive red/brown color with a nice amount of carbonation to give a decent head that hangs around a bit. A tasty little number with plenty of maltiness and a bitter finish in just the right amount. Drinkable, good example of the style.



Lots of information about the hops and malt on the label. Makes me curious about Abita's other brews, I'll be following up with them later."
"Anheuser-Busch, Inc.",Budweiser,,,American Adjunct Lager,5.00%,bottle,2.1,2,1.5,2,2,3,6/23/2004,"I feel as though it is difficult to be incredibly objective about this beer simply because of its place on the North American macro stage, but here goes....
The standard appearance and aroma from a macro lager, a little skunky, pale yellow fizz with a head that disappears almost immediately with no lacing. The taste is that of a grainy alcohol with little or nothing else to report - what can one say? As one reviewer said earlier, ""better than water""!"
Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Hoegaarden Original White Ale,,,Witbier,4.90%,on-tap,4.53,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,6/22/2004,"A classic of its type. Despite the plaudits that I hear for other, more ""trendy"" and expensive beers of the style, for me Hoegaarden continues to be consistently excellent.



It's appearance is really second to none. The cloudiness perfectly compliments the yellow coloration and the aroma and taste never fail to back up its great looks.



The citrus and spice come through in exactly the correct amount and the refreshing ability of this beer is largely unmatched.



I like this, a lot!"
Pivzavod Baltika / Baltic Beverages Holding,Baltika #1 Light,,,Euro Pale Lager,4.40%,bottle,3.33,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,6/20/2004,"$2.19, Arbor Place Beverage Depot, Douglasville, GA.



Incredibly light colored beer, with the standard macro smell, head and appearance. Although this beer has a macro feel to it it gets a slightly higher rating from me because it is a little smoother and more drinkable.



When cooled to very low temperatures this provides a better and more refreshing alternative with non-offensive malts and a bitterness that is very mild. Enjoyable, but nothing to write home about."

St. Peter's does it again with this beautifully flavorful yet light beer. This is beer gives a combo which I find so difficult to find. A real tasty, hoppy, perfectly balanced brew that feels truly refreshing and drinkable.



Pours the golden color that the name promises, with a beautiful head with stacks of lacing throughout the drink. Malts start the taste experience but this quickly gives way to perfectly balanced bitterness. That bitterness doesn't linger, it fades to leave you wanting more. A classic."
United Breweries - UB Group,Taj Mahal Premium Lager,,,American Adjunct Lager,4.50%,bottle,3.25,3.5,3,3.5,3,3,6/19/2004,"Not bad, I've had worse, fairly typical for an Indian lager. This is reminiscent of your standard macro, but with a little drier, harder, bite. I like it as long as it's very well chilled and I'm eating with it. I've drunk a lot of this stuff with Indian food, but it will do a good job with any spicy offering.



An attractive pour with good golden color and a substantial head that hangs around for most of the drink. It's dryish with a bitter ending and some metallic characteristics. Nothing special in the malts that are present."

Black pour with a somewhat flat head that had little or no retention and no lacing. After what I had heard and read about this beer I was slightly disappointed in its appearance.



Incredibly detailed label listing, by name, all 14 malts in the brew, serving instructions (including type of glass and chilling procedure), freshness date etc.



I enjoyed this, but not because I felt it was excpetional, just because I enjoy the style. The usual coffee and creamy experience of a Porter, but I like mine a little sweeter. Still drinkable and probably a more traditional example than some of the sweeter brews I have come to like. Nice, but not stunning."
Würzburger Hofbräu AG,Julius Echter Hefe-Weissbier Dunkel,,,Dunkelweizen,4.90%,bottle,2.53,4,3,2.5,2,2,6/18/2004,"$2.99, Harry's Farmers Market, Marietta, GA, USA.



Didn't really enjoy this at all. It looked very good, lovely amber color with a nice looking ample head, but that's where the experience ended for me.



A clawing dryness came with each mouthful and a very distinct diluted experience came with the brew as a whole. Distincly unflavorful, watery lack of body characterized it for me."
Bath Ales Ltd,Gem,,,Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB),4.80%,bottle,4.35,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,6/17/2004,"$2.99, Greens Beverage, Atlanta, GA.



Guess what? A GEM! Beautifully balanced, light body with stacks of malty flavor and a crisp, bitter finish. Pours and looks like a cask-conditioned real English Bitter with a great malt aroma and a lightness to the drink that means you could consume a lot of this. 



The hop balance seems just right, tasty but never overpowering the malty delicateness.



Full of character, this kind of brew appears too few and far between. Good value too, better than many higher priced offerings. Lovely!"

It looks good and you can drink a lot of this stuff, but the nitro cans (smoothflow) are simply a pale shadow of real Tetley's. I am biased, because after you drunk the real stuff only yards from the brewery in Leeds pubs, you are unlikely to be impressed by a nitro-can clone.
It's such a shame that a great beer and a great brewery feels the commercial pressure to go down this route to produce beers that are simply inferior to their roots. Quite sad really.
WE ARE LEEDS, marching on together!"

I got an enormous head with this bottle all the way to the end of the drink. It actually got quite frustrating as I was pouring it!



A spicy aroma to this classic unfiltered German. Not my favorite style, but an excellent example. The huge snowy peaks of froth were actually getting in the way of enjoying this and the carbonation seemed excessive.



Even with an incredibly delicate decant this bottle still ended up sending some sediment into the glass.



A slightly hazy golden yellow color. A nice beer, but lets keep it in perspective."
Grupo Modelo S.A. de C.V.,Pacífico,,,American Adjunct Lager,4.80%,bottle,2.25,2.5,2,2.5,2,2,6/9/2004,"The usual report on this kind of stuff.
Pours pale yellow, fizzy head that disappears quickly, is thin in the mouth and generally forgettable.
Mine tasted slightly metallic and infinitely better after three or four bottles, with lime added, in the scorching heat. If you are just going to have one, when it is not 100 degrees and without lime, forget it. Just one of the thousands of macro, adjunct lagers that are 100% non-descript."
Miller Brewing Co.,Red Dog,,,American Adjunct Lager,5.00%,bottle,1.6,1.5,1.5,1.5,1.5,2,6/9/2004,"$4.15 for six-pack, Save-Rite supermarket, Villa Rica, GA, USA.
On the plus side, $4.15 for a six-pack, you know what you're getting - not much, but it doesn't pretend to be much. You are also getting 5.00% ABV.
On the down side, well - pours like piss, looks like piss, tastes like piss - might even be piss! Never mind, no more or less than I expected. There are scores of better crappy, macro alternatives (e.g. Miller High Life, Schlitz), turn to them first."
Pivovar Staropramen Praské Pivovary,Staropramen Lager,,,Czech Pilsener,5.00%,bottle,2.93,3.5,2.5,3,3,3,6/9/2004,"Like merlin48, my label looked slightly different to the one pictured, but I'm pretty sure I am reviewing the correct beer.



I feel this is a sound example of a pilsner. A Nice golden color with the correct amount of carbonation and a good sharp bite. Decent head, but as is often the case this faded very fast. A definite skunky aroma, but I associate that with most Pils anyway. It's not my favorite style by any means because I always find them rather dry, but not a bad beer. I don't like my lighter colored lagers so hoppy, but I would certainly visit this again."
RCH Brewery,Old Slug Porter,,,English Porter,4.50%,bottle,3.63,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,6/9/2004,"$4.99 Arbor Beverage, Douglasville, GA.



Mmm, mildly disappointed, but tempered by my love for Porters in general. This brew probably resembles the style in a truer fashion than some of the more contemporary beers, but was a little too smoky, a little too bitter and a little less smooth than I have become accustomed to in a Porter. This would not be my first choice, and I believe there are plenty of other cheaper, better beers of similar style out there (St. Peter's Old Style Porter for example).



Gave a huge head with a non-aggressive pour, with lots of nice lacing - something we see too little of in general. Smoky, woody aromas and initial flavors with some mild bitterness in the aftertaste is not what I have become familiar with. This Porter lacked the real smoothness and creaminess of many others.



Still, a nice beer that I would recommend and go back to myself."

I must admit I was getting ready to be disappointed by this, thinking that it would be simply a poor quality import designed to con the locals by making them think it was something exotic. In the end I was very happily surprised.



Poured a beautiful deep red/brown color with some decent head and retention and some good lacing. Delightfully malty aroma that is replicated in the taste. The sweet malts really come through strong with no hint of bitterness. One of the ""maltiest"" beers of had in a long time. It finished really creamy and left me wanting more. The caramel highlights were - well - a highlight!



I expect this will be too sweet for many people, but I thought it was an excellent beer that I will visit again. Not necessarily one I would want to drink all the time, but a nice brew. Pleasantly surprised."

Unfortunately the initial experience of this beer was the aroma that was unpleasant! A real stinky, vomit type smell! Once I'd got over that it was really quite good.
A dark pour with an attractive tan head that fades fast. I wasn't expecting such a dark color for something that advertises itself as a lager. As I drank it, I began to have more of a ""Porter"" experience with some creaminess coming through. A nice brew that I would like to revisit (with a peg on my nose)!"

Not bad. Pretty average, wouldn't get too excited about it considering the cost. Reminded me a lot of Sam Adams. Poured a dark copper color with some head that faded fast. A little lacing. I think I was drinking this brew too cold. The coldness gave it a sharp bubbly feel that I did not enjoy. Once it had warmed up a little it got better. Nice balance of malt and hops. OK."
Grupo Modelo S.A. de C.V.,Corona Extra,,,American Adjunct Lager,4.60%,can,2,2,2,2,2,2,6/6/2004,"To me this is no worse or better than it pretends to be. It's North American macro lager, so what do you expect? Like all of these brews, it's pale, pours with a lot of carbonation that disappears instantly to leave no head and no lacing, invariably smells skunky, isn't easy to drink, often gives headaches when drunk in quantity and generally is a nasty experience.



Add in the fact that Corona appears to the lack the thirst-quenching properties of similar beers and you've just about said it all."
Rogue Brewery (Brewer's on the Bay),Dead Guy Ale,,,Maibock / Helles Bock,6.50%,bottle,3.65,4,3.5,4,3.5,3,6/6/2004,"$1.49 per bottle as apart of mixed six-pack from World Market, Marietta, GA.



To me, Rogue beers seem to be consistently over-rated. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy them, but I am consistently expecting more from them.



This brew pours a cloudy orange color with absolutely no head. As hoppy as ever for Rogue, that, together with the color and the ""flatness"", reminded me of a classic cask-conditioned English ale. It was very rounded and full flavored in the mouth - a nice experience. Finished quite bitter. I enjoyed it.



Definitely worth another visit."
Birra Moretti (Heineken),Birra Moretti,,,Euro Pale Lager,4.60%,bottle,3.38,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,6/5/2004,"$1.49 per bottle as part of mixed six pack, World Market, Marietta, GA.



355 mL. Pours a vary plae straw color with little or no head. Some significant lacing throughout the drink. This brew is another good example of the style, encapsulating what a decent lager should. Extremely clean and refreshing, with good balance of bitterness and grain. Certainly one to visit again."
Greene King / Morland Brewery,Abbot Ale,,,English Pale Ale,5.00%,nitro-can,3.45,3.5,2.5,3.5,4,4,5/29/2004,"Another example of a super keg beer being completely neutralized by putting in a nitro-can. The stuff in the can is virtually unrecognizable in experience to the original, which in this case is a step back. OK - what can you say about these nitro brews? They all pour to give beautiful, perfectly formed pints, they are all super-smooth and they are all really drinkable (like milkshakes), but so what? All the character of the Abbot is lost in this commercialization process. Shame. There is still a little recognizable bitterness that comes through in the aftertaste, but apart from that it's just blandness that rules again."
Redhook Ale Brewery,Redhook ESB,,,Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB),5.77%,bottle,3.83,2.5,3.5,4,4,4,5/29/2004,"Very odd color for an ESB - it's much too plae and yellow, but putside of that, pretty nice.



Sharp and clean taste to this increasingly common brew. It has some characteristics of an amber ale. Pours really nicely with a couple of fingers worth of bubbly head, but little or no lacing. Another beer which will benefit from a little warming up. I found it refreshing with a clean, dry aftertaste. 



Sugared grapefruit in the taste and surprisingly hoppy given the Genesis of this beer.



Definitely one to try if you are not familiar."
Rogue Brewery (Brewer's on the Bay),Mocha Porter,,,American Porter,5.30%,bottle,2.68,4,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,5/29/2004,"In typical Rogue fashion this is an extremely hoppy offering with a lot of body and plenty of bitterness. For me, for this to be described as a Porter is misleading. It's much more like a stout. From the tan bubbly head, through the bitter and hops, onto the smokiness, right through to the dry aftertaste, this has none of the creaminess or the smoothness that I associate with the best, most drinkable Porters. Don't get me wrong, Rogue makes some fine beers, but as a Porter this isn't one of them. Having said that if this had a different label that included the word stout, I would probably more sympathetic. In short, it's OK, but I won't be back anytime soon. A bit of a disappointment - at least from the Porter angle."
Scottish & Newcastle UK Ltd.,Newcastle Brown Ale,,,English Brown Ale,4.70%,bottle,3.63,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,5/29/2004,"Another beer that seemes to have changed a lot since I first drank it. There are certainly two factors that are influencing this. Firstly the American insistence on serving this stuff at temperatures which are simply too cold. Then (to add insult to injury) serving it in frosted mugs! Why oh why this obsession? This is much better enjoyed at room temperatures, or at least removed from the fridge for some time before consumption. 



Once it's up to a decent temperature this is a sweet brown ale with a distinctive taste that I find difficult to place. The malts are certainly a little out of the ordinary and I think this is the key. I don't know if it is my imagination, but this beer is only which has apparently become a little lighter and watery as it has become more commercially successful .Might be just my imagination. Not as good as it used to be, but still holds its own."
Guinness Ltd.,Guinness Draught,,,Irish Dry Stout,4.20%,nitro-bottle,3.95,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,5/23/2004,"Ahh, Guinness. Probably the single most varied experience depending on location and serving type out of any beer worldwide. And that's the problem with this stuff - the search for consistency.



In this particular case (the ""draught"" nitro bottle) we are treated to something that looks like ""draught"" Guinness but that's about where the similarities end. This stuff has a watered down smoothness and is consequently less heavy the ""draught"". It means that the taste, mouthfeel and general experience are not comparable to real draught, but it does make this stuff incredibly drinkable in significant quantities! What I've always liked about Guinness, is that for a stout, it is light. I like the relative blandness and drinkability that I find more challenging in some of the heavier stouts. Certainly less flavor, but easier to consume in quantity."
St. Peter's Brewery Co Ltd,St. Peter's Cream Stout,,,Milk / Sweet Stout,6.50%,bottle,4.75,5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,5/23/2004,"It's all chocolate, it's all burned coffee, it's all rich, deep aromas and tastes, and it's all spectacular! St. Peter's does it again with this stunning stout. An experience more than a drink, with the aromas and tastes wooing the senses - I love it. Pours jet black with a beautiful tan head that invites you in. The initial tastes are sweet and chocolatety and it just gets deeper and richer from there. This is a brew to savor and to indulge in. Enjoy."
Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),Samuel Adams Boston Lager,,,Vienna Lager,4.90%,bottle,3.73,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,5/22/2004,"Above average macro/micro that I am happy to fall back on in the absence of an extensive range of options. It's consistent - and that's important.
A simple beer but does the job every time I enjoy a couple of bottles. Very light and fluffy, bubbly head with some small amount of lacing. The aroma is a simple malt base with some sweetness. Amber hue typifies the style and reflects the malt bill nicely.
Nice malty, balanced bitterness is the key, and a smoothness that is usually missing from mass produced beers. The tangy bitterness is balanced by some sweetness too.
A decent offering that does the job."
"Cervecería Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma, S.A. de C.V.",Tecate,,,American Adjunct Lager,4.50%,bottle,2.83,2.5,2,3,2.5,3.5,5/22/2004,"This is as about as bland a beer as one could imagine. Having said that it does have a distinct advantage over it's northern cousins in that it is fairly inoffensive. Most of the American macro lagers lack a cleanliness, and you often get really offensive skunkiness and nasty alcohol aromas and tastes. Tecate has none of that, and as a result is a refreshing, thirst quencher despite a lack of body and taste. My advice - take it for whait is, drink it ice-cold in hot weather and you won't be too disappointed. Look for anythg much beyond that and you will. Not bad - it does the job it's supposed to and not much else."
Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,Sierra Nevada Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),5.60%,on-tap,3.85,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,5/22/2004,"Significantly better on draught than in the bottle.



Hoppy, malty and tasty, this is a very nice, often available oasis of a drink, in an frequently hopeless desert of North American macro's. A very good example of the style that I enjoy reverting back to as a steady staple of (unspectacular) quality and consistency.



Always a decent body and color with a good head, nice bitterness and a well rounded ending. This is a satisying beer as a commonly available and decent staple and I will continue to turn to it, but I find it generally over-rated (like many SN brews) with gushing praise often coming from some BA's and other, less informed drinkers. Nice brew, but let's keep it in perspective chaps!"
Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,Sierra Nevada Wheat Beer,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,4.40%,bottle,3.63,3.5,4,4,3.5,2.5,5/22/2004,"Nice. A real tasty little number. Pours the classic, cloudy unfiltered orangey yellow color with a decent head and some lacing. Malts are the initial aroma and flavors which lead to a much hoppier finish than I was expecting. I like the stumpy, short bottles of SN, and the labels are very attractive and colorful too. I do like this stuff, and it is certainly above average, but I find SN's products generally over-rated. To be honest a similar and better brew is the much under-rated and probably much maligned, Blue Moon. Purists tend to shun this Coors macro, but I like its value and drinkability ahead of this SN brew."
Warsteiner Brauerei,Warsteiner Premium Dunkel,,,Munich Dunkel Lager,4.90%,bottle,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,2,5/22/2004,"The Warsteiners I have sampled always seem to me to be complex tasting beers that appear to have a much higher alcohol content than they actually have. I find them enjoyable, but in small doses, otherwise they can lie pretty rough in the stomach and in the head! This brew poured a dark brown color (as expected) with a decent head that didn't last long. Plenty of bitterness and really rather drier than I was expecting. Not a beer to drink a lot of in my opnion, it seems to be too ""alcoholy"" to be quoffed. I can't put my finger on it, but this beer seems much stronger than it actually is."
Asahi Breweries Ltd,Asahi Super Dry,,,Japanese Rice Lager,5.00%,bottle,3.3,3.5,3,3.5,2.5,3.5,5/21/2004,"Not my favorite style by any means, but a little better than I was expecting. It poured a very respectable gold color, much nicer and more appetizing than I was anticipating. Taste was slightly malty with no trace of hops, but about standard for the genre. What I liked about it was the smoothness. It really went down well, but with nothing else to recommend it, that's about all I can say. This brew drank well and looked better than average, but it still has the feel of a wishy-washy American macro."
Fuller Smith & Turner PLC,Fuller's ESB,,,Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB),5.90%,bottle,4.55,4.5,5,4.5,4,4.5,5/21/2004,"12 oz bottle from the $9.99 six pack.
Guess what? Real beer. Not as good as drinking it only a few yards away from the brewery in Chiswick from a cask, but a pretty decent alternative out of the resplendent brown bottle that we get here in the US.
Fuller's ESB provides the quintessential biscuit malt base with fruit overtones and a gentle kiss of hoppy character that caps the whole thing. The beer produces a great head that lasts and gives some fantastic retention. Definite extra points for aroma - plenty of bread in there against the malt/fruit backdrop.
The body is slightly thinner in the bottle, and the finish a little drier than I would otherwise like, but these are not serious concerns. The tingling, prickly finish of the mouthfeel in the bottle also slightly detracts, but still immensely drinkable - basically a great British pint."
Heineken Nederland B.V.,Heineken Lager Beer,,,Euro Pale Lager,5.00%,can,2.15,2.5,1.5,2.5,2,2,5/21/2004,"I've drunk this stuff off and on for the best part of 25 years and frankly I'm very confused with its success and general popularity. I'm not sure, but I believe the general ignorance of the American beer drinking public allows this to be sold, priced and marketed as some kind of ""premium"" lager in the US. In England, this stuff is bog standard crappy lager. In its defense, I truly believe that it tastes different on the continent, with a more flavorful experience being the norm.



This stuff smells bad! It simply doesn't have an appetizing aroma. It looks, tastes and drinks real average, and I fail to see its general appeal. Often flat looking with poor head, it really fails to do anything for me. Try 1001 others for a better experience."
Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),Samuel Adams Summer Ale,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,5.20%,bottle,2.73,2.5,3,3,2.5,2,5/17/2004,"Here's my problem. To me, an Englishman, ""Ale"" always conjours up the image of cask-conditioned ales in pubs with roaring log fires. Associating an ""Ale"" with summer drinking seems, well frankly, silly! I like my summer drinks to be thirst quenchers, with much less about them.



This brew pours a cloudy orange, reminiscent of iced-tea. In the summer months I'd prefer the tea to this stuff. Very poor head, with a distinctly non-lemon aroma, despite the lemon addition being hightlighted on the label. A little malty taste with a pleasant bitter aftertaste were the highlights of this incredibly disappointing beer."
JOS. Schlitz Brewing Co. (Pabst),Schlitz,,,American Adjunct Lager,4.60%,can,2.83,3,3,2.5,2.5,3.5,5/16/2004,"16oz six pack, Publix Supermarket, Villa Rica, GA, $4.79.



Schlitz. Not being an American, or growing up with this beer I can't really comment on its legendary status, but I hear it is a classic. My wife tells me her father used to drink this when she was growing up and it seems to have a nostalgic affect on most Americans that I talk to about it.



Simply put, you get what you pay for - but frankly, I like it. This is a no-nonsense American lager that doesn't pretend to be what it's not. It's certainly not tasty, nor is it satisfying, but it is a cheap, cold, refreshing drink. Consumed chilled to the max on hot days, it's a decent brew (also see Miller High Life).



It pours with a much less incipid color than I was expecting, nor did it have an offensive aroma. A frothy, very carbonated head that fades quickly was apparent. There was no unpleasant aftertaste, nor the nasty, harsh, alcohol based flavor that can come with this genre. Actually, this beers non-offensive qualities and blandness are in its favor.



Not really beer as I know it (no taste, no color, no character), but a refreshing alcoholic drink non-the-less! I'd drink it again."

Very strange review this one. Essentially Miller High Life, is, at least on the face of it, everything I dislike in a beer. Light colored, no body and a distinct lack of taste (either hops or malt), a mass produced American macro with little or no appeal to those who enjoy quality beer...but...I keep on coming back to drink it. 



One thing it does have is absolutely first-class drinkability in hot weather. Living in Atlanta this gives it a head start. In addition it's cheap. Now, price isn't something I'm desperately concerned with, and I'll gladly pay enormous sums for good beer, but my philosophy is this; If the beer I'm drinking is a poor quality American, mass produced macro, then I might as well drink the cheapest since I'll be wasting the smallest amount of cash!



This beer still hits the slumming spot for me and it serves as an excellent benchmark for me to judge the rest of my beers against. For what it is, and the style, it's a good product."
Spoetzl Brewery,Shiner Hefeweizen,,,Hefeweizen,5.40%,bottle,3.03,3.5,3,3,3,3,5/2/2004,"Pours a pale orange color with cloudiness as expected. Very little head (at least without an aggressive pour). Lemon grass overtones in the aroma, a little too watery and ill-defined for my taste.
Less satisfying and more acidic that many in the same style, this is not in the same class. A poorer example of the style, even from an American perspective. A weak brew that could be so much better.
Having said all of that, it would do a job in blistering Atlanta summer heat."
Grupo Modelo S.A. de C.V.,Modelo Especial,,,American Adjunct Lager,4.40%,bottle,2.98,3.5,2,3,2.5,4,5/1/2004,"OK, make no mistake this is a fairly low quality beer, but it doesn't really pretend to be much else. It's simply a mexican lager that you're going to drink and enjoy when it's really hot or when you are eating spicy food. It's got to be mega-chilled (since doing that will not affect the taste or experience at all) and you've got to gulp it down quickly.



Golden yellow, thin looking pour, with highly carbonated head that disappears quickly. Not too unpleasant aroma and initial taste that this style can sometimes have, the lack of pure alcohol smell was pleasing and surprising.



I would drink this again, but not for the experience, just because it would do a certain job in a certain circumstance."
Yakima Brewing Co. / Bert Grant's Ales,Anvil Head,,,American Amber / Red Ale,?,bottle,3.83,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,5/1/2004,"Nice amber pour, but mine was with very little head and virtually no lacing. A very hoppy initial taste and aroma cut back some as the beer was drunk. Hops still prevail with some sweet malt. I enjoyed this purely from the point of view of having taste! So many brews in the US lack that basic requirement it's nice to come across tasty beers. I like the stout bottle, label and the name - all point to a decent, full flavored brew. The beer itself is unfiltered so invevitibly has cloudy appearance and like most tastier beers, I feel it benefits from not being cooled to Arctic temperatures.



Definitely worth a re-visit."
Molson Breweries Of Canada. Ltd.,Molson Golden,,,American Blonde Ale,5.00%,bottle,2.58,3,2,2.5,3,3,4/19/2004,"Six pack, twist top.
An aggressive pour gave this a full two fingers of head, with large bubbles at the top and smaller ones as you look down through the head. The head itself was foamy in appearance but disappeared quickly to leave a very small amount of lacing.
This is a pale golden colored brew that is rather bland. Having said that it was fairly refreshing. Unlike some nasty bland macros this didn't leave an unpleasant aftertaste and the overwhelming aroma and taste was NOT simply alcohol. There was a small amount of sweet maltiness, but very little (if any) hops and no bitterness.
Like so many macro's of it's type fairly forgetable, but still one of the better of the genre."
Bass Brewers Limited,Bass Pale Ale,,,English Pale Ale,5.00%,bottle,3.8,4,3.5,4,3,4,4/13/2004,"Here's my problem. Growing up - as a young lad in the early drinking days - when my father was trying to show me the ropes, we would often go to pubs where Cask Conditioned Bass was kept. My father would never let me drink anything else but that stunningly magnificent brew.



Many years later we come up to date, I am confronted by a label that says Bass, and I see the famous (oldest in the world I believe) red triangle trademark, but what's in the bottle bears no resemblance to those halcyon days.



Ho, hum. This is a mahogany brown pour with some head depending on the aggression, with a hoppy start but mild finish and aftertaste. The creaminess is always surprising to me. This is a beer which is routinely murdered in the USA simply by the temperature that it is served at. Bass brewers would be appalled. In my opinion this needs to be a room temperature serving, nowhere near a refrigerator, let alone coming out of huge containers of ice.



Cask conditioned draught it isn't, better than many it is. My advice, don't drink this when you are out, get a twelve pack, let it warm up and enjoy it at home in leisure."
Hatuey Brewery,Hatuey Lager Beer,,,American Adjunct Lager,5.50%,bottle,2.85,3,3,3,2.5,2.5,4/3/2004,"Very suprised to find this at a small package store in a very Hispanic part of Atlanta. I got into a conversation with the Cuban owner of the store who informed me that it was legal to sell this stuff, since despite the map of Cuba on the label, it is brewed in Puerto Rico. He was VERY enthusiastic about it!



It poured a nice golden color with a decent head and aroma. Drank like an average lager, something I would drink in the summer months only. Pretty undistinct really, I thought it had marginally more taste than an American macro, but not much. 



If you get a chance, definitely try this one, but generally fairly average."
Sapporo Breweries Ltd.,Sapporo Original Draft Beer,,,Japanese Rice Lager,5.00%,can,3.53,3,2.5,3.5,3,5,3/28/2004,"There's no doubt about the fact that this is an average beer on most levels. Certainly in terms of appearance (very pale) and taste (extremely mild) there are thousands of better alternatives, but this brew has amazing thirst quenching qualities. It really is very, very drinkable. In fact the drinkablity is absolutely exceptional.



This stuff looks like a pale macro produced US based lager, but drinks 100 times better. It's smoother and less offensive to the taste. Chilled to the correct degree it provides a quenching experience without any harsh alcohol or dry taste, that really satisfies.



The can of course makes a big difference - it's quality."
Greene King / Morland Brewery,Wexford Irish Cream Ale,,,English Bitter,5.00%,nitro-can,2.7,4,2,2,4,4,3/14/2004,"The points for appearance, mouthfeel and drinkability (all 4.0) for this brew are almost always the same for these ""creamy"" nitro-can ales. Unfortunately they are becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish between, and are becomingly increasingly bland - Wexford Cream Ale was no exception.
It pours a slightly cloudy pale orange color, but soon clears to give the typical nitro-can, creamy topped, appetizing look. The smoothness of these beers in general makes them highly drinkable (in terms of consuming lots) but the experience is often ""run-of-the-mill"" and uninspiring. The exceptions to rule two of my earliest experiences with nitro-cans which were Boddingtons (which usually imparts more flavor than most) and (in my opinion) the Granddaddy of them all the original draught Guinness Bitter (in the green can). I'm afraid Wexford does very little for me at all.

"Plzensky Prazdroj, a. s.",Pilsner Urquell,,,Czech Pilsener,4.40%,bottle,4,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,3/14/2004,"I like this stuff. It's #1 quality in my opinion is its drinkability. The brew has a sweetness associated with it that makes it a really smooth experience. Chilled to the correct temperature, this is also an incredibly nice drink to quench your thirst.



Mine poured golden, with a nice head that lasted. Very little lacing, and a smooth start. Good, mild hops and malt in just the right combination.



This brew always brings to mind quality."
Stella Artois,Stella Artois,,,Euro Pale Lager,5.00%,on-tap,3.8,4,3,4,4,4,3/13/2004,"I was brought up with Stella being marketed as a ""Premium"" lager and therefore a more expensive lager. They used to run an advertising campaign that described the beer as ""reassurringly expensive"". I always found this mildly offensive, thinking that it was just another marketing ploy to exploit the consumer, but over the years my opinions have changed. I really believe that, on draught at least (I'm not fond of this in the bottle), if looked after properly, this can be an decent brew. Its appearance is usually very nice, and for a lager, it consistently produces a large, full, creamy head. There is a distinct taste to this lager that sets it aside from many other macro's and I consistently enjoy drinking it.



Like almost all beer in the US, it suffers from being served at ridiculously cold temperatures which have a negative effect on the taste, but all in all it's an enjoyable experience."
SweetWater Brewing Company,Sweetwater Exodus Porter,,,American Porter,5.90%,bottle,3.95,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,3/5/2004,"Pours a very deep, dark brown with a very slight smoky aroma. This is a light Porter in my book that has a nice mouthfeel, but lacks the real creaminess I love in my Porter's. The head was creamy and thick but faded very quickly with little or no lacing. I enjoyed this brew but it lacked a certainly depth and complexity compared to some others of the same style. Nevertheless, I would buy it again.

Black Sheep Brewery PLC,Monty Python's Holy Grail Ale,,,English Pale Ale,4.70%,bottle,3.58,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,3/2/2004,"Poured an orange color with a huge, foamy head. The foaminess of the head was such that, combined with the somewhat ""thin"" pale ale taste, the experience was somewhat ""soapy"". The ale itself was a little on the dry side for me, and although a fairly authentic English Ale experience, not one of my particular favorites. It looked good and tasted above average, but the mouthfeel to me was disappointing for this brewery and style."

In fact very heavily sugared coffee. It poured a very dark, chocolate brown color with an initial sweet coffee taste. The mouthfeel is very smooth, almost syrup-like. It poured with a very light, small tan head that faded quickly.I don't think I could drink a huge amount of this stuff, but certainly an interesting, local aside."
Coors Brewing Company,Blue Moon Belgian White,,,Witbier,5.40%,bottle,3.45,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,2/24/2004,"Pours a very cloudy yellow color with very little head. Frankly I found this very refreshing indeed. Definitely a good thirst quencher. It has a fragrant or floral taste that I thought I would find not to my liking, but does have an unusual quality to it. There are some serious citrus and floral undertones that give this brew a herbal quality.



This is a very acceptable domestic, mass produced substitute for similar, higher quality, more expensive beers of this style and stunning for a Coors product!"

Same, clear glass, 500 mL bottle. Just as magnificent as ever with the great copper colored pour and the lingering biscuit sweet malts. this years offering has little bit more of a bitter bite I think.
A re-visit thanks to SilentSabre, this time a 2005-2006 vintage. The smaller 355 mL bottle as part of the 4 pack. The light, warm buttery biscuit malts are even bigger than I ever remember and the sweetness and the smoothess are even bigger and better than before. Delicious.
2003-2004 Vintage (original review 02/04)
===
Nice example of a typical English bitter product. Sam Smith's is one of my least favorite English brewers but they have produced a really nice beer in the Winter Welcome Ale. This beer has a certain cleanliness and clarity about it. A beautiful amber pour with a really refreshing taste dominated by a hoppy start, fading to a more mild malty overtone, going back to a bitter finish. I thought this was quite complex in taste and enjoyed the different experiences I got as I got down through the bottle.
Nice lingering head with lacing too.
The English bitter flavor was complimented in an unusual way by the lightness of his beer. Normally I prefer the heavier, darker bitters and the Belgians, but this proved to be refreshing and light without losing the taste and becoming watery. Well done."

Second review under the ""Sea Otter Amber"".
Light, reddish amber with some chill haze. Head fades quickly with not much lace.
STILL the astringent, over the top, West Coast American hops which unbalance the beer. My views on Rogue have changed over the years, and I now find many (if not most) of their beers, unbalanced in terms of hops. This is a classic example of that.
Original Review 02/04:
Nice hoppy aroma and initial flavor that mellows out as the bottle is emptied. It poured with a very tight creamy head that left some lacing. I was impressed with the color, a deep reddish brown. In fact the color and dryness of the beer reminded me much more of a red than I was expecting. The hops are initially quite strong in the mouth, but quickly fade to a more pleasing milder taste.
A fairly strong, bitter aftertaste that was a little over-powering for my taste, but still gives this brew a feel of a ""proper"" beer. Another example of the brewing art from this consistent brewery."

In fact, this French lager is not what I call a bitter at all. It's simply a slightly above average European lager to me. Very reminiscent of Kronenbourg 1664 or Grolsch itself (which isn't a bad thing) but far too similar to those (and countless others) to stand out.



A very light, large airy head with some lacing. A pale orange color with a distinct ""bitterness"" for a lager. Like many of these type of drinkable French brews this one also exhibits a fairly metallic bitter aftertaste that was a little harsh for my liking.



Not bad for its type, but not much to report either."

A very clean taste, that I found very refreshing. Particularly noticeable was the distinct and persistent aftertaste that was hoppy with a nice bitter twang. A little cloudy on standing that made the brew a little less attractive than I would otherwise have liked. A simple, drinkable beer that I would be happy to recommend as unremarkable but quite acceptable."

Presented in a Brown Bottle with a best before date of 07/21/04. Poured a deep reddish/brown color with a very light, frothy head that was persistant. The head had a cream color. The carbonation seemed to be excessive at first but didn't drink that way. No excessive gas, a good ""chewable"" head.



This brew is an excellent example of a light, dry stout. The lack of heaviness led to me giving it a 5 on the drinkability score. I really liked this mainly becuse it gave a nice light ""hoppiness"" and a light bitterness on the aftertaste that can sometimes be overwhelming in other stouts.



The addition of the the Ruby Port had a distinct affect on the color but not on the taste.

Jet black and pours with a beautiful frothy, thick head. The head is almost a strawberry blond in color and is persistent. The overall aroma is sweet, with the predominant taste being sweet maltiness. There is very little bitterness. A really creamy, full mouthfeel and mild aftertaste completes the experience. The sweetness is definitely the major factor here.



Not a brutal stout like some can be, but a gentle, caressing brew that many will love."
Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,Sierra Nevada Porter,,,American Porter,5.60%,bottle,3.78,3.5,4,4,3,3.5,2/7/2004,"$7.29 Six Pack Arbor Place Beverage, Douglasville, GA



Very nice. Poured a dark chocolate color with a very small head that disappeared quickly. Some lacing. The fact this is in the Porter style is very much on its side, and this counteracts what I found to be a fairly acidic aroma and initial taste. Once you have consumed about half a bottle the aftertaste becomes quite smooth - in the Porter style. A little thin in the mouth for my taste but nevertheless a good brew."

I rarely expect much from Milds, but was pleasantly surprised by this being as drinkable as it was. A nice blackish color with a large, fast receeding head. It was a little too carbonated for my liking but that seemed to fade fast.



A nice level of bitterness, but generally unremarkable. Slightly above average on my scale."

It poured like liquid mud! Tan head. The chocolate character did two things for me. Firstly it took away the bitterness of the stout and secondly it made the aftertaste somewhat dry.



Given that stouts are not my favorite style, I enjoyed it, but not as much as some others seem to have. Real stout lovers would certainly write better reviews."

Pours a pale orange color with a somewhat transparent look. The head works very well in the nitro can, being produced consistently and instantly. It remains in the glass all the way to the bottom of the beer and even persists after the beer has been consumed as a layer at the bottom of the glass. The brew itself, whilst average in most respects, is incredibly drinkable. A creamy experience, with a bitter aftertaste are the highlights. Very, very smooth."

When hunting around the USA for just about drinkable macros, this would be one that I would pick up simply becasue it was the most drinkable and tasty of a terrible selection. In the bottles served at room temperature, I used to think that I was drinking something half decent.



On draught this is/was served at Arctic temperature meaning that any possible macro credit it would/should receive was lost. This represents a very good example of how chilling beer to this degree makes all taste, character and distinction 100% numb.

355 mL bottle as single as a gift from Penney - many thanks. Sherry aromas are still present for me (after all these years).
Simple beer, remains smooth and tasty. I like a little more cream in my Porters but still a classic standard, especially when you consider what I can reasonably get in the USA.

A sherry/sweet coffee aroma came before a fast fading ""reddish"" head. The head left the beer quickly with very little lacing and no creamy layers.

An amber pour with a really frothy head leaving some excellent lacing. A really refreshing, light ""ale"" taste, but still flavorful.

Malts upfront with a very light bitterness and not nearly as dry as I was expecting. Highly drinkable and somewhat refreshing. Definitely a watery mouthfeel, and lack of body.
Finishes with a little hop dryness, but remarkably balanced for a Rogue beer, since in general I find their beers to be over-hopped in many cases."

I love this bottle, it looks like there is medicine inside, and frankly I felt better after I had consumed the contents!
It poured a beautiful chocolate brown with a dense, creamy head that fades to a very attractive spotty, creamy thin layer for the remainder of the glass. This beer is complex and smooth with an exceptional mouthfeel. I think it gives the perfect combination of stout creaminess and ale taste. The heaviness of stout is missing, but it still provides the smoothness associated with some of the best stouts.
I see from a number of other reviews the many BA's don't consider this brew heavy enough to be called a ""proper"" Porter. That may well be the case, but nevertheless this is a magnificent drink. I guess I'm not really a ""proper"" Porter fan, more of a fan of ""pseudo"" Porters, but this brew struck the exact right balance of ale and stout for me. Delicious!"
Wychwood Brewery Company Ltd,Hobgoblin,,,English Brown Ale,5.20%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,1/25/2004,"Nice. Poured a caramel red color with a large foamy head that subsided quickly. Lots of lacing. This is what I would call a full flavored English Ale and nice to see it in the clear bottle. I always associate these bottles with real ale that I've usually drunk on draught before trying it in the bottle (e.g. Old Speckled hen). The bottle gives it an authentic ""Ale"" feel. I think this would satisfy somebody looking for a tasty beer but who was still looking for something that wasn't too heavy. A refreshing experience with a very hoppy finish. Would certainly pick this up again."

I'm not a huge fan of the Hefe-Weizen's in general, but this is clearly a quality beer. Very smooth in the mouth and highly drinkable. There was a distinct fruitness in the aroma that was not evident in the taste. Like almost all of this style of beer very thirst-quenching. I can't help but associate the Hefe's with summer drinking so I always encourage the consumption of these in the warmer months - I don't know why, but they always seem to go down easier then."

I'm not a huge fan of stout in general, and as a result my scores may be a little on the low side.



Regardless of that this is one hell of an impressive looking beer. As black as any I can remember, with a truly brown head. The mild bitterness that this gives, truly coats the roof of the mouth for an unmistakable stout experience. The after-taste was much more mellow. The whole experience was one I enjoyed, but if stout is not your bag it should remain an occasional, rather than a regular tipple.



Drinkability is high because there is a lack of bitterness and although this isn't one, it drinks like a milk or sweet stout.

A cloudy orange/copper appearance with a good head that faded quickly. Just the right amount of carbonation for me (very little). Very clean bitterness with almost no chemical aftertaste like so many American beers. All in all very enjoyable - a nice drink. Would reccomend it to bitter drinkers and real beer lovers as a decent, substitute for the real stuff. The fact that it looks like real beer as opposed to urine helps, and has flavor and isn't fizzier than ginger ale is also on its side. Good work Dogwood."

Poured with a large frothy head that disappeared instantly to reveal a lemon colored solution. The overwhelming experience of taste, aroma and aftertaste is alcohol. I found it very difficult to distinguish anything else. I don't feel that this particular mass-produced North American lager is any worse than any other, they all are instantly forgetable. Of course we all have our own favorites and styles, but I simply can't imagine getting any joy from this weak offering.

I enjoyed this beer, but I suspect that may have been simply because after over exposure to Miller Lite, Bud, Rolling Rock etc. one tends to relish even the most ordinary of tastier microbrew styles.



Good light brown head and a decent enough head (that nevertheless faded very quickly) was followed by a slightly dry and slightly thin experience. Balanced and simple caramel malts and light fruity/floral hops but not much to distinguish it from many others. Dryish finish. A simple beer that is refreshing if somewhat non-descript.



Not my favorite of all time, but one I would certainly go for again ahead of all mass produced lagers."

A nice amber color with a head (that really reveals what appears to be an awful lot of carbonation) that disappears very quickly. The first few mouthfuls were very ordinary but by the time I got to the third (cooler) bottle it seemed to get better. A mild taste with a distinct lack of bitterness or hops is not really to my liking, but nevertheless a very drinkable beer. Wouldn't be in a rush to go for this again, but wouldn't specifically avoid it either."
Spoetzl Brewery,Shiner Bock,,,Bock,4.40%,bottle,2.75,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.5,1/10/2004,"Frankly I was disappointed. The darker the better for me, and this promised much (from what I'd heard) but came in as a bit of a lightweight. I found the experience a little ""tinny"" and fairly acidic. It did look good, and certainly would be a good candidate for a prolonged session, but too carbonated, light and watery for my taste. I thought it was too much like a decent dark beer that had been slightly diluted by accident."
Bières de Chimay (Abbaye Notre Dame de Scourmont),Chimay Grande Réserve (Blue),,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,9.00%,bottle,4.43,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,1/7/2004,"Spectacular style and most importantly spectacular experience. This brew exudes quality in every respect.



Surprisingly, a highly carbonated pour with really quite a fizzy initial appearance. Murky brown color in the body. Dubbel appearance.



Belgian yeasts are apparent in the nose with some fruits but they are difficult to distinguish specifically.



Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side for the style and there are many better in the mouth than this one.



Great trailblazer for Belgian beers outside of the continent, and its contribution will never be forgotten (at least by me), but this beer seems a little dated. Don't get me wrong, this is still a classic but with an ever increasing array of wonderful Belgians and Belgian styles in the marketplace, Chimay seems to have lost its edge a little."
Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,30th Anniversary - Jack & Ken's Ale,,,American Barleywine,10.20%,bottle,3.15,4,3.5,3,3,3,4/21/2011,"OK, a 'Black Barleywine' brewed by an American brewery is frankly unlikely to be a beer that I fall in love with, so for that reason I decided to sit on this one for a while. I've had it since it first came to Georgia, so a decent amount of time on it now. Opening corked & caged affair gives a pretty alarming pop with some good gun smoke. A really dark chestnut colored pour that reminds me of the most mature conkers that I had as a kid. A thin, creamy film/cap forms on the beer as things settle down and some mocha like lace attaches self to the inside of the Brasserie de l'Abbaye des Rocs goblet. A somewhat bready, chocolately nose that has a grain character as well. The grain/cereal notes are carried forward to the taste. the beer drinks with a dry bitterness that one would expect from the style, and finishes a little burned. The grainy notes are surprisingly evident and there's a strange build up of warming alcohol at the end of the beer. The beers a little thin and lacks presence for me. Not an entirely aggressive beer by the standards often set by the style, but nevertheless it still offers the rough edges and lack of refinement that is commonplace in this style."
Brewery Ommegang,Gnomegang,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,9.50%,bottle,4.55,4.5,5,4.5,4,4.5,4/22/2011,"750 mL, corked & caged in the usual Ommegang bottle. Pop on opening is modest, with a little gun smoke. Pour is a beautiful golden clarity, with a smallish head. Lace is present but not tremendous. Considering the ABV all is in order, and the color is truly pretty to behold. Carbonation seems somewhat restrained but again, quite appropriate. The nose is an absolute treat. A huge estery, lightly phenolic pineapple barrage that does not let up. The tastes follow that lead with plenty of sugar coated, pineapple-cube candy and have decent levels of all of the elements one needs in a beer like this - white pepper, Belgian yeast notes, a little more candied sugar, some alcohol and a touch of earthiness in the back end. The alcohol is certainly present and dallied a little with a solvent edge but always manages to step back at the last second. Peppery bitterness cuts in in the finish and back-end of the beer to add to my satisfaction. As it warms the beer seems creamier, and the sweetness builds to give even more Tripel like character. The kind of beer that Ommegang makes incredibly well, and the inspiration that they take from Belgium is easy to see."
Sand Creek Brewing Company,Special Reserve Wisconsin Scottish Ale,,,Scottish Ale,?,bottle,3.93,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4/23/2011,"As others have mentioned, there is no mention of ""Special Reserve"" on the label here, so I am assuming this is the correct beer. 12 oz bottle, thanks go out to Kevin for the chance to try this beer.

Mid-amber pour with a nice clarity. Head is reserved, but appropriate.

The nose is really rather strong with plenty of sherry liquor notes which get me rather excited.The aroma promises a richness.

The taste don't really match the virility of the aroma. There is certainly a huge malty, sweet, bread-like presence, and a dash of the sherry note among the alcohol, but not in a manner that the aroma initially suggested.

A nice rounded mouthfeel, tasty malts and a dash of sherry. No peat or smokiness to speak of here, but nonetheless a tasty offering."
George Bateman and Son Ltd. / Batemans Brewery,Rosey Nosey,,,Winter Warmer,5.00%,bottle,4.43,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4/28/2011,"Lighter than expected amber color with a head and lace combo which is sufficient to keep me happily engaged. Medium (appropriate) carbonation. The nose is where the special nature of this beer start to manifest themselves. Rich caramel, biscuit malts combine to reveal a classic, English malt and mid-hop character brew. Slight dry finish that one would expect completes the package with a touch of soapy bitterness in the aftertaste. Don't think of this as a Winter Warmer and you'll be happier. This feels much more like a classic English ESB than just about anything else, and it delivers thecomplex malts of a gret British pint with ease. Really tasty, a beer that showcases the malt spectrum beautifully well."
Mikkeller,Rauch Geek Breakfast / Beer Geek Bacon,,,American Double / Imperial Stout,7.50%,bottle,2.93,4,3.5,2.5,3,3,4/28/2011,"Jet black pour with a really dark, coffee colored head. Nose and tastes deliver a large amount of smoke, but the beer lacks the meaty, solid quality of many smoked beers and in that respect feels a little light. Tobacco feautes with some leathery components, but the beer lacks a sweet edge that really needs to accompany the smoked malts. Slightly too bitter for me and this beer frankly lacks the charm and subtelty of many other smoked beers. Frankly i was disappointed. Not up to speed for me."

21st Amendment Brewery,Bitter American,,,American Pale Ale (APA),4.4%,can,3.58,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,3/25/11,"OK, let's be clear, at 4.4% this is NOT a session beer. Right, now we've got that out of the way, back to the beer itself.
12 oz can, many thanks go out to Beejay for the chance to try this one.
Pour is a deep gold color with a pretty spectacular head (if somewhat light), but the lace is very good. Nice retention.
The carbonation seems a touch on the high side.
VERY strong hoppy aroma which is frankly a bit surprising. 
The hops threaten a bit at the start of the beer but never really amount to the threat of the burst that came in the nose when the ring-pull was first broken. There's a light, floral touch about the beer but the carbonation is not in check enough to make the beer really reach its potential. Prickly feel is a bit annoying to me and take away from the overall experience.
Pretty tasty, but I'd enjoy a little more malt presence to back up the green hops, and of course the use of the word 'session' on the can is simply factually inaccurate, but it's still a tasty beer."
21st Amendment Brewery,Monk's Blood,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,8.3%,can,3.05,3,3,3,3.5,3,3/24/11,"12 oz single can from Mac's, Midtown, Atlanta, GA, USA as part of their new ""Pick/Mix a Four pack"" as opposed to the pick/mix a 6 pack.
The beer pours a hazed, reddish-copper color with some cream colored head that does not linger. Not much lace.
Nose gives up a little maltiness but to be honest it really is nothing to crow about. Some sweetness and a dash of alcohol but not much else, even on warming.
Tastes are pretty sweet which is OK for the style, but follows up with some significant bubble-gum that is a little grating. There is quite a lot of ester character with pineapple definitely in there, but the beer never really delivers that specific, Belgian yeast elements that I'm looking for. Alcohol is a touch solventy for me too.
I dunno I was expecting more I guess, as a beer I had heard a lot about and in one of my favorite style ought to excite me more than this did. I found it sweeter than it should be with not much subtlety or interest."
21st Amendment Brewery,Fireside Chat,,,Winter Warmer,7.9%,can,1.83,3,2.5,1.5,3,1,3/11/11,"$1.65 for the 12 oz can from Green's on Buford Highway, Atlanta, GA, USA.
A reddish, thin looking body with some brown highlights at the extremities.
The head is richer than the body and leaves some nice, dense lace.
The beer has very little hint of being a Winter Warmer and frankly no winter spice element that I can detect. It drinks like a thin, acidic, slightly off brown ale that may be on the brink of developing a large infection. Some slight lacto elements, the beer is pretty poor under any guise, and a tragic Winter Warmer.
Too light in the mouth and a nasty acidic aftertaste pull the shambolic 'beer' together.
It's bad - period."
21st Amendment Brewery,Hop Crisis,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,11.8%,on-tap,4.35,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,10/15/10,"11 oz pour at Deckard's. Their menu says 10.8% (new vintage with a different ABV perhaps?).
Golden hazed body with relatively low carbonation. Bone white head that is small but well retained and tight. Lace is very pretty.
West Coast Pine resin nose.
Tastes are simply not as aggressive as the nose might suggest. Relatively subdued for the style, the nose and the ABV. Plenty of lightly warming alcohol and some lovely, peach/grapefruit sting in the middle and back end. Lingering aniseed in the aftertaste.
This was less in your face than I was expecting, but for me that was a good thing. All the West Coast elements of the style are here, but in a sensible, relatively restrained manner. Good stuff, a beer that I savored."
A1A Aleworks,Porpoise Point Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),5.4%,on-tap,2.93,3.5,2.5,3,3,3,1/2/11,"Decent looking pour with a golden body sitting underneath a small, white cap of foam.
Despite the small head, the carbonation seems quite aggressive and vigorous and a little prickly. Not much aroma, even after it warms. This beer clearly doesn't have a lot of volatiles present.
Semi-sweet grains with perhaps a touch of zesty fruit, but in no way is this beer either bitter or particularly tasty. Lacks much depth, but at least it is non-offensive. I found it refreshing and drinkable, but the beer doesn't really stand out in any way.
It's the kind of beer that I would be absolutely delighted to be able to produce in my garage, but at the same time also pretty disappointed if I couldn't! What I mean by that is that the beer doesn't have any flaws as such, but is truly a pretty mediocre effort for a professional outfit."
A1A Aleworks,Winter's Nip Bock,,,Bock,?,on-tap,3.53,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,1/1/11,"Drank at the brewpub on 12/28/2010.
Comes with a nicely capped white head, some lace all sitting above a decently colored, garnet/brown, clear body.
The beer drinks true to style with some clean edges and a nice, malty base. Typical Gordon Biersch simplicity with their German based lagers.
The mouthfeel was pretty light and made for some simple, easy drinking,
Tasty beer."
Anderson Valley Brewing Company,Poleeko Gold Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),5.5%,can,3.45,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,8/7/10,"12 oz can - $2.10 from Ned's in Lynchburg, VA, USA. Attractive simplicity to the can design with a slightly retro feel. I like it.
Nice pour, with a golden body and a fluffy, light, non-dense head.
An interesting beer to me since the upfront tastes seems to suggest some English influence (with some biscuit-like malts and some sweetness), but finishes with a decent amount of aggressive bitterness. Somewhat contradictory.
Some decent oily bitterness in the finish that manifest itself in an ""American"" manner.
Tasty and drinkable, another one of the growing legion of drinkable cans that can serve on multi-purpose trips to places where glass is not appropriate."
Baird Brewing Company / Fishmarket Taproom,Jubilation Ale,,,Winter Warmer,7.0%,on-tap,4.08,3,3.5,4.5,4,4,12/22/10,"22 oz bottle, $10.99 from Arbor Place Beverage, Douglasville, GA, USA.
Pour is a murky brown body with average head and lace. Not that enamored with the color or the appearance and it has me a little unhappy.
On to the nose and taste. It actually drinks in a much cleaner than the color and bod would suggest. The light fruit touch and the cleanliness are traits that I have (happily) begun to associate with Baird, and they are attributes that I enjoy. the nose has a lightly spiced alcohol note, neither of which are truly enforced in the taste. The tastes impart a fruit note (which I suppose are the figs) but frankly could be an orange, citrus based flavor as well. The cinnamon is really muted, and again could really be any, light, winter spice. Frankly it tastes better than it smells and a LOT better than it looks.
Pretty simple, Winter Warmer type of beer, and one that you would probably enjoy if you like the spice note to be a little more muted and less aggressive. Emphasis here is on a light fruit angle, which as I say above, seems to be angle that Baird takes quite a bit and one which I enjoy.
Not a classic Winter Warmer, but a lighter, fruitier version. One downside is the $10.99 price tag. Just a little too expensive to make it good value, although the beer itself is very nice."
Belhaven Brewery Company Ltd.,Belhaven Scottish Ale,,,Scottish Ale,5.2%,nitro-tap,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,11/21/04,"Much darker than the majority of the nitro tap ""bitters"" that I have experienced, and a little better than those others too.



The first thing that hit me was a smokiness in the aroma. This is one of the few nitro-taps that I feel maintained some of the dark bitterness that the original brew should have, and still managed to combine it with the inherent smooth, silkiness of the nitro presentation. Unlike many others, it still felt as though it had some authenticity to a non-nitro alternative.



Very nice mouthfeel, good bitterness and a satisfying drink. Extremely drinkable."
"Bell's Brewery, Inc.",Bell's Christmas Ale,,,Scottish Ale,5.4%,on-tap,3.68,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,11/7/10,"11 oz pour @ Taco Mac, East West Connector, Austell, GA, USA.
Firstly, $6.25 for the pour!! Discussed here;
http://beeradvocate.com/forum/read/3168840
Pour is an amber color with some nice clarity, good head and some nice lace. Looks tidy in the glass.
Nose gives a few notes of toffee and caramel and the tastes reflect that. The beer has a few nutty elements and is obviously and definitely malt based, but as for being a Scotch Ale I just don't get it! If you are looking for some of those classic notes, then I think you will be horribly disappointed. If you are looking for a nice, simple, wintertime beer with some good levels of malt and a generally, sweet, malt based taste profile then you may well enjoy this beer. Don't look for classic Scotch Ale notes.
The price is a whole other issue, and this may be a Taco Mac problem rather than a Bell's problem, but at $9+ a pint this is one of the worst value drinks I recall EVERY buying."
Boddingtons,Boddingtons Pub Ale,,,English Pale Ale,4.70%,nitro-can,3.45,3.5,3,3.5,3,4,2/1/04,"$7.09 for 4 pack Publix supermarket, Carrollton, GA.
Pours a pale orange color with a somewhat transparent look. The head works very well in the nitro can, being produced consistently and instantly. It remains in the glass all the way to the bottom of the beer and even persists after the beer has been consumed as a layer at the bottom of the glass. The brew itself, whilst average in most respects, is incredibly drinkable. A creamy experience, with a bitter aftertaste are the highlights. Very, very smooth."
BrewDog,Bashah,,,American Black Ale,8.6%,bottle,3.08,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,4/10/11,"12 oz bottle.
Batch 352 which I think says 12/19/10 as the bottled on date, but I bought this way before that so that cannot be correct. My suspicion is that is a best before date. Anyway...
Black pour with some brownish highlights. Not much head, very little lace, but it settles to give a spotty, creamy film on the surface.
Nose offers plenty of hop character, and it is typically aggressive for the style and the two breweries involved. 
That carries forward to the taste where the hops could be described as medicinal. It's not so much a question of bitterness, but there is a distinct flavor of herbal charcoal note.
There is a creamy element to the beer which suggests a hoppy stout rather than something lighter.
Not bad, but not a beer or style that I ever likely to fall in love with."
Brooklyn Brewery,Brooklyn Buzz Bomb Ale,,,Braggot,8.0%,on-tap,3.68,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,10/11/10,"On tap at Taco Mac Metropolis, Atlanta, GA, USA. Arrived at TM on a Sunday knowing that this beer had been tapped a few hours earlier. Asking my waitress if it was still on she said ""no"" and suggested the ""similar"", Brooklyn Pennant Ale! Good grief ::faceplam::. Anyway, I decided to investigate this myself by going to the bar - it was STILL pouring. Ho hum.
From notes.
A hazed, orange pour with a decent head and some lace. The lace is well formed and is nice and sticky.
Nose and tastes are rather wheat based which seems unusual for the style. Sweet elements from the beer which, given the style, I suppose is to be expected. The beer drinks very easily although the tastes are a little tiring (I couldn't see myself drinking much of this).
The beer has a slick mouthfeel which does make it easy to consume, but at the same time it makes it a beer that fills your palate and stomach quickly.
Interesting beer than seems like a sweet, wheat ale to me. Not quite as sweet as other Braggot's I've had but it is still a feature of this beer."
Butternuts Beer And Ale,Moo Thunder Stout,,,Milk / Sweet Stout,4.9%,can,4,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,10/5/10,"Delighted and impressed by another one of the offerings from Butternuts.
12 oz single can from Hop City, Atlanta, GA.
Pours a decent black color with a smallish head that fades quickly.
This is a simple milk stout that delivers a decent amount of acidity in the tastes. Light roast that is pretty delicate, competes with some sweet notes that play off one another nicely. Carbonation is low but perfect for the style, delivering a light beer that does NOT feel thin at all.
The light acidity is repeated in several areas and comes with a final flourish in the back end.
Smooth and very drinkable.
Very satisfying for such a simple beer, and in the beers' simplicity lies both its integrity and its most pleasing aspects."
Capital Brewery,Supper Club Lager,,,American Pale Lager,5.0%,can,2.1,2,2,2,3,2,4/8/11,"12 oz metallic looking can. Thanks go out to Kevin for the chance to have a crack at this one.
Any wispy head that was there on the initial pour dies really quickly above a fizzy looking, golden colored body. Pretty poor looking.
No apparent nose, even on warming.
Tastes are the usual combo of vegetal sweetness, high carbonation and a malty blandness that is distinctive only in relation to its non-descript nature.
Not really much here that is too offensive, however it really only says macro swill, so...there you have it."
Carlsberg-Tetley Brewing Ltd,Tetley's English Ale,,,English Pale Ale,3.60%,nitro-can,2.88,4,2.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,6/12/04,"$5.99, four-pack, Corks, Marietta/Smyrna, GA.
It looks good and you can drink a lot of this stuff, but the nitro cans (smoothflow) are simply a pale shadow of real Tetley's. I am biased, because after you drunk the real stuff only yards from the brewery in Leeds pubs, you are unlikely to be impressed by a nitro-can clone.
It's such a shame that a great beer and a great brewery feels the commercial pressure to go down this route to produce beers that are simply inferior to their roots. Quite sad really.
WE ARE LEEDS, marching on together!"
Central City Brewing,Red Racer IPA,,,American IPA,6.5%,can,3.95,4,4,4,3.5,4,12/24/10,"Thanks go out to finewinemike for this beer as part of my Secret Santa package for 2010. 
A Canadian born IPA in can, quite the novelty! 
The pour produces a slightly hazed, orange body with lots of white head and some super, sticky lace - always a good sign.
Nose and tastes deliver some very fresh, clean light grapefruit notes, but it's never really aggressive. Finish IS on the dry side of things, but again lacks the puckering aggression that can sometimes come with the style.
Clean, lightly metallic American IPA which will please."
Cigar City Brewing,Capricho Oscuro - Batch 2,,,American Strong Ale,?,bottle,4.08,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,4/3/11,"12 oz bottle, many thanks go out to Steve for the chance to try this one.
On the neck label the Batch # (2), and the bottle count (205/450) are noted.
Pour is a dark, chestnut brown with quite a lot of sediment, a lovely rich, coffee colored head, some which brings with it some decent retention and lace.
Big 'ole which malty notes with some sherry and alcohol. 
Tastes reflect that, but come in with a bit more subtlety. The sherry and alcohol notes are reflected early, but then we get more chocolate character.
Body is a touch thinner than the style and the nose would suggest, but the shortcomings are not significant and still delivers a smooth feeling.
Interesting. A beer that seems to sit closer to a coffee-based, chocolaty porter or stout than an American Strong. Definitely low hop character for the style, and the mouthfeel doesn't match.
Interesting beer."
Cigar City Brewing,Jai Alai IPA - Papaya,,,American IPA,7.5%,bottle,3.83,5,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,3/26/11,"750 mL bottle as part of a care package from Joey at the brewery. Many thanks.
Nothing on the label to suggest that this beer has Jai Alai as the base, but reading the reviews it apparently does.
The label is attractive and it suggests a fruity, rich experience is in store - that doesn't really happen for me.
Pour is a VERY attractive deep copper color with a high, fluffy head. The color is very rich and reminds me of one of those high def photographs that has that orange hue. The beer looks rich.
The aroma is also VERY strong. As soon as the cap is popped the beer starts to exude that pine notes associated with Jai Alai.
Unfortunately there is a fairly strong solvent alcohol taste that comes with the beer which to be honest, overwhelms any fruit character for me. I get VERY little fruit here at all, and it feels largely like a pretty standard, aggressive American IPA. Lots of bitter metallic notes which is OK, but it still leaves me craving a tropical fruit splash.
This is one pretty beer, and it's OK, but I would have LOVED a whole bunch of luscious fruit to come through in the taste; it just doesn't so in that respect a bit of a miss. Perhaps the label misled me a bit, and I felt slightly disappointed."
Cigar City Brewing,El Lector,,,English Dark Mild Ale,4.0%,growler,3.63,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3/25/11,"32 oz growler courtesy of Joey as part of a care package from the brewery.
Beer pours a very cloudy, chocolate brown color with a very, very modest head. Lace is minimal. In stronger light the beer takes on more orange hues. Does look especially attractive, but having said that a great Mild is seldom a stunning looker, so there is a degree of authenticity about that!
Nose is a very nutty affair - noticeably so in fact. Surprising. If this were a blind taste taste I would guess that this was a brown ale with nut character of some description. As the beer warms, the nutty character seems to morph into a yeast and nut combo.
The beer does not replicate the nutty character of the nose which frankly is a good thing, but is does leave a little residual in the back end.
The beer is simply balanced with a pleasing drinkability that goes down easily, but it seems a long way removed from an English Dark Mild to me. No sweat, I'm just delighted to get the chance to drink a well balanced, tasty beer that comes in at session strength - it is LITERALLY difficult to be able to do that these days in the US. For this, I am grateful, cheers CCB."
Cigar City Brewing,Jai Alai IPA,,,American IPA,7.5%,on-tap,4.55,4,4.5,5,4,4,11/20/10,"===
Original Review 11/10
===
Drunk on numerous occasions on a recent trip to Jacksonville, FL, USA. This review is taken from one of the draft servings.
High head sits a top the amber body and leaves some superb, sticky lace.
The aroma and tastes match one another in as much as the beer gives a high fruit element amongst the hops. This is a fruity tasting IPA indeed, BUT it in no way skimps on the hop profile either. It's pretty unusual in the way in manages to combine the two elements that can be competing factors. Light grapefruit, and then a few more tropical, sweeter, softer edges to the fruit.
It's a beer that is somewhat of a paradox. It DOES have the signature aggression in the hop profile for an American IPA, but at the same time it also gives a gentle, softer sweet fruit note that I really enjoy.
It's a REALLY tasty beer but the ABV creeps up on me a bit and I really can't consume much more than 12 oz at a time. the drinkability is good because of the taste, but it's not a beer that can be consumed in any type of quantity."
Cisco Brewers Inc.,Whale's Tale Pale Ale,,,English Pale Ale,5.6%,can,3.93,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,8/6/10,"12 oz can from CBX, Charleston, SC, USA. $1.99.
Beautiful light copper pour with superb clarity and a nice head and decent carbonation. Despite the glass being impeccably clean, the head is not retained well and there is no lace.
Clean malts and a light alcohol touch in the nose.
Tastes continue the clean feel with sharp malts giving way to some middle sweetness and then a dash of hops in the ending.
The aftertaste gives a pleasing and satisfying biscuit malt feel that is reminiscent of an English Pale Ale.
Very tasty and pleasing, an APA that isn't really an APA at all - more depth of character, and a beer that reminds me somewhat of an English style brew. Interesting.
Cans are a bonus and I could see this doing a job in many outdoor circumstances."
COAST Brewing Company,Boy King Double IPA,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,9.5%,growler,4.33,4.5,5,4,4,4.5,4/10/10,"OK, here we go with the much vaunted Boy King from COAST. I got really lucky as my wife was in Hilton Head when the Boy King was tapped at The Lodge - one growler = $19.
Growler opens with a pleasing ""phhssst"" which gives me confidence - you never know how well the growler was filled or how it will hold up over a couple of days. This one seems perfect.
The nose up front is really quite strong with a hop-laden tangerine citrus coming to the fore. The aroma is pretty interesting because as the beer warms a little the fruit intensifies but the smell seems to become increasingly malty and less hop-dominant.
A hazed and clouded amber/orange with degrees of color down the tapered glass, the beer has an Olde English Marmalade look about it in terms of hue. Head is light but full, leaves excellent lace, and has nice retention but is less ""sticky"" that some DIPA froths.
EXTREMELY well balanced with a malt presence and backbone which MUST be one of the largest ever encountered in an American DIPA. Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of west coast style resin and pine in the middle and back-end of the beer, but the start is very, very malty for the style and this rounds out the aftertaste too - very unusual and subtle aftertaste for something in this style. Mild bitterness but not palate wrenching. There's even a touch of unsweetened bubblegum in there!
Extremely drinkable, and although I wouldn't say that the alcohol is nowhere to be seen, I would say that it is quite subtle and very understated in terms of the taste. It does not manifest itself in the 9.5% range! As a result, take care, this beer could clearly sneak up on you and bite you pretty hard.
I score this beer pretty highly, BUT this is really interesting because if you are a SERIOUS hop-head I don't think that this will quite cut it for you. In that respect it's an interesting DIPA and a beer that will appeal to those of us that like a hop blast but still demand balance. Some American drinkers shun such balance so, in time, we should get some mixed reviews on this one. I'll be watching with interest."
Coors Brewing Company,Blue Moon Pale Moon,,,Belgian Pale Ale,5.4%,on-tap,3.7,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,1/15/11,"On draught at Buffalo Wild Wings, Douglasville, GA, USA.
Orange body with a small head and some sticky lace. Slight haze to the body.
Quite a surprising green/ fresh hop note in the nose. Agitating the beer produces even more of the same - wasn't expecting that!
No Belgian yeast character to speak of. The beer is quite 'snappy' with some really clean lines and some fairly well defined fruit notes. Light zing in the finish and a crisp drink.
Not bad at all. A simple beer which is a plus for me, a sensible (if not exactly low) ABV, combine to produce a tasty, balanced beer that is very drinkable. Light touch with some malt presence too.
Good beer, ""as a beer"" if NOT as an example of the style - in that respect it's poor."
Cotleigh Brewery,Golden Seahawk,,,English Bitter,4.2%,cask,3.88,3.5,4,4,3,4,8/30/08,"Another classic English bitter if not quite a classic in its own right. Cask offering at The Well House, Cathedral Yard, Exeter, Devon, England. Summer 2007 from notes. This was offered at the end of the Real Ale Festival at the pub the week before.
Very Pale, golden color almost yellow. Subtle flavors with honey sweet notes and a typical biscuit malt and Goldings combination (not sure if Goldings are used in this but it seems that way to me). Light, bitter aftertaste and finish. Slight citrus, but its pretty weak.
Simple beer that is tasty but leaves a litle to be desired in the mouthfeeel depart. Somewhat thin."
Country Life Brewery,Golden Pig,,,English Bitter,4.7%,cask,4.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,11/27/08,"From notes:
Interesting brew this, mainly because it has the name and the appearance that would suggest that it is one of the infamous ""Golden Ales"" that have grown up in England over the last few years as dumbed down, traditional English Bitters. HOWEVER, despite the appearance (which is decidedly in the Golden Ale category), this beer drinks as a definite, standard English Bitter to me.
A yellowish appearance with nice, bubbly head and a decent spread of lace, the challenger nose is distinct. The tastes are obviously malt based, but the crystal malt that's in the beer gives it a deceptive look. It drinks a with a greater caramel note than the color would suggest.
Light floral hops complete the package. ""Sessionable""? I suppose (without being a session beer), but approaching 5% there are still plenty of beers with more scope than this on a hot day.
Bit of an odd one - it's a better beer than the name or the appearance would suggest!"
Dave's BrewFarm,BrewFarm Select,,,American Pale Lager,5.5%,can,3.18,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,12/9/10,"12 oz can, many thanks to Kevin for the opportunity to try this one.
Golden, clear, macro-like pour with a decent, fluffy head. Some retention and some attractive lace but otherwise largely unremarkable.
Grainy, buttered toast on the nose with some slight grassy hop aroma - not much at all, even on warming.
Tastes offer an organic-like experience with a clean bill of malts making up the majority of the tastes. Some more light hay and grass but it never really adds up to much. Not much depth here, and I suppose that's OK, but the beer ultimately remains pretty ordinary. ""Sweet"" and ""clean"" are attributes in its favor, but not much else is. Good beer for some outdoor drinking in warmer weather I suppose.
Fine, but ultimately another beer in a unremarkable category."
De Scheldebrouwerij,Hop Ruiter,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,8.0%,bottle,3.7,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,4/7/11,"So I've been eying this 750 mL bottle in the store for some time and assumed (from afar) that it would be a Belgian IPA (considering the name), but was a little surprised to see it in the BA db as simply a BSPA. Additionally it was reviewed in this months BA magazine and was given the moniker 'Belgian Strong Golden Ale'! Seems like the beer has a identity crisis. Either way I'm pretty confident that I know what this beer will taste LIKE, it really depends to what degree that the white pepper, spice notes, alcohol, Belgian yeast/candy and hop character kick-in, before we can assign it its rightful place on that particular sliding scale.

Into the Duvel tulip she goes.

A pretty deep orange gold color on the body with some really lovely head, lace and retention. Beer looks bright and lively.

Nose gives up a little bitterness but not a great deal.

The tastes are a confusing mixture of things for me. what I would call a threatening hop base and a lurking Belgian yeast note but neither really come to the fore with any force. There is also an underlying sweetness that makes me almost think 'tripel' for a second, but then that is snatched away too. There are plenty of surprising floral notes too, which all adds up to a crazy package. I don't dislike it, but at the same time it never really delivers one thing or another. It's not a Belgian IPA, nor is it a really clean BSPA, and in that respect to be honest it disappoints a bit.

In addition I like the alcohol in a beer of this style to bite a little more than it does here. Needs a dash more pepper or solvent bite.

A beer that really doesn't know what it is. Like I say, not unpleasant, but a beer that falls between several stools for me and slightly lets me down. I wanted to like this more. Shame."
Fuller Smith & Turner PLC,Organic Honeydew,,,English Pale Ale,5.0%,bottle,4.03,4.5,4,4,4,4,3/25/11,"500 mL bottle as depicted in the BA database. $3.99 from Green's on Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour is an impressive, bright golden color with some lovely clarity, good carbonation, a nice, tight white head with some good retention and lace. Attractive no doubt with some great depth of orange color in the golden hue. Nice.
The nose offers a little breadiness amongst the sweet malts and a a hint of toasty grains.
Tastes give more of the toasty grain character and a honey elements that is more on the clover and fragrant side of things rather than intensely sweet. A beer that is warm in character and gives subtle hints and notes that will escape many. The bread element never leaves, and this beer is one that is probably best suited to cooler months. Surprisingly hearty, filling and satisfying for a beer with a light touch.
Drinkable? Certainly, but I'd need to be in the mood for this. If I were, this is a beer that I could drink a lot of despite its non-session beer ABV."
Greene King / Morland Brewery,Abbot Ale,,,English Pale Ale,5.00%,nitro-can,3.45,3.5,2.5,3.5,4,4,5/29/04,"Another example of a super keg beer being completely neutralized by putting in a nitro-can. The stuff in the can is virtually unrecognizable in experience to the original, which in this case is a step back. OK - what can you say about these nitro brews? They all pour to give beautiful, perfectly formed pints, they are all super-smooth and they are all really drinkable (like milkshakes), but so what? All the character of the Abbot is lost in this commercialization process. Shame. There is still a little recognizable bitterness that comes through in the aftertaste, but apart from that it's just blandness that rules again."
Greene King / Morland Brewery,Wexford Irish Cream Ale,,,English Bitter,5.00%,nitro-can,2.7,4,2,2,4,4,3/14/04,"The points for appearance, mouthfeel and drinkability (all 4.0) for this brew are almost always the same for these ""creamy"" nitro-can ales. Unfortunately they are becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish between, and are becomingly increasingly bland - Wexford Cream Ale was no exception.
It pours a slightly cloudy pale orange color, but soon clears to give the typical nitro-can, creamy topped, appetizing look. The smoothness of these beers in general makes them highly drinkable (in terms of consuming lots) but the experience is often ""run-of-the-mill"" and uninspiring. The exceptions to rule two of my earliest experiences with nitro-cans which were Boddingtons (which usually imparts more flavor than most) and (in my opinion) the Granddaddy of them all the original draught Guinness Bitter (in the green can).

Guinness Ltd.,Guinness Draught,,,Irish Dry Stout,4.2%,nitro-bottle,3.95,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,5/23/04,"Ahh, Guinness. Probably the single most varied experience depending on location and serving type out of any beer worldwide. And that's the problem with this stuff - the search for consistency.



In this particular case (the ""draught"" nitro bottle) we are treated to something that looks like ""draught"" Guinness but that's about where the similarities end. This stuff has a watered down smoothness and is consequently less heavy the ""draught"". It means that the taste, mouthfeel and general experience are not comparable to real draught, but it does make this stuff incredibly drinkable in significant quantities! What I've always liked about Guinness, is that for a stout, it is light. I like the relative blandness and drinkability that I find more challenging in some of the heavier stouts. Certainly less flavor, but easier to consume in quantity."
Hamm's Brewing Co.,Hamm's,,,American Adjunct Lager,?,can,2.18,3.5,2,2,3,2,2/5/11,"12 oz can, many thanks go out to Kevin for the chance to try this one.
Can and the brand make this look like a real retro beer - America in the 50's and 60's is the feel I get from it.
Pour is a very pale golden hue with a large, frothy head. The head has some decent retention and lace, and doesn't look bad a tall. To be honest, I did pour it in a very aggressive manner.
Nose and tastes are largely devoid of any character with a slight, sweet grain note and perhaps a little crisp citrus.
To be honest, as the beer warms it becomes increasingly water-like and the beer begins to lose its nostalgic charm.
Thought it may have been better than it was, but in the end it turned out to be just another dreadful, American, non-descript adjunct lager."
Harpoon Brewery,Harpoon Chocolate Stout,,,American Stout,5.9%,growler,3,3.5,4.5,2.5,2,3,12/21/09,"Many thanks to DrDogBeer for the chance to try this as part of 2009 Secret Santa.
Shared at The Brick Store.
Pour is a fairly standard, mid-chocolate brown color with a better than expected head. Retention and lace are OK, not great, but OK.
Nose is deinitely the strongest aspect of this beer wih a great, truly rich chocolate aroma coming from the glass even without much agitation. Very strong - very nice.
Frankly, after that, things go downhill quite a lot. The beer is a little acidic and lacks any kind of mouth presence. Very thin and I might even say watery. I am NOT confusing this a being a bigger stout either, even by the standards of ""normal"", lower ABV stouts the beer seems somewhat insipid.
Tastes produce the choclate malt character that one expects but it is nowhere near the intensity promised in the nose and frankly they are disappointing. Not much of anything present in the tase in the way of alcohol or hops either.
Looks OK, smells great but drinks poorly. That about sums it up."
Harviestoun Brewery Ltd.,Ola Dubh Special Reserve 40,,,Old Ale,8.0%,cask,4.38,3.5,5,4,5,4.5,2/21/09,"Thanks go out to pghlee for saving a growler of this from the recent cask at The Brick Store. He saved this for some of the stragglers that couldn't make it on the previous day for the cask tapping.
Jet black, still pour with no sign of life in terms of carbonation or head or lace. Perfectly still. The beer is actually nowhere near as viscous as the pour might suggest. I'd even go as far as to say it is relatively ""light"" compared to what it could have been.
The nose reveals the spirits, but it's not especially potent, rather it is a smooth, almost brandy like smell rather than a massive sinus clearing alcohol note.
The beer drinks very smoothly and lacks the alcohol heartburn that I was half-expecting. It's pretty much as you would expect from the original Old Ale with sweet smoothness and a simple classy, malt based experience.
Very tasty, excpetionally smooth and a great choice to sip and savor at the end of the evening. Much more drinkable than I was expecting too."
Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Co.,Burger Classic,,,American Adjunct Lager,?,can,3.33,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,12/18/10,"12 oz can courtesy of Kevin - thanks again!
Orangey, yellow pour with some pretty fierce carbonation. The head that forms initially is very high, fluffy and white. It fades quickly though to give nothing more than a tiny film on the surface of the beer and one or two wisps of lace.
Little to report here other than a pretty sweet, thin beer that to be honest I don't mind too much. It has a lemony aroma but not much of that is transferred to the taste. Some acidity and fairly drinkable given the style circumstances.
The pale malts are the feature here and they support the beer quite well. Not devoid of taste and the can is a bonus."
Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company,Leinenkugel's Original,,,American Adjunct Lager,4.6%,can,3.15,3,3,3,3.5,3.5,3/31/11,"12 oz can, many thanks to Kevin for the chance to try this American classic.
Pour gives lots of typical, American Adjunct Lager classic traits, but the body is a quite strange glassy affair with alarming clarity. As is son often the case the beer produces an initially very good head, but it fades very quickly and leaves no lace. Poor retention.
Nose is slightly vegetal but with no really offensive notes.
Tastes are much the same as the nose in terms of their neutrality and non-offensiveness but the lend a little more sweetness than the nose would have initially suggested. Bright carbonation leads to a refreshing, breaking crispness across the palate.
The beer feels clean to me which s definitely in its favor and a malty sweetness than I don't mind, but truth be told like so many other there really is no distinguishable or quantifiable 'taste' present other than the usual."
Jailhouse Brewing Company,Midnight Special India-Style Black Ale,,,American Black Ale,10.0%,bottle,4.45,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,3/26/11,"So, I had heard about the new limited, special series that Glenn at Jailhouse was going to release and this one popped up at Green's on Buford yesterday. $8.99 for the large (bomber like) bottle.
Part of the new, Solitary Confinement Series; Cool! Not sure that I understand the label with the train bearing down on the convict in his bed, but, hey...whatever!
The pour is a very rich looking, dense, totally black affair that pours with a real, 'gloop, gloop' noise as it comes out of the bottle. Heady is creamy.
The nose gives some light hops and is restrained, and balanced.
Tastes? OK, let's cut directly to the chase here - for ALL intents and purposes this is mildly hoppy, very creamy stout. It's VERY tasty, but if you come here looking for a typical (in so much as one can achieve for the newish style) Black India Ale then you may get a jolt.
Mild hops are the key with a REALLY creamy feel. Malt sweetness is VERY well represented too, and as is the case with ALL Jailhouse beers, this brew is finely balanced and not aggressive. A very large amount of dry chocolate character for me too, but it's not a dry cocoa or bakers chocolate - rather its a much richer, more milk chocolate like taste on my palate. The hops are present but at the same time they are definitely a backseat presence. They manifest themselves more in the finish and aftertaste rather than up front but even then they are countered with plenty of sweetness. The creamy feel is maintained throughout the beer for me.
Look, I have to be honest here. When I heard about the Jailhouse special series I was VERY excited. Then, when I saw the first one had ""India-Style Black Ale"" on the label I was really disappointed (NOT my favorite style, and I was worried about bandwagon jumping). However, when I cracked the bottle and drank the beer, I found that this was essentially a lightly hopped, really creamy, well-balanced stout so I had no need to worry.
Good grief, Glenn is making some superb beer, and if you ignore the style designation, this is another. Wow!"
König-Brauerei GmbH,König Pilsener,,,German Pilsener,4.9%,can,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,10/15/10,"500 mL can thanks to Kevin. Cheers mate.
A crazy colored pour which is pale, but distinctly yellow. Not golden like some macros, but really noticeably yellow. A very sticky but quite a light and fluffy head.
Very clean malts in the nose and tastes but it comes without much Saaz like bite in the finish. The lack of distinct bitterness means it's a little off base for me. 
Extremely clean and crisp and this is really n extension of those pale, pilsner malt bills. Again the finish lacks any intensity in the hop bitterness but the whole package sits well with me, and the beer is more drinkable than I was expecting.
Ultimately I really quite enjoyed this - tasty sand very drinkable."
Mad River Brewing Company,Steelhead Extra Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),5.6%,bottle,2.08,2.5,2,2,2.5,2,4/9/11,"12 oz stubbie bottle. Blue label that is different to the picture in the BA db. As a single form Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour is a tad disappointing as the beer sits somewhat lifeless with a classic macro look - no head, no retention, no lace and a golden body. Color is fine, carbonation is not. Head is particularly disappointing to me.
Nose and tastes give a distinct vegetal sweetness and a malty experience that feels musty and old. No date on the bottle that I can see, so who knows? Finish lingers a little, but not really ina manner that one would want. Feels 'stale', but with no dating how are we supposed to know. Maybe this is a fresh bottle that always tastes like this!
This is quite a dry beer, but that doesn't save it from being a really lackluster effort. I'm not sure if it's the age of the beer or it's general lack of appeal, but it fails to satisfy on a number of levels.
Quite poor."

Retro style can which is attractive - good times.
Slightly hazed with a macro colored pour, the beer appears similar to a macro adjunct with perhaps a notch above in terms of color and head. lace and retention are still huge issues though.
Nose and tastes deliver a macro adjunct experience as well, but it is less sweet and offensive than many in a similar group. Fairly neutral in the final analysis, but not really offensive or too sweet. Clean beer with a lack of linger aftertaste or unpleasantness.
Carbonation seems appropriate and the beer does what it is supposed to. 
No more, no less here with a slightly sweet but non-offensive package that would work in a few, outdoor, summer situations."
Minhas Craft Brewery,Mountain Creek Classic Lager,,,American Pale Lager,5.5%,can,1.9,2,2,2,2,1.5,3/19/11,"12 oz can thanks go out to Kevin for the chance to try this one.
The latest in a huge parade of Minhas mediocrity.
This time the pour gives a pretty serious initially head, but it collapses to give nothing in terms of lace or retention.
Body is a golden color with a disappointing lack of carbonation - weak to be honest.
Pretty offensive, sweet, grainy corn hits the nose and palate and never gives anything more than that. Vegetal notes and a more than average sweetness drives home the adjunct feel.
Not good, difficult to consume and typically Minhas. that adds up to a write-off for me. Blah. Belch. Meh."
Murphy Brewery Ireland Limited,Murphy's Irish Stout,,,Irish Dry Stout,4.0%,nitro-can,2.95,4,2,3,3,3.5,9/22/06,"$3.75 for the ""draft style"" can at Taco Mac, Douglasville, GA, USA. Brewed in England under license from Murphy's. Imported to the USA.



Good clean looking appearance with a nice ""lace"" aka ""a nitro foam head that sticks to the glass"" with jet black body. Head is thin. Smell is non-descript to me with a feint, sweet alcohol aroma.



Taste is dry and smooth with very, very little taste. Thin mouthfeel and very easy to drink, but this is an extremely ordinary offering in the can. Much better on draft."
New England Brewing Co.,Atlantic Amber,,,American Amber / Red Ale,5.0%,can,2.85,3.5,3,2.5,3.5,3,11/20/10,"Retired? OK. Very recent purchase from Grassroots, Jacksonville, FL, USA. 12 oz can.
Pour is a somewhat drab drown with lots of chill haze. head is quite dense and rich and leaves a lot of sticky lace. the aroma is pretty neutral even after warming, but there are a few malt whiffs from the glass.
Caramel and light toffee notes make up the majority of the flavor profile and the beer is rather sweet. A little damp cardboard too.
Not very impressive beer and the retired factor in the BA db has me wondering how old this is. The beer seems a bit musty which is a sign of older product, but with no freshness date on the can that I can see, the review stands."
New England Brewing Co.,Elm City Lager,,,German Pilsener,5.0%,can,3.65,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,11/19/10,"12 oz can from Grassroots in Jacksonville, GA, USA.
The beer has a somewhat disturbingly, pale color and in terms of the hue looks a bit weak. Paradoxically, the head is resplendent - high, fluffy and full of sticky lace, it looks really good. Admittedly it is not really a classic looking Pilsner, nor is the head typical of the style but it looks OK.
Carbonation is quite high too.
This is a very, very sweet beer that I actually like. It does NOT deliver a classic, Noble or Saaz bite (which I would want if I was concerned about style), but it is very drinkable.
Having said all of that it seems like it is closer to a macro, adjunct lager than a classic Pils, but it does have some kind of strange appeal. Perhaps the can helps, I don't know, but I bet this beer will not impress some folk. Although I like it, I would understand why other people didn't fancy it much."
New Holland Brewing Company,New Holland Night Tripper,,,American Double / Imperial Stout,10.8%,bottle,3.53,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3/20/11,"22 oz bottle from Brawley's, Charlotte, NC, USA.
Light foil on the neck of the bottle.
New Holland is one of the few brewers that get to NC but not to GA, so I generally pick up something from them every time I'm up in NC.
Inky black pour with a modest head. Some nice, then mocha film sit atop the black body. Carbonation is reserved but entirely appropriate.
Nose and tastes give a fairly significant sweet effect. Some alcohol and lots of dry chocolate in the finish. A little warmth but considering the ABV the beer is pretty drinkable and the alcohol is largely hidden.
Actually the whole package seems surprisingly light to me, especially in terms of the mouthfeel. No slickness or difficult coating of the mouth.
The biitterness is not really that evident until the aftertaste when a combination of very light charcoal, smoke, dry bakers chocolate and a touch more alcohol come together.
Smooth, relatively well disguised alcohol and a beer that is typical of the American version of the style. No t my favorite, but a solid 'B' for me."

Pour produces some nice sticky, white lace on top of a slightly murky, brown body. Not really very interesting to look at but at the same time the head is decent, produces some nice lace and is somewhat well retained.
Nose offers little other than some sweet malts.
The tastes are fairly ordinary with a few hoppy hints amongst the fairly dry, average malt base. Drinks easily and has good carbonation for the style. 
No groundbreaking moments here, just a solid, domestic version of a style that lacks much definition or character. Probably best sourced close to its home, very fresh and perhaps even on-tap."

Strange one this.
The beer pours an unattractive, soup-like, nasty, brown, murky color like dirty water. A mediocre head and virtually no retention complete the ugliness of the delivery - really unattractive color, especially for something that calls itself an IPA.
The funny thing is, that the beer tastes a LOT better than the appearance would suggest, BUT it is an incredibly fruity, sweet IPA and NOT one that shows any signs of significant hop bitterness or any alcohol (I was amazed to see this listed at 7%).
There are some light pineapple and bubble-gum notes, but also some almond (marzipan) tastes too. It drinks a bit better than that description might suggest, but there's virtually no hop bitterness that I pick up.
Difficult to get past the soup that greets the eyes, and pretty much a terrible beer if you want a bitter, American IPA, but it tasted better than all of that sounds. having said that, this needs to go back to the drawing board before I would EVER considering buying it again."
Pabst Brewing Company,Blatz Beer,,,American Adjunct Lager,4.9%,can,1.9,2,1.5,2,3,1.5,1/23/11,"12 oz can, many thanks to Kevin for the chance to try this.
The pour produces an almost transparent lemon yellow color, a highly carbonated but a typically poorly retained head and not much lace. Frankly it screams American adjunct lager which I suppose could be viewed as a good thing!
Light, grainy and neutral nose.
Tastes are watery and only give a sweet, light vegetal and light grainy effect.
Pretty much devoid of any character or taste but to be honest not offensive in any way. Still, pretty much exactly as one would expect"

Very typical for the style, a cloudy and turbid brown soup like affair with some big, rocky, pitted, off-white head and lace. Retention is not great. It's a bit of an ugly looking beer for me.
Nose and tastes deliver typical big, hoppy alcohol notes, and there is the requisite dry finish. 
Strangely, the alcohol is fairly well hidden during the drink, but in the aftertaste and at the end the beer packs its' full punch. The combination of the dry character (good) and the somewhat overbearing alcohol (bad), make this a one and done beer for me.
Not a bad example, but it's too aggressive for me and I found it a bit muddled and lacking focus."
Red Brick Brewing Company,Fred Brick,,,California Common / Steam Beer,5.2%,on-tap,3.03,3.5,3,3,3,3,10/1/10,"""Fred Brick"" brewed by Red Brick in association with Fred Crudder of ""The Fred"" fame, and Taco Mac's beverage manager. (Nothing like naming bars and beers after yourself!)



Anyway...



...16 oz pout at Taco Mac on the East West Connector, Austell, GA, USA.



Pour offers a nice clarity with a lighter than expected golden color. It certainly doesn't have much ""Red"" or ""Amber"" color. Head is about average and offers some lace. Looks OK.



Nose and tastes offer the usual Red Brick experience. Solid, OK, but pretty much forgettable. Simple hop profile and a gentle malt backbone hold the thing together. Seems to me like there is a familiarity about the yeast strain used which I don't dislike as such, but it seems to offer a certain blandness to most of Red Brick's beers. BTW - I'm NOT sure this is a fact, but it drinks that way to me.



Finish is clean, but it's presence is just so so for a beer that has been (apparently) brewed as a ""one-off"" and as a ""special"" release. 



Drinkable? Sure, I'd have one or two (well, maybe one), and ultimately disappointing and terribly uninteresting.



Not offensive, but a light caramel based beer with no distinguishing character as per usual from the ""rut"" that IS Red Brick Brewery. What I'd expect from Taco Mac, the beer destination for consumers that *think* they know beer but really just tick beers to collect T-shirts."
Ridgeway Brewing,Querkus Smoked Oaked Porter,,,English Porter,5.8%,bottle,3.93,4.5,4,4,3,4,4/3/11,"The presentation of this beer certainly makes one think that this could be a Scandinavian beer - something about the name and the label. Had no idea this was a Ridgeway beer until I looked at the label very carefully.
A really pretty color on the pour with plenty of ruby red highlights throughout the beer. Conservative head but still gives decent retention and some nice lace. However, the color is the star in the appearance; quite exquisite.
Nose and tastes give a mild smokiness that permeates the air above the beer. The beer is quite sweet and the malts dominate. There's no doubt that this is a unusual beer. At first this is not a surprise to me since an English Porter will certainly be less aggressive and more subtle than the American version of the style, but that's not where this ends. In reality this beer is really more like a smoked Dark Euro lager than even an English Porter, and it does not feel especially rich or creamy, but it is a very tasty and drinkable beer. The smoke is really subtle, sweet and light and it works really nicely.
Mouthfeel is definitely light.
A little unusual, so if you can accept that it is definitely NOT an American Porter (that shouldn't be hard), and also that it's not a very typical English Porter either (less easy to accept), and take it for what it is, you'll probably enjoy it."
Russian River Brewing Company,Sanctification,,,American Wild Ale,6.5%,bottle,4.45,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,4/2/11,"375 mL bottle courtesy of Ross - many thanks. Batch 005.
Chilled this off perfectly and the medium pop on opening the corked & caged bottle produces some nice gun smoke. 
The head 'fizzes' up initially but of course it does not last and there is not much lace or retention. A very thin film of bubbles sit atop the beer.
The color is REALLY memorable. A very, very distinct lemon colored, yellow body. Super bright in terms of the hue and a stand out feature of the brew.
The nose is fresh and bright if somewhat predictable. Some apple notes and a little tart alcohol.
Tastes strike all of the right notes. Light, tart cider, citrus brightness and Brett fusion. Sharp and tart without lingering, the beer is clean. I really light the carbonation that seems perfect. It dances on the tongue and titillates but never gets prickly like beers of this type, can. As the beer warms I get a little more sweet character with some fruit coming through. Citrus. Green apples and gooseberries.
Overall a lovely, tasty beer which simply summarizes what RR does magnificently well."

16 oz pint, on tap at Taco Mac, Woodstock, GA, USA.
Golden pour that produces some nice lace despite the head fading fairly fast. Carbonation is medium.
Nose delivers an unusual combination of a decent Pils-like bite of hops, but also a sweet background to the beer. The sweetness is the thing that stays with me which would normally make me a little unhappy, but the fact that there IS a decent dose of hop bitterness too, helps me to enjoy this beer a little more than I thought I might. Then sweetness comes with a touch of fruit, a bit like some peach infused soda.
Smooth in the mouth, the carbonation seems just right.
A simple beer that doesn't really encapsulate a typical German Pils, but it is drinkable and an excellent offering to open up some eyes for crossover potential."
Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,Ovila,,,Dubbel,?,bottle,3.93,3,3.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,4/8/11,"Corked & caged bottle with an unusual shape around the neck. Opens with a fearful pop with a button mushroom like cork - I suggest great care opening this one, but to be honest I would rather have it that way than without sufficient carbonation. Nice gun smoke.
Attractive reddish brown hue which seems less muddy than the usual Dubbel appearance which is a bonus. Having said that beer is a dreadfully disappointing head and it fades horribly. No lace, no retention - shame.
Light, alcoholic breadiness in the nose, but it's pretty muted.
The tastes are a very nice malty, lightly alcohol based fruitiness. I feels quite bready and has a little depth as well. A touch of caramelized raspberries in the back and the finish offers more of the alcohol soaked, marzipan based maltiness - very nice.
Tastes are the strong point here but the head retention is terribly poor."
Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,Sierra Nevada Tumbler Autumn Brown Ale,,,American Brown Ale,5.5%,on-tap,4,4,4,4,4,4,8/14/10,"On tap @ Taco Mac in Peachtree City, GA, USA.
Absolutely delighted by the concept of a SN beer that *should* reduce the hop profile to a lesser role, let's see if the beer manages to apply that theory to practice.
Nothing to complain about in the pour. A decent dark brown color (personally I'd like to see a little more red in the body but that's really a personal preference) with a nice, rocky, full head that lingers and produces some super lace. Good looking beer.
Nose and tastes do well to uphold the malt aspect of the Brown Ale. Whenever I see the style ""American"" Brown Ale I slightly cringe, since what that usually translates into is a Brown Ale that is over-hopped. To me, Brown Ales are one style that simply suffers when we start to add extravagant hop profiles, and given SN's ""house style"" this had warnings ALL over it for me. Personally I think there IS a little too much hop profile in the beer, BUT by SN standards, and by the standards on many American Brown Ales, I can live with it. A little toffee starts the beer and there is plenty of light roasted sweet malts to help it along. The finish and aftertaste seem to reflect a little too much bitterness for me, but to be honest it's short lived and fades pretty quickly. NOT a fruity beer, but still gives light touches and manages to stay away from jarring bitterness.
The beer does manage to retain an important quality of Brown Ales which is the moreish element. One is never quite enough so I credit SN for pulling that off.
So, we've managed to gt SN to dial back the hops and produce a very nice Brown Ale, now all we need to do is to take the ABV down to 4% so we can call this a session ale and it can take its proper place in the drinking rotation! That might be too much to wish for! All in all a success that should go well with some cooler weather."
Sixpoint,Sixpoint Express,,,Quadrupel (Quad),11.3%,growler,3.18,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,7/25/09,"22 oz bomber courtesy of Grant via Bierkraft. Must have been filled from a tap, so I guess this could be classified as a growler fill.
The appearance is unusual for a Quad. It is very orange. Clouded body and a decent amount of head, lace and retention considering the ABV. A little light for a Quad.
Nose and tastes are extremly fruity. Alcohol is conspicuous by it's relative absence in both the nose and tastes considering the whopping 11.3. The fruit is not easy to place, but it's definitely a bubble-gum based thing. The alcohol comes through a touch in the finish, but to be honest it's not at all overpowering. Sweetness begins to grind a touch after half of the first glass. 
Very powerful beer in terms of the ABV and of course this is really a double-edged sword.
Not really my cup of tea and at 11.3 it simply becomes a beer that requires just too much planning and effort for me, without the pay-off of being a great brew."
Ska Brewing Co.,Modus Hoperandi,,,American IPA,6.8%,can,3.9,4.5,5,3.5,4,3.5,3/9/11,"12 oz can from the Beer Dispensary, Apex, NC, USA.
I've had this beer a few times before, but this is the first review.
There is absolutely no doubt that the nose that the beer generates is absolutely unique and extraordinary. A big, fat, green, fresh hop presence that lingers and is the highlight of the beer for me.
The copper colored, clear body gives a tremendously impressive head and a lot of sticky lace. Good signs.
Some metallic notes and plenty of bitterness that lingers and drives the beer into some dark territory. The beer is actually increasingly aggressive and doesn't let up much. Slight alcohol burn in the back end, finish and burn in the end. Plenty of resinous pine but lacks much grapefruit based sweetness. Quite harsh but paradoxically drinkable.
Hoppy burps ensue.
Hop heads dream, and aggressive, American, modern classic."
Skinner's Brewery,Skinner's Betty Stogs Bitter,,,English Bitter,4.0%,cask,4.48,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,9/1/08,"Deliciously sessionable, simple example of an English bitter. Summer 2007 from notes - somewhere in Cornwall!
Main characteristics include the biscuit malts, the smooth mouthfeel and the drinkability. This is the kind of beer that one thinks of as being typical of the refreshing, quaffable and moreish bitter of yesteryear.
Mid brown pour with a better than expected head considering the cask serving. Long, drawn out nose and aftertaste that match perfectly. Malts compete with one another in a gentle competetion for your senses. Subtle beyond belief, but this adds to the drinkability. Mild hop notes that are clean and citrus based complete the package.
A great example of the beer I love the most and the type of beer that seems impossible to find in the USA. It's their loss."
Sly Fox Brewing Company,Phoenix Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),5.3%,can,3.95,4,4,4,3.5,4,8/11/10,"12 oz can from a recent trip to NY. Purchased at Finger lakes Beverage in Ithaca, NY, USA.
Nice pour with a good, solid copper colored body. Head is decent and leaves some pleasing, broken lace. Carbonation is mild but in proportion.
Nose offers good malts but also a lightly assertive bitterness - it has strength, but in no way do the hops overwhelm the beer or make it feel bitter.
Tastes offer a similar balance to the nose, and the beer works nicely. It's definitely ""American"" in the manner that it does have some significant bite and hop presence, however the malts keep pushing back to give some decent balance.
The beer offers a sensible ABV with PLENTY of taste. There is a good degree of assertiveness (a word which keeps coming to mind) and the hop note is both (paradoxically) aggressive and subtle.
High drinkability, a nice beer."
Sly Fox Brewing Company,Route 113 India Pale Ale,,,American IPA,7.0%,can,3.98,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,7/14/10,"12 oz can.
Very interesting beer.
The pour gives an amazingly dark, copper color with superb clarity. The copper color is pronounced and quite dark for the style. Nice head, decent lace, good looker.
There is a real, significant bitterness in the nose and initial tastes, but these change to a quite obvious, herbal, earthy, light spiced hop note. It feels quite organic.
The beer lacks any real dry character (that I was expecting), but still delivers a firm finish. Hints of grapefruit are also present.
All in all absolutely delighted."
Southern Tier Brewing Company,Old Man (Winter Ale),,,Old Ale,7.2%,on-tap,4,4,4,4,4,4,11/26/10,"This is NOT an Old Ale in my book. I was actually expecting it to be labeled as a Winter Warmer, but it drinks more like an American IPA.
On tap at The Irish Bred Pub in Douglasville, GA, USA.
Great looking pour with the deep copper, mahogany body showing superb clarity underneath a bone-white head. Head is not terribly well maintained, but there is some decent lacing.
Nose gives up some fresh, raw hops.
The beer is much hoppier than I was expecting and this is the abiding memory. Some good levels of bitterness that makes the beer drink like a freshly hopped, American IPA. Some citrus notes and pretty, green and fresh feel about the beer. Malts are present in quantities that hold the whole thing together nicely. Alcohol is well hidden and beer drinks lower than the ABV would suggest it might.
Not exactly what I expected, but at the same time I was pleasantly surprised and found the beer both refreshing and moreish.
Good stuff, better than expected."
Southern Tier Brewing Company,Iniquity (Imperial Black Ale),,,American Black Ale,9.0%,on-tap,3.93,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,10/30/10,"It seems as though Southern Tier has decided to jump on the IBA bandwagon since the tap handle for this now proudly displays the letters ""iba"" in a very prominent fashion and ""Iniquity"" in much smaller font.
On tap, Taco Mac Douglasville, GA, USA. I've never seen this on tap before, but then again I've never really looked for it since this is a style that generally does not interest me much.
Pour has a couple of interesting aspects. Firstly it is black but definitely has some reddish brown highlights a the extremities, and secondly it produces a really nice, thick, creamy head (almost like a nitro-stout pour) that leaves plenty of pretty lace. It looks really good.
Nose and tastes reveal plenty of grap[efruit based, fruity citrus notes and a little pine. More ""East Coast"" than ""West coast"", which of course, is entirely appropriate. Some roasty malts too, but th ebitterness again generally comes from the hops rather than a darkened malt which again seems spot on for the style.
Finishes clean and easy.
For a style that I don't care for much at all, this was pretty good and pretty drinkable. I'd still prefer my IPA's/DIPA's to LOOK like those beers, but this replicates a bitter beer very nicely.
Having said that, not something that I would reach for very often in the future, however not a beer that you should ignore (at least once)."
Spoetzl Brewery,Shiner Blonde,,,American Pale Lager,4.4%,can,2,2,2,2,3,1.5,2/5/11,"12 oz can courtesy of Kevin - many thanks.
Well, it is what is. No more, no less.
Typical, light straw colored pour with perfect clarity, low carbonation and, virtually no head and zero retention and lace. Could be one of a million different macros of the same ilk, but the color is getting close to completely non-existent. Pale as plae can be.
Nose gives a touch of grainy alcohol.
Tastes are a largely neutral sweetness and almost nothing else. Character is firmly at zero, but no skunk and perhaps a slight bitterness in the swallow.
Somewhat refreshing, but so is water."
Steinhaus Brewing Co.,Mission St. Hefeweizen,,,Hefeweizen,4.7%,bottle,3.18,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,4/8/11,"22 oz bottle from the Trader Joe's cheap and cheerful line. I have had some really good success with some of these budget brews, but there have also been one or two stinkers so it's always an adventure - let's see what we have here.
The beer goes into the 500 mL Tucher Weizen glass. It's color is definitely out of the ordinary for the style. It's deep, orangey copper which is a long way away from a typical, lemony yellow body. The head is good initially, and to be fair doesn't fade as badly as many other cheaper beers, and even produces a little lace and retention. The color is striking if for no other reason than it's a little odd!
Tastes do replicate some very mild banana notes but the beer lacks a cutting edge. It feels a bit bloated and buttery and does not give a serious, sharp tang. 
The finish threatens more Hefe character, and to be honest it does deliver a little more, but at the end it feels a bit flabby for the style.
Having said that I was still happy purchase; didn't expect a lot, so wasn't disappointed."
Terminal Brew House,Thrilla Vanilla,,,American Porter,?,growler,3.95,4,4,4,3.5,4,12/12/09,"Thanks go out to Scott for bringing this one back from TN. Cheers Bud.
The beer looks great. Large, off-white head with some serious red highlights and good density of color. Nose gives the vanilla as expected but quite reserved.
Plenty of vanilla in the taste too and perhaps some smoke too. The degree of chocolate malt character is quite pronounced as well. That was surprising.
Mellow, drinkable and a tasty brew. My first from this brewhouse and I am impressed; definitely want to explore this place some more. 
Drinks easily a very nice rendition of the style.
Commericial description;
The addition of vanilla beans in the fermentation of our Porter makes this dark but smooth treat that much more dynamic in your mouth. We believe that this aromatic vanilla porter will produce a feeling in you that only the juxtaposition of smooth and mild but commanding and flavorful can create. This rope-a-dope style of taste bud jabbing is what defines this tantalizing cool weather cocktail. This beer may make you actually lighter on your feet and proclaim yourself the greatest of all time."
Terrapin Beer Company,Terrapin Substance Abuse,,,American Double / Imperial Stout,?,on-tap,4.25,4,4,4,4.5,5,8/14/10,"Sampled at Leon's Decatur for the ""Terrapin Takeover"" on 8/12/10. I went to this event specifically for this and Big Sloppy Monster, neither of which I had tried before.
Rumor had it that this was a '06 version but at the time there was no way to confirm.
Beer poured into a 10 oz glass looks much as expected. Jet black, but with a tan head that was a little smaller and less well-retained than other versions of this beer.
The combination of age and liquor element provides a beer that is astonishingly smooth. Virtually ALL the edges were taken off this and as a result the drinkability was incredibly high. For me the liquor and alcohol elements were almost completely missing, and they had been replaced by a velvet smooth creaminess. The only hint of alcohol was in the warming finish. Roast on the malts seems light, and overall the age has produce a beer with a light touch that kisses the palate. Very gentle drinking. Coffee elements have also faded, but this does not detract from the experience for me. A lot of sweetness and vanilla.
Delicious, but this will disappoint if you are looking for an aggressive, boozy, in your face beer."
Terrapin Beer Company,Terrapin Big Sloppy Monster,,,American Amber / Red Ale,8.3%,on-tap,3.83,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,8/14/10,"On tap at Leon's, Decatur, Atlanta, GA, USA on 08/12/10 as part of the ""Terrapin Takeover"". Attended the event particularly for this beer and Substance Abuse.
10 oz pour.
The beer poured an alarmingly cloudy mid-brown with some serious yeastiness. The keg must have been terribly unsettled, and it wasn't until the second glass that I had (about an hour after the first), that I felt I had a handle on this. (It settled down in that time).
The beer had lost it's hoppy edge in the barrel and it had turned into a much milder beast. Age and liquor turned the Big Hoppy Monster into a tamed beast, and it would be difficult to draw comparisons between this and the original version. That isn't to say that I didn't enjoy the beer, I did, it was smooth and easy drinking, but it wasn't just a slightly amped up BHM - it had changed. to be expected I suppose. Some vanilla, muted hops and sweeter than i remember, but the beer is at least interesting and offers a decent experience.

Thunderhead Brewing Company,Golden Frau Honey Wheat,,,Braggot,7.5%,can,2.68,3,2.5,2.5,3,3,8/11/10,"12 oz can thanks to Kevin for a chance to try this beer. Astonished to see that this is a Braggot - to say that style is fairly rare is a significant understatement.
Alarmingly thin looking macro pour. The beer is VERY pale and lacks any depth in the color - not what I was expecting at ALL. Disappointing head and very watery.
Nose and tastes (somewhat unfortunately), follow suit and the lacks much presence at all. Some extra sweetness that one would expect, but after that the beer just seems lackluster and missing way too many distinguishing elements. Don't really know how to place it, but it feels weak and lacking several key characteristics.
Alcohol seems well hidden although there is a hint in the finish.
Blah - very disappointing on a number of levels. High hopes that are dashed."
Triangle Brewing Company,Triangle Belgian Golden Ale,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,8.0%,can,4.23,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,3/10/11,"Same beer as this review; http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/16186/38572/?ba=Ding but this time from the 12 oz can. Purchased at The Beer Dispensary in Apex, NC, USA.
Very much the same feel as before with the sweetness coming through as the main asset. This beer is sweet enough to be firmly in the Tripel category for me. You've GOT to enjoy some phenolic esters and a LOT of sweetness to get your head around this.
The color does seem lighter, clearer and more golden compared to the last review and it looks good.
Still very drinkable for me and the can does offer some more flexibility for some but not sure that it is necessary."
Wild Heaven Craft Beers,Ode To Mercy,,,American Brown Ale,8.2%,on-tap,3,4,4,3,2.5,2,12/7/10,"On-tap at Taco Mac in Douglasville, GA, USA.
Pour is a good looking, dark brown color with some nice clarity. Carbonation is relatively low which seems appropriate. Small head with some spotty film on the surface and a little lace. A little thin.
I read a couple of reviews of this beer which described a coffee note to the beer which to be honest I took with a pinch of salt. ""Coffee"" taste is one of those default, fallback tastes that I think people sometimes imagine in Stouts and Porters and other ""dark"" beers, and in a Brown Ale it seemed a little unlikely; in reality it was spot on!
Quite a lot of coffee in the nose and also in the initial tastes. The coffee settles down a bit and the beer goes into ""Brown Ale mode"" with a little nuttiness and some deeper malts. All of that is fine and dandy and it's quite nice, but the problem here is the alcohol. It seems to bump heads with the relatively subtle style, and with the mouthfeel being quite thin, it takes on a solvent aggression that grates on me very quickly. 
I suppose that Imperial Brown Ales are OK, but to me it gets tedious and drinking is not easy. This beer lacks the depth to hold up so much alcohol and in the end it gets quite solvent-like.
A potentially tasty profile spoiled by too much alcohol."
Wild Heaven Craft Beers,Invocation,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,8.5%,on-tap,3.93,2.5,4,4,4,4,9/24/10,"Small pour at Ormsby's. Surprised to see this brew on a recent afternoon visit. Presented in a small snifter.
Beer does DEFINITELY not have the color of a Belgian Pale, and on the menu it was advertised a ""Strong Golden Ale"" which again, it most definitely isn't. Not sure what they are going for here. To me it has more of the character of a dark(er), Belgian ""single""/""simple"" with perhaps a hint of Belgian IPA character in there too (American influence - unwelcome in my book).
The pour is amber with a fair amount of chill-haze. Light, but appropriate carbonation and a relatively smooth mouthfeel.
The nose and tastes combine to get an interesting sweet-sour note of light pineapple and then in the back end some more pineapple. Nice touches of Belgian yeast and some alcohol. All in all quite enjoyable.
The only problem I have is with the color. If this truly were a golden color, or indeed a Belgian PALE, then I would be happier."
Yo-Ho Brewing Company,Tokyo Black,,,American Porter,5.0%,can,3.28,4,3,3.5,3,3,2/26/11,"12 oz can from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA, a little while ago.
Genuine import since the adhesive sticker that yields the Government warning obscures the original Japanese text that is printed on the can.
Black pour with a few red highlights, largely in keeping with the style. Head is not great, but sticky lace does suggest some quality.
Also in keeping with the style it lacks refinements and delivers an aggressive, watery feel without depth or creaminess. Bitter character comes through quite a lot and the beer drinks less easily than I would hope.

Pivovar Náchod a.s.,Primátor Double Bock Beer,,,Doppelbock,10.5%,bottle,3.53,4,4,3.5,3.5,3,6/20/10,"500 mL bottle, different to the current presentation in the BA db and a $2.99 purchase at Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Let me preface this sentence by saying that I am a fan of malty, sweet, non-hop forward brews, and I am VERY experienced in the Doppelbock style so I know what to expect, BUT...WOW, this SUPER, SUPER Sweet! I mean in a way that I don't remember encountering for a long, long time!
Pour is the standard, deep brown almost black color with a small, coffee-like head that fades quickly. Not much lace, but that's OK, it's a pretty high ABV beer. Nevertheless, still solid looking. Quite acceptable.
Nose gives the expected sweetness, but the sugar tastes PILE on in a very harsh manner. Not really syrupy (which is the surprising thing, but sweet beyond all belief. WOW! I love sweet, malt based beers and I was expecting a pretty sugary brew based on the style, but this surpassed all expectations. Lots of molasses and honey and frankly not much else. The sugar gives a decent depth to the mouthfeel (full), but obviously detracts somewhat from the drinkability.
Interesting bee as it flirts with the style. An over-sweet Doppelbock which is a thing I wasn't sure was possible. As Ken Wolstenholme would say, ""It is now""!"

Standard golden clarity on the pour into the Sweetwater Pils glass, with a steady but not large carbonation. In fact carbonation falls away rapidly to leave the beer feels very flat at the end of the brew.
Strange nose that sweet and veggie/grainy. Not especially attractive.
This is disappointing. It is not very clean at all (one of the chief attributes that I am looking for in a Pils), and it has a weird sweet/cardboard taste. Not clean in the finish either.
As I say, not at all exciting and in the final analysis even quite poor."
Cigar City Brewing,Improvisación Oatmeal Rye India-style Brown Ale,,,American Brown Ale,9.00%,bottle,1.88,3,2,1.5,3.5,1.5,2/6/2011,"Given to me as a gift from a well-known bar owner. Many thanks.
750 mL capped bottle. Not really sure what a Oatmeal, Rye, India Brown Ale is, but...
Opening produces a HUGE gusher - not a trivial amount of beer lost, in fact around one third of the total contents are lost on the kitchen counter. Makes me think 'infection' or a best 'over-carbonated', we'll see.
The pour gives a frankly UGLY, chocolate brown color to the body that looks like viscous med - totally opaque. The head is obviously very good, well retained, a coffee-color and gives some nice lace. In that respect the beer looks good, but the color is just pain UGLY. An immediate paradox in the appearance.
The nose gives an acidic twang and some blue cheese. This makes me think Brett or infection.
The tastes reflect the nose and offer an acidic, light, blue cheese note and not much else. Funk is all over the place and the sour note persists through the beer, or at least the amount I can get down before drain pouring the rest of the bottle.
Disappointing."
De Leyerth Brouwerijen (Urthel),Urthel Saisonnière,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,6.00%,bottle,4.23,4,4,4.5,4,4,3/10/2011,"11.2 oz bottle.
Surprised to see this at The Beer Dispensary in Apex, NC, USA. Not an Urthel beer that I have ever seen in the US before.
Pour gives a pretty standard, honeyed, hazed, lemon color with a nice creamy white foam on top. Some nice lace as the beer sits in the Brasserie de l'Abbaye des Rocs goblet.
A significant, sweet earthiness permeates the nose of this beer right from the get go. Organic feel about the beer.
In typical Urthel fashion the tastes are a little reminiscent of a Belgian IPA with some significant bitterness and a little hoppy note in the finish. The hoppy bitterness breaks the white pepper bitterness open a touch, and *slightly* moves the beer to a different level from your typical Saison.
The aftertastes accentuates the soapy, hoppy bitter section but it never gets aggressive and always feels within, if somewhat prodding at the edges, of the style.
Tasty, and a touch off-beat for the style but for me it works well. Nice"

A crazy colored pour which is pale, but distinctly yellow. Not golden like some macros, but really noticeably yellow. A very sticky but quite a light and fluffy head.
Very clean malts in the nose and tastes but it comes without much Saaz like bite in the finish. The lack of distinct bitterness means it's a little off base for me. 
Extremely clean and crisp and this is really n extension of those pale, pilsner malt bills. Again the finish lacks any intensity in the hop bitterness but the whole package sits well with me, and the beer is more drinkable than I was expecting.
Ultimately I really quite enjoyed this - tasty sand very drinkable."
Les Trois Mousquetaires,Série Signature Kellerbier,,,Keller Bier / Zwickel Bier,5.50%,bottle,3.58,5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,2/12/2011,"750 mL corked & caged bottle. Opens with a decent pop. Arbor Place Beverage, Douglasville, GA, USA.
Hazy, butterscotch orange pour with a splendid head. The head is very ice-cream like, and threatens to be almost solid. Thick white density with retention to match. Great looking beer.
Nose gives a characteristic musty, rye note which is carried into the taste. The tastes give quite a bitter, peppery note that lacks the charm or fruitiness of a beer like a Saison, or the sweetness of a Tripel, two styles that also offer some pepper. This seems more black pepper than white pepper.
Not a style I care for a lot, but this did look fantastic and offered a pretty nice drink, but the musty character lingers a little and it's what turns me away from these beers a bit."

Right off the top, I think this should be categorized as an English Pale (at least in the way it drinks).
WOW! A revelation. Obviously I went into this with some severe trepidation but came out amazed!
The pour is a crystal clear, orangey/macro color with some limited head but surprising sticky lace.
Nose is pretty neutral, but it gives away some simple malt-like notes.
The tastes are AMAZING when you consider the nature of the beer. There is a lot of tangerine, orange and sweetened grapefruit, a VERY clean finish and a lingering hop bitterness that HONESTLY reminds me of some of the better, casked, highly-hopped English Pale Ales.
Mouthfeel is where things go south, but if you can imagine a super, crisp, English Pale with a decent amount of thirst-quenching qualities, then you can get a handle on this beer.
I am actually going to purchase this again as a ""normal"" beer.
Truly amazing when you consider the lack of malts."

Bottle still in the circular rather than the oval style from Bullock's, Marietta, GA, USA. $1.19 for 500 mL on sale. Jubbly.

Still full of malty goodness with mild spice and wave after wave of first class drinkability. As smooth as you like, what a GREAT beer.

Delighted to see this turn up in GA at Green's on Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA - means it went ON to, and then OFF of, my Wants List very quickly!
Even though I LOVE the old, oval bottles, this spherical, 500 mL, green glass, embossed version is also superb looking - always have loved the labels too, this is 10/10 for presentation, it's almost worth buying this JUST for the bottle! Let's see if what's inside matches.
Dark brown pour (a few red highlights) with a huge, mocha, bubbly, dense head. Lace is excellent and the retention is first class.
Creamy mouthfeel meets the tongue and mouth followed by some residual bitterness. Quite hoppy as opposed to spicy. Some metallic bitterness in the finish that completes the picture. Drinks like a classic English bitter, with a sturdy malt backbone holding it together. Once again, it bears saying that, for me, we are not talking spice, but we are talking bitter hops. It has some old-fashioned, Black Country/Midlands Mild character. AGAIN - no spice in terms of Winter Warmer.
Alcohol is nowhere to be seen with this beer, and although it is well above the traditional view of a sessionable beer, it drinks in that category.
Drinkability is amazing, this is a very high quality beer."

Pour reveals a really quite dark body with a small, but dense ad creamy head. Spotty head (again creamy), some lace. Interesting beer that combines a number of attributes; creaminess of a Porter, a little spice that is reminiscent of a Winter Warmer (that apparently comes from the Goldings), and the classic biscuit malt subtlety that you would expect from a typical, simple but well made English bitter.
Extraordinarily drinkable, a delicious brew. Haven't seen it in the USA, we need it here!"

Very delicate brew that is fairly consistent with the English Pale Ale style that it claims to be in. Plenty of citrus notes fill both the nose and the palate, along with some prickly carbonation - rather too much for my liking.
This is an exceptionally ""light"" beer, and IMO it suffers a little becasue of it. A tad watery, I think the lack of body is the main fault. Lots of sweetness (that I like) and a very clean feeling brew.
Women tend to like this, and it is very easy drinking and good as a summer quencher, but ultimately this left me wanting more and not satisfied."

Simple looking brew with an darkish, amber body the looks a little thin. Decent head, some lace and retention. Aroma is ALL grapefruit and to me it is wonderful. A LOT of depth in the nose. Happily the aspect of the grapefruit that comes through most in the taste is the bitterness as opposed to much fruit. The combination works well againast a pretty strong backbone.



Beautifully balanced, this is one of my favorite tasting beers. The ABV makes is just about sessionable too. A few pints of this after work would suit me just fine, too bad The JT is not very convenient for Atlanta, GA, USA!"

I suspect that this beer is going to be horribly misuderstood in the USA. People without the knowledge or experience of an ENGLISH IPA will think that this is just too light and not hoppy enough. The mistake that they will be making is that the English (original) version of the IPA is always going to be more balanced and understated, without feeling the need to shove the hops down your throat.



Orange pour with some scant lacing and a disappointing lack of head. Not the best looking beer I've ever seen. Simple malt and hop balance in the nose and the taste. Biscuit flavors in the background. Mild citrus peel and zest make up the bitterness, and as expected not a huge hop profile.



Too me this is amazingly drinkable, beautfully balanced, tasty and sessionable. I bet many will get it wrong and slam this beer for being something that it is not supposed to be."

Sweet, grassy aroma that is true to the beers advertised organic pedigree.



Subtle and well crafted beer, a rare combination.



Some mild hop bitterness all the way through the drink. This has great potential as a session beer.

St. Peter's does it again with this beautifully flavorful yet light beer. This is beer gives a combo which I find so difficult to find. A real tasty, hoppy, perfectly balanced brew that feels truly refreshing and drinkable.

I love this bottle, it looks like there is medicine inside, and frankly I felt better after I had consumed the contents!
It poured a beautiful chocolate brown with a dense, creamy head that fades to a very attractive spotty, creamy thin layer for the remainder of the glass. This beer is complex and smooth with an exceptional mouthfeel. I think it gives the perfect combination of stout creaminess and ale taste. The heaviness of stout is missing, but it still provides the smoothness associated with some of the best stouts.
I see from a number of other reviews the many BA's don't consider this brew heavy enough to be called a ""proper"" Porter. That may well be the case, but nevertheless this is a magnificent drink. I guess I'm not really a ""proper"" Porter fan, more of a fan of ""pseudo"" Porters, but this brew struck the exact right balance of ale and stout for me. Delicious!"

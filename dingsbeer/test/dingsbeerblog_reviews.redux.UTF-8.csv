BrewDog,Bashah,,,American Black Ale,8.60%,bottle,3.08,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,4/10/2011,"12 oz bottle.
Batch 352 which I think says 12/19/10 as the bottled on date, but I bought this way before that so that cannot be correct. My suspicion is that is a best before date. Anyway...
Black pour with some brownish highlights. Not much head, very little lace, but it settles to give a spotty, creamy film on the surface.
Nose offers plenty of hop character, and it is typically aggressive for the style and the two breweries involved. 
That carries forward to the taste where the hops could be described as medicinal. It's not so much a question of bitterness, but there is a distinct flavor of herbal charcoal note.
There is a creamy element to the beer which suggests a hoppy stout rather than something lighter.
Not bad, but not a beer or style that I ever likely to fall in love with."
Mad River Brewing Company,Steelhead Extra Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),5.60%,bottle,2.08,2.5,2,2,2.5,2,4/9/2011,"12 oz stubbie bottle. Blue label that is different to the picture in the BA db. As a single form Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour is a tad disappointing as the beer sits somewhat lifeless with a classic macro look - no head, no retention, no lace and a golden body. Color is fine, carbonation is not. Head is particularly disappointing to me.
Nose and tastes give a distinct vegetal sweetness and a malty experience that feels musty and old. No date on the bottle that I can see, so who knows? Finish lingers a little, but not really ina manner that one would want. Feels 'stale', but with no dating how are we supposed to know. Maybe this is a fresh bottle that always tastes like this!
This is quite a dry beer, but that doesn't save it from being a really lackluster effort. I'm not sure if it's the age of the beer or it's general lack of appeal, but it fails to satisfy on a number of levels.
Quite poor."
Capital Brewery,Supper Club Lager,,,American Pale Lager,5.00%,can,2.1,2,2,2,3,2,4/8/2011,"12 oz metallic looking can. Thanks go out to Kevin for the chance to have a crack at this one.
Any wispy head that was there on the initial pour dies really quickly above a fizzy looking, golden colored body. Pretty poor looking.
No apparent nose, even on warming.
Tastes are the usual combo of vegetal sweetness, high carbonation and a malty blandness that is distinctive only in relation to its non-descript nature.
Not really much here that is too offensive, however it really only says macro swill, so...there you have it."
Steinhaus Brewing Co.,Mission St. Hefeweizen,,,Hefeweizen,4.70%,bottle,3.18,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,4/8/2011,"22 oz bottle from the Trader Joe's cheap and cheerful line. I have had some really good success with some of these budget brews, but there have also been one or two stinkers so it's always an adventure - let's see what we have here.
The beer goes into the 500 mL Tucher Weizen glass. It's color is definitely out of the ordinary for the style. It's deep, orangey copper which is a long way away from a typical, lemony yellow body. The head is good initially, and to be fair doesn't fade as badly as many other cheaper beers, and even produces a little lace and retention. The color is striking if for no other reason than it's a little odd!
Tastes do replicate some very mild banana notes but the beer lacks a cutting edge. It feels a bit bloated and buttery and does not give a serious, sharp tang. 
The finish threatens more Hefe character, and to be honest it does deliver a little more, but at the end it feels a bit flabby for the style.
Having said that I was still happy purchase; didn't expect a lot, so wasn't disappointed."
Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,Ovila,,,Dubbel,?,bottle,3.93,3,3.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,4/8/2011,"Corked & caged bottle with an unusual shape around the neck. Opens with a fearful pop with a button mushroom like cork - I suggest great care opening this one, but to be honest I would rather have it that way than without sufficient carbonation. Nice gun smoke.
Attractive reddish brown hue which seems less muddy than the usual Dubbel appearance which is a bonus. Having said that beer is a dreadfully disappointing head and it fades horribly. No lace, no retention - shame.
Light, alcoholic breadiness in the nose, but it's pretty muted.
The tastes are a very nice malty, lightly alcohol based fruitiness. I feels quite bready and has a little depth as well. A touch of caramelized raspberries in the back and the finish offers more of the alcohol soaked, marzipan based maltiness - very nice.
Tastes are the strong point here but the head retention is terribly poor."
De Scheldebrouwerij,Hop Ruiter,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,8.00%,bottle,3.7,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,4/7/2011,"So I've been eying this 750 mL bottle in the store for some time and assumed (from afar) that it would be a Belgian IPA (considering the name), but was a little surprised to see it in the BA db as simply a BSPA. Additionally it was reviewed in this months BA magazine and was given the moniker 'Belgian Strong Golden Ale'! Seems like the beer has a identity crisis. Either way I'm pretty confident that I know what this beer will taste LIKE, it really depends to what degree that the white pepper, spice notes, alcohol, Belgian yeast/candy and hop character kick-in, before we can assign it its rightful place on that particular sliding scale.

Into the Duvel tulip she goes.

A pretty deep orange gold color on the body with some really lovely head, lace and retention. Beer looks bright and lively.

Nose gives up a little bitterness but not a great deal.

The tastes are a confusing mixture of things for me. what I would call a threatening hop base and a lurking Belgian yeast note but neither really come to the fore with any force. There is also an underlying sweetness that makes me almost think 'tripel' for a second, but then that is snatched away too. There are plenty of surprising floral notes too, which all adds up to a crazy package. I don't dislike it, but at the same time it never really delivers one thing or another. It's not a Belgian IPA, nor is it a really clean BSPA, and in that respect to be honest it disappoints a bit.

In addition I like the alcohol in a beer of this style to bite a little more than it does here. Needs a dash more pepper or solvent bite.

A beer that really doesn't know what it is. Like I say, not unpleasant, but a beer that falls between several stools for me and slightly lets me down. I wanted to like this more. Shame."
Cigar City Brewing,Capricho Oscuro - Batch 2,,,American Strong Ale,?,bottle,4.08,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,4/3/2011,"12 oz bottle, many thanks go out to Steve for the chance to try this one.
On the neck label the Batch # (2), and the bottle count (205/450) are noted.
Pour is a dark, chestnut brown with quite a lot of sediment, a lovely rich, coffee colored head, some which brings with it some decent retention and lace.
Big 'ole which malty notes with some sherry and alcohol. 
Tastes reflect that, but come in with a bit more subtlety. The sherry and alcohol notes are reflected early, but then we get more chocolate character.
Body is a touch thinner than the style and the nose would suggest, but the shortcomings are not significant and still delivers a smooth feeling.
Interesting. A beer that seems to sit closer to a coffee-based, chocolaty porter or stout than an American Strong. Definitely low hop character for the style, and the mouthfeel doesn't match.
Interesting beer."
Ridgeway Brewing,Querkus Smoked Oaked Porter,,,English Porter,5.80%,bottle,3.93,4.5,4,4,3,4,4/3/2011,"The presentation of this beer certainly makes one think that this could be a Scandinavian beer - something about the name and the label. Had no idea this was a Ridgeway beer until I looked at the label very carefully.
A really pretty color on the pour with plenty of ruby red highlights throughout the beer. Conservative head but still gives decent retention and some nice lace. However, the color is the star in the appearance; quite exquisite.
Nose and tastes give a mild smokiness that permeates the air above the beer. The beer is quite sweet and the malts dominate. There's no doubt that this is a unusual beer. At first this is not a surprise to me since an English Porter will certainly be less aggressive and more subtle than the American version of the style, but that's not where this ends. In reality this beer is really more like a smoked Dark Euro lager than even an English Porter, and it does not feel especially rich or creamy, but it is a very tasty and drinkable beer. The smoke is really subtle, sweet and light and it works really nicely.
Mouthfeel is definitely light.
A little unusual, so if you can accept that it is definitely NOT an American Porter (that shouldn't be hard), and also that it's not a very typical English Porter either (less easy to accept), and take it for what it is, you'll probably enjoy it."
Port Brewing Company / Pizza Port,Shark Attack Double Red Ale,,,American Amber / Red Ale,9.00%,bottle,2.75,2.5,3,2.5,3,3,4/2/2011,"22 oz bottle, Arbor Place Beverage, Douglasville, GA, USA.
Very typical for the style, a cloudy and turbid brown soup like affair with some big, rocky, pitted, off-white head and lace. Retention is not great. It's a bit of an ugly looking beer for me.
Nose and tastes deliver typical big, hoppy alcohol notes, and there is the requisite dry finish. 
Strangely, the alcohol is fairly well hidden during the drink, but in the aftertaste and at the end the beer packs its' full punch. The combination of the dry character (good) and the somewhat overbearing alcohol (bad), make this a one and done beer for me.
Not a bad example, but it's too aggressive for me and I found it a bit muddled and lacking focus."
Russian River Brewing Company,Sanctification,,,American Wild Ale,6.50%,bottle,4.45,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,4/2/2011,"375 mL bottle courtesy of Ross - many thanks. Batch 005.
Chilled this off perfectly and the medium pop on opening the corked & caged bottle produces some nice gun smoke. 
The head 'fizzes' up initially but of course it does not last and there is not much lace or retention. A very thin film of bubbles sit atop the beer.
The color is REALLY memorable. A very, very distinct lemon colored, yellow body. Super bright in terms of the hue and a stand out feature of the brew.
The nose is fresh and bright if somewhat predictable. Some apple notes and a little tart alcohol.
Tastes strike all of the right notes. Light, tart cider, citrus brightness and Brett fusion. Sharp and tart without lingering, the beer is clean. I really light the carbonation that seems perfect. It dances on the tongue and titillates but never gets prickly like beers of this type, can. As the beer warms I get a little more sweet character with some fruit coming through. Citrus. Green apples and gooseberries.
Overall a lovely, tasty beer which simply summarizes what RR does magnificently well."
Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company,Leinenkugel's Original,,,American Adjunct Lager,4.60%,can,3.15,3,3,3,3.5,3.5,3/31/2011,"12 oz can, many thanks to Kevin for the chance to try this American classic.
Pour gives lots of typical, American Adjunct Lager classic traits, but the body is a quite strange glassy affair with alarming clarity. As is son often the case the beer produces an initially very good head, but it fades very quickly and leaves no lace. Poor retention.
Nose is slightly vegetal but with no really offensive notes.
Tastes are much the same as the nose in terms of their neutrality and non-offensiveness but the lend a little more sweetness than the nose would have initially suggested. Bright carbonation leads to a refreshing, breaking crispness across the palate.
The beer feels clean to me which s definitely in its favor and a malty sweetness than I don't mind, but truth be told like so many other there really is no distinguishable or quantifiable 'taste' present other than the usual."
Cigar City Brewing,Jai Alai IPA - Papaya,,,American IPA,7.50%,bottle,3.83,5,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,3/26/2011,"750 mL bottle as part of a care package from Joey at the brewery. Many thanks.
Nothing on the label to suggest that this beer has Jai Alai as the base, but reading the reviews it apparently does.
The label is attractive and it suggests a fruity, rich experience is in store - that doesn't really happen for me.
Pour is a VERY attractive deep copper color with a high, fluffy head. The color is very rich and reminds me of one of those high def photographs that has that orange hue. The beer looks rich.
The aroma is also VERY strong. As soon as the cap is popped the beer starts to exude that pine notes associated with Jai Alai.
Unfortunately there is a fairly strong solvent alcohol taste that comes with the beer which to be honest, overwhelms any fruit character for me. I get VERY little fruit here at all, and it feels largely like a pretty standard, aggressive American IPA. Lots of bitter metallic notes which is OK, but it still leaves me craving a tropical fruit splash.
This is one pretty beer, and it's OK, but I would have LOVED a whole bunch of luscious fruit to come through in the taste; it just doesn't so in that respect a bit of a miss. Perhaps the label misled me a bit, and I felt slightly disappointed."
Jailhouse Brewing Company,Midnight Special India-Style Black Ale,,,American Black Ale,10.00%,bottle,4.45,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,3/26/2011,"So, I had heard about the new limited, special series that Glenn at Jailhouse was going to release and this one popped up at Green's on Buford yesterday. $8.99 for the large (bomber like) bottle.
Part of the new, Solitary Confinement Series; Cool! Not sure that I understand the label with the train bearing down on the convict in his bed, but, hey...whatever!
The pour is a very rich looking, dense, totally black affair that pours with a real, 'gloop, gloop' noise as it comes out of the bottle. Heady is creamy.
The nose gives some light hops and is restrained, and balanced.
Tastes? OK, let's cut directly to the chase here - for ALL intents and purposes this is mildly hoppy, very creamy stout. It's VERY tasty, but if you come here looking for a typical (in so much as one can achieve for the newish style) Black India Ale then you may get a jolt.
Mild hops are the key with a REALLY creamy feel. Malt sweetness is VERY well represented too, and as is the case with ALL Jailhouse beers, this brew is finely balanced and not aggressive. A very large amount of dry chocolate character for me too, but it's not a dry cocoa or bakers chocolate - rather its a much richer, more milk chocolate like taste on my palate. The hops are present but at the same time they are definitely a backseat presence. They manifest themselves more in the finish and aftertaste rather than up front but even then they are countered with plenty of sweetness. The creamy feel is maintained throughout the beer for me.
Look, I have to be honest here. When I heard about the Jailhouse special series I was VERY excited. Then, when I saw the first one had ""India-Style Black Ale"" on the label I was really disappointed (NOT my favorite style, and I was worried about bandwagon jumping). However, when I cracked the bottle and drank the beer, I found that this was essentially a lightly hopped, really creamy, well-balanced stout so I had no need to worry.
Good grief, Glenn is making some superb beer, and if you ignore the style designation, this is another. Wow!"
North Peak Brewing Company,North Peak Siren Amber,,,American Amber / Red Ale,5.00%,bottle,3.23,3.5,3,3,4,3.5,3/26/2011,"12 oz stubbie bottle as depicted in the BA db, thanks go out to Kevin for the chance to try this one.
Pour produces some nice sticky, white lace on top of a slightly murky, brown body. Not really very interesting to look at but at the same time the head is decent, produces some nice lace and is somewhat well retained.
Nose offers little other than some sweet malts.
The tastes are fairly ordinary with a few hoppy hints amongst the fairly dry, average malt base. Drinks easily and has good carbonation for the style. 
No groundbreaking moments here, just a solid, domestic version of a style that lacks much definition or character. Probably best sourced close to its home, very fresh and perhaps even on-tap."
21st Amendment Brewery,Bitter American,,,American Pale Ale (APA),4.40%,can,3.58,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,3/25/2011,"OK, let's be clear, at 4.4% this is NOT a session beer. Right, now we've got that out of the way, back to the beer itself.
12 oz can, many thanks go out to Beejay for the chance to try this one.
Pour is a deep gold color with a pretty spectacular head (if somewhat light), but the lace is very good. Nice retention.
The carbonation seems a touch on the high side.
VERY strong hoppy aroma which is frankly a bit surprising. 
The hops threaten a bit at the start of the beer but never really amount to the threat of the burst that came in the nose when the ring-pull was first broken. There's a light, floral touch about the beer but the carbonation is not in check enough to make the beer really reach its potential. Prickly feel is a bit annoying to me and take away from the overall experience.
Pretty tasty, but I'd enjoy a little more malt presence to back up the green hops, and of course the use of the word 'session' on the can is simply factually inaccurate, but it's still a tasty beer."
Cigar City Brewing,El Lector,,,English Dark Mild Ale,4.00%,growler,3.63,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3/25/2011,"32 oz growler courtesy of Joey as part of a care package from the brewery.
Beer pours a very cloudy, chocolate brown color with a very, very modest head. Lace is minimal. In stronger light the beer takes on more orange hues. Does look especially attractive, but having said that a great Mild is seldom a stunning looker, so there is a degree of authenticity about that!
Nose is a very nutty affair - noticeably so in fact. Surprising. If this were a blind taste taste I would guess that this was a brown ale with nut character of some description. As the beer warms, the nutty character seems to morph into a yeast and nut combo.
The beer does not replicate the nutty character of the nose which frankly is a good thing, but is does leave a little residual in the back end.
The beer is simply balanced with a pleasing drinkability that goes down easily, but it seems a long way removed from an English Dark Mild to me. No sweat, I'm just delighted to get the chance to drink a well balanced, tasty beer that comes in at session strength - it is LITERALLY difficult to be able to do that these days in the US. For this, I am grateful, cheers CCB."
Fuller Smith & Turner PLC,Organic Honeydew,,,English Pale Ale,5.00%,bottle,4.03,4.5,4,4,4,4,3/25/2011,"500 mL bottle as depicted in the BA database. $3.99 from Green's on Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour is an impressive, bright golden color with some lovely clarity, good carbonation, a nice, tight white head with some good retention and lace. Attractive no doubt with some great depth of orange color in the golden hue. Nice.
The nose offers a little breadiness amongst the sweet malts and a a hint of toasty grains.
Tastes give more of the toasty grain character and a honey elements that is more on the clover and fragrant side of things rather than intensely sweet. A beer that is warm in character and gives subtle hints and notes that will escape many. The bread element never leaves, and this beer is one that is probably best suited to cooler months. Surprisingly hearty, filling and satisfying for a beer with a light touch.
Drinkable? Certainly, but I'd need to be in the mood for this. If I were, this is a beer that I could drink a lot of despite its non-session beer ABV."
21st Amendment Brewery,Monk's Blood,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,8.30%,can,3.05,3,3,3,3.5,3,3/24/2011,"12 oz single can from Mac's, Midtown, Atlanta, GA, USA as part of their new ""Pick/Mix a Four pack"" as opposed to the pick/mix a 6 pack.
The beer pours a hazed, reddish-copper color with some cream colored head that does not linger. Not much lace.
Nose gives up a little maltiness but to be honest it really is nothing to crow about. Some sweetness and a dash of alcohol but not much else, even on warming.
Tastes are pretty sweet which is OK for the style, but follows up with some significant bubble-gum that is a little grating. There is quite a lot of ester character with pineapple definitely in there, but the beer never really delivers that specific, Belgian yeast elements that I'm looking for. Alcohol is a touch solventy for me too.
I dunno I was expecting more I guess, as a beer I had heard a lot about and in one of my favorite style ought to excite me more than this did. I found it sweeter than it should be with not much subtlety or interest."
New Holland Brewing Company,New Holland Night Tripper,,,American Double / Imperial Stout,10.80%,bottle,3.53,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3/20/2011,"22 oz bottle from Brawley's, Charlotte, NC, USA.
Light foil on the neck of the bottle.
New Holland is one of the few brewers that get to NC but not to GA, so I generally pick up something from them every time I'm up in NC.
Inky black pour with a modest head. Some nice, then mocha film sit atop the black body. Carbonation is reserved but entirely appropriate.
Nose and tastes give a fairly significant sweet effect. Some alcohol and lots of dry chocolate in the finish. A little warmth but considering the ABV the beer is pretty drinkable and the alcohol is largely hidden.
Actually the whole package seems surprisingly light to me, especially in terms of the mouthfeel. No slickness or difficult coating of the mouth.
The biitterness is not really that evident until the aftertaste when a combination of very light charcoal, smoke, dry bakers chocolate and a touch more alcohol come together.
Smooth, relatively well disguised alcohol and a beer that is typical of the American version of the style. No t my favorite, but a solid 'B' for me."
Sprecher Brewing Company,Irish Style Stout,,,Irish Dry Stout,5.70%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,3/20/2011,"12 oz stubbie bottle as per the usual Sprecher presentation. Thanks go out to Kevin for the chance to try this beer.
The bottom line with Sprecher is that they produce some great examples of simple styles, that are generally under-appreciated outside of their immediate locale, and by America geeks in general.
Simple black body with a modest head.
The thing I like about both the nose and taste associated with this beer is that they both represent a VERY light, balanced profile that sits in a drinkability range which is accessible. The ABV, although it could be much lower, also adds to the drinkability, ad the beer is one that one can really attack as a satisfying DRINK as opposed to SIPPING!
Very light malts and a gentle bakers chocolate touch on the beer. Light in the mouth with a pleasing kiss of bitterness in the back end. Finish is dry as expected, but again it's perfectly balanced and only represents a subtle brush with that characteristic.
Impressive, tasty, drinkable and overall just a really pleasing beer. Not the first time that I've said that about Sprecher."
Wychwood Brewery Company Ltd,King Goblin,,,Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB),6.60%,bottle,4.53,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,3/20/2011,"Single 500 mL bottle from Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA , USA.
Superb color on the pour, giving a beautiful, garnet clarity that I seldom see these days. Color is deep and present. Head is to be frank, a little disappointing. Small, not well retained although the lace defies he lack of retention.
Nose and tastes give up a classic biscuit malt and a light touch which defines the style (at least in the bottle). Some hoppy notes are added to the alcohol which produce a nice balance of drying malts and satisfying digestive like tastes.
The beer fills a HUGE void in the USA for lovers of the style, and whilst we all know that the cask equivalent would blow this away, it still represents a solid offering that helps define a bottled version of the style.
Lovely weight, excellent balance and a beer that I will turn to time and time again (as long as I can get it).
Simplicity. Goodness. Balance. Class."
Minhas Craft Brewery,Huber Premium Beer,,,American Pale Lager,?,can,3.15,2.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,3,3/19/2011,"12 oz can, many thanks go out to Kevin for the chance to try this.
Retro style can which is attractive - good times.
Slightly hazed with a macro colored pour, the beer appears similar to a macro adjunct with perhaps a notch above in terms of color and head. lace and retention are still huge issues though.
Nose and tastes deliver a macro adjunct experience as well, but it is less sweet and offensive than many in a similar group. Fairly neutral in the final analysis, but not really offensive or too sweet. Clean beer with a lack of linger aftertaste or unpleasantness.
Carbonation seems appropriate and the beer does what it is supposed to. 
No more, no less here with a slightly sweet but non-offensive package that would work in a few, outdoor, summer situations."
Minhas Craft Brewery,Mountain Creek Classic Lager,,,American Pale Lager,5.50%,can,1.9,2,2,2,2,1.5,3/19/2011,"12 oz can thanks go out to Kevin for the chance to try this one.
The latest in a huge parade of Minhas mediocrity.
This time the pour gives a pretty serious initially head, but it collapses to give nothing in terms of lace or retention.
Body is a golden color with a disappointing lack of carbonation - weak to be honest.
Pretty offensive, sweet, grainy corn hits the nose and palate and never gives anything more than that. Vegetal notes and a more than average sweetness drives home the adjunct feel.
Not good, difficult to consume and typically Minhas. that adds up to a write-off for me. Blah. Belch. Meh."
Stone Brewing Co.,Stone Old Guardian BELGO Barleywine,,,American Barleywine,12.00%,bottle,4.03,4.5,4,4,4,4,3/18/2011,"22 oz bottle from The Beer Dispensary, Apex, NC, USA.
I approach this beer with a mix of trepidation, excitement and interest since I feel that it is likely to bring together two elements of beer that are usually at opposite ends of the enjoyment spectrum for , namely Belgian yeast and character at one end (the good), and aggressive, hoppy, high ABV American Barleywines at the other (the bad) - it promises to be quite the experience.
The pour is a VERY attractive, bright dark copper with some lovely clarity and a surprisingly good head considering the ABV. Lace and retention are also above average, certainly a good looking beer.
The Belgian character is evident immediately and I'm glad of that! It does manage to sustain the yeast notes throughout as well. Ultimately it DOES deliver the more harsh, hoppy, high ABV notes that one would associate with the regular version of OG, and that's OK with me even if it's not my preference.
The sugary alcohol clashes a little with the more subtle, Belgian nuance (and it's even worse when the hops crash in), but since the American influence seems to cut in very late in the beer, it does seem to 'work'. The lateness of that appearance helps the beer overall but it does significantly shorten the enjoyment of the backend and aftertaste and finish of the beer. In the end though, not too much lost.
It's definitely a little bit 'mad', and certainly in the Stone mold of beers that push limits but this is one that does work for me - others have not.
All in all it's clean, delivers at both ends of the spectrum and manages to keep the disparate, fighting influences if not exactly in harmony, at least at arms length. In the final analysis I found it surprisingly good."
Port Brewing Company / Pizza Port,Mongo,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,8.50%,bottle,3.28,3.5,4,3,3.5,3,3/17/2011,"22 oz bottle. $7.99 from Ansley Wine Merchants, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Heard a lot of buzz about this beer in the last couple of weeks as LA/Port has recently made it to GA. For some reason (not sure why) I was under the impression that this was going to be largely a draught offering, so I was a little surprised to find it in bottles.
Pour is an attractive hazy marmalade color with a large, three finger head but doesn't quite give the magnificent and sticky lace that such a good head should bring, and one that is often associated with the style. In that respect slightly disappointing in terms of the look.
The nose is big, green, resiny and has a 'whole-hop' type feel - quite aggressive.
The tastes (unsurprisingly) follow suit, but rather than bringing with them a tangerine or grapefruit fruitiness, the beer drives home even more bitter green pine. It lacks a sweet element for me, and that's no good in a DIPA for me.
All the elements are there for this to be a super west coast IPA, but the malt bill comes up WAY too short for me, and it's almost as if I needs a couple of spoonfuls of sugar mixed in to the beer or even a splash of sweetened grapefruit juice."
Olde Hickory Brewery,Imperial Stout,,,American Double / Imperial Stout,10.20%,bottle,4.08,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,3/16/2011,"2011 vintage, as a gift from Mike at Duckworth's. Most generous, many thanks.
22 oz bottle with some really thick gold wax on top. Ding and the wax go to battle for a few minutes before I manage to prise the cap off. Wax seal like affair has 2011 embossed into the wax.
Pour is the requisite black, inky body, but with a very well retained head and some nice, cappuccino, sticky mocha colored lace.
The mouthfeel is pretty silky without being remotely cloying at all. Very smooth even considering the style. 
Tastes reflect the style well, but it's quite sweet and mild. It's not that the honey actually shines through as a taste or even as a harsh sweetness, but it certainly significantly takes the edge off things - really rich and non-bitter.
There is a hint of hoppy character WAY in the back of the back end, but it is really not significant.
Alcohol is INCREDIBLY well hidden.
Tasty, very smooth."
Erie Brewing Co.,Presque Isle Pilsner,,,German Pilsener,4.20%,bottle,2.33,2,2,2.5,3,2,3/13/2011,"12 oz single thanks go out to Kevin for the chance to try this one.
Extremely pale color on the pour with a touch of haziness about it - not good for a Pils.
Carbonation seems low for the style too.
Weak vegetal notes, some dubious notes int eh nose and some funny dry bitterness in the finish.
Not a clean beer and it lacks all kinds of attributes that a solid Pils should have.
Perhaps better fresher and closer tot he source, but I'm not convinced of that and I'm not holding my breath."
Minhas Craft Brewery,Berghoff Rock River Red Ale,,,American Amber / Red Ale,?,bottle,1.85,1.5,2.5,1.5,3,1.5,3/13/2011,"12 oz single thanks to Kevin for the chance to try this.
What is this??
Expecting an Amber/Red of *some* description I get a honey-colored, slightly hazy beer that, apart from the big, fluffy head, appears to be a macro color.
The nose and tastes are SUPER sweet and grainy. I mean SWEET, even by my standards that can usually tolerate a lot of sweetness. There's a corny maltiness about the beer too. Metallic features amongst the vegetal notes. Some alcohol.
Strange, and if this is an Amber/Red then I am a Dutchman. ZERO out of five for the style, and pretty undrinkable to boot as well. The head is decent, retained to some extent and overs some watery lace, but utside of that this is fairly odd and virtually undrinkable. Nasty."
Port Brewing Company / Pizza Port,Wipeout I.P.A.,,,American IPA,7.00%,bottle,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3/12/2011,"Review #2600 on BA. On tap at Taco Mac, East West Connector, Austell, Atlanta, GA, USA. 16 oz pour.
The beer comes as a hazed, mid-orange pour with the emphasis on the cloudy nature of the beer. Quite 'dense' looking which is OK for the nice, two-finger head that forms, but less appealing in the body of the beer.
Typical, west coast, American IPA is the simple analysis here; large, piney, resinous grapefruit in the nose which intensifies on warming. More of the same in the tastes with perhaps a bit more sweet grapefruit than the nose would suggest. Simple aftertaste and a few hoppy burps - a good sign.
Alcohol quite well hidden.
Served too cold, this beer benefits from warming a bit and could do with a body that was less clouded. Apart from that it's a typical, solid, west coast example fo an IPA which is both good and bad - you get what they say you will get, but at the same time the beer could honestly be one of dozens and dozens of other beers - ultimately, OK, but largely forgettable and nondescript. I'm looking for something a bit 'cleaner' both in look and taste to give higher scores."
21st Amendment Brewery,Fireside Chat,,,Winter Warmer,7.90%,can,1.83,3,2.5,1.5,3,1,3/11/2011,"$1.65 for the 12 oz can from Green's on Buford Highway, Atlanta, GA, USA.
A reddish, thin looking body with some brown highlights at the extremities.
The head is richer than the body and leaves some nice, dense lace.
The beer has very little hint of being a Winter Warmer and frankly no winter spice element that I can detect. It drinks like a thin, acidic, slightly off brown ale that may be on the brink of developing a large infection. Some slight lacto elements, the beer is pretty poor under any guise, and a tragic Winter Warmer.
Too light in the mouth and a nasty acidic aftertaste pull the shambolic 'beer' together.
It's bad - period."
Raccoon Lodge and Brewpub / Cascade Brewing,Cascade Kriek Ale,,,Flanders Red Ale,7.30%,bottle,3.13,3.5,3,3,4,3,3/11/2011,"750 mL, corked & caged from Brawley's, Charlotte, NC. 2009 vintage, $19.99.
No hint of a pop on opening.
Pour gives some more head than I was expecting but no lace and only a thin film is left behind after a couple of minutes. The body is a light, chestnut brown color and lacks much hint of red that a few others seem to have mentioned.
Nose gives plenty of sinus clearing, fruity acidity - as expected.
Tastes reflect the nose but with a touch more aggression and more residual drying effects from the oak. I like the carbonation which seems to add some life to the beer. A bit higher than normal for the style, and it brings a touch of CO2 into the taste - I like that.
Pretty solid example although I think that there are beers that offer a lot more subtlety even within/considering the style. This lends a typical, in your face American approach which grates on me after a while. The acid is a bit all over the place, and crashes into me a little too much to suggest refinement.
Cherry elements are hardly present at all for me."
Big Boss Brewing,Angry Angel Kolsch,,,Kölsch,4.50%,bottle,2.38,1.5,3,2,3,2.5,3/10/2011,"12 oz single from The Beer Dispensary, Apex, NC, USA.
Kolsch? Nope.
Pour gives a cloudy, mid orange body with a large, frothy, fluffy off-white head that leaves some sticky lace.
The nose instantly gives a fairly significant blast of hops, and the tastes replicate some of the hop bitterness too. Also present is a large malt backbone which holds the whole thing together. Aftertaste is quite dry.
In a blind taste taste I would put this down as being an old, American IPA. It fails the 'look' test for a Kolsch and has very little resemblance to the style no matter how one cuts it.
Mediocre beer, atrocious Kolsch. Germans will be revolting."
De Leyerth Brouwerijen (Urthel),Urthel Saisonnière,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,6.00%,bottle,4.23,4,4,4.5,4,4,3/10/2011,"11.2 oz bottle.
Surprised to see this at The Beer Dispensary in Apex, NC, USA. Not an Urthel beer that I have ever seen in the US before.
Pour gives a pretty standard, honeyed, hazed, lemon color with a nice creamy white foam on top. Some nice lace as the beer sits in the Brasserie de l'Abbaye des Rocs goblet.
A significant, sweet earthiness permeates the nose of this beer right from the get go. Organic feel about the beer.
In typical Urthel fashion the tastes are a little reminiscent of a Belgian IPA with some significant bitterness and a little hoppy note in the finish. The hoppy bitterness breaks the white pepper bitterness open a touch, and *slightly* moves the beer to a different level from your typical Saison.
The aftertastes accentuates the soapy, hoppy bitter section but it never gets aggressive and always feels within, if somewhat prodding at the edges, of the style.
Tasty, and a touch off-beat for the style but for me it works well. Nice"
New Belgium Brewing,Le Terroir,,,American Wild Ale,7.50%,bottle,4.33,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,3/10/2011,"22 oz bottle.
Pour is a rich, golden color with good clarity but a few hints of hazy cloud. Head forms quickly, is small, light and fluffy and fades to yield no more than a thin film and next to no lace.
Nose is interesting. As well as the tart acidity that one is expecting, there is also a fleeting whiff/hintof the green-feel hops. However, this slips away quickly to give way to the acidity in the blink of an eye.
The tastes mirror the nose with the apple acidity barging past a minor hop kiss to yield a typical wild rather than one that flirts with any hop presence. Each mouthful tempts us with hops, but within a few seconds it's all gone, snatched away by a more classic, wild element. Puckering acidity in the initial tastes lets up to give a more manageable and somewhat familiar fruit acid as the beer warms and is is consumed.
A very nice example of a 'yet-to-be-well-defined' style with the tiniest of nods to the hops, but if you've EVER drunk a west country cider in the UK you've seen this ALL before. The similarities between this beer and the cider that I grew up with as a thirteen+ year old are inescapable and have extreme synergy. All the way from the puckering apple acidity, through the light, manure funk and into the first quenching, then drying mouthfeel, this beer is ultimately no more than an American version of a British classic and it owes its existence to a place, time and beverage that has gone before."
Triangle Brewing Company,Triangle Belgian Golden Ale,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,8.00%,can,4.23,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,3/10/2011,"Same beer as this review; http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/16186/38572/?ba=Ding but this time from the 12 oz can. Purchased at The Beer Dispensary in Apex, NC, USA.
Very much the same feel as before with the sweetness coming through as the main asset. This beer is sweet enough to be firmly in the Tripel category for me. You've GOT to enjoy some phenolic esters and a LOT of sweetness to get your head around this.
The color does seem lighter, clearer and more golden compared to the last review and it looks good.
Still very drinkable for me and the can does offer some more flexibility for some but not sure that it is necessary."
Ska Brewing Co.,Modus Hoperandi,,,American IPA,6.80%,can,3.9,4.5,5,3.5,4,3.5,3/9/2011,"12 oz can from the Beer Dispensary, Apex, NC, USA.
I've had this beer a few times before, but this is the first review.
There is absolutely no doubt that the nose that the beer generates is absolutely unique and extraordinary. A big, fat, green, fresh hop presence that lingers and is the highlight of the beer for me.
The copper colored, clear body gives a tremendously impressive head and a lot of sticky lace. Good signs.
Some metallic notes and plenty of bitterness that lingers and drives the beer into some dark territory. The beer is actually increasingly aggressive and doesn't let up much. Slight alcohol burn in the back end, finish and burn in the end. Plenty of resinous pine but lacks much grapefruit based sweetness. Quite harsh but paradoxically drinkable.
Hoppy burps ensue.
Hop heads dream, and aggressive, American, modern classic."
SweetWater Brewing Company,Sweetwater Dank Tank Mean Joe Bean,,,American Porter,8.50%,bottle,3.13,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,3/9/2011,"22 oz bottle in the usual Dank Tank presentation this time with a brown and yellow motif.
The pour is basically black with a few brownish highlights at the extreme edges.
Head is quite small and lacks any retention or lace, a little disappointing.
Nose has a surprisingly lack of coffee element and is mainly dominated by a malty, alcohol note.
The mouthfeel is very light which I suppose could be taken one of two ways. Either the beer is very drinkable and easy, or it lacks presence for a beer that with the ABV should really be an Imperial Porter. The tastes lack coffee for me and only replicates a simple alcohol based malt beer which does not have much presence. Meh...
I dunno, this comes up short for me in virtually all areas. It ought to have more depth, it ought to have more coffee, it ought to have more taste but it doesn't.
Frankly a bit disappointing, a bit light and a bit lazy for the type of beer it should be."
Brouwerij Kerkom,Bink Grand Cru,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,13.00%,bottle,4.93,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,2/26/2011,"750 mL bottle with a synthetic 'cork', silver foil and cage with black cap. Cork is wedged in pretty tight, it is a pain to open. Also, the lack of 'pop' and lack of gun-smoke is a little disappointing.
In anything other than bright light, the beer looks black. In stronger light the body is seen to be a shade or two lower getting into the very, very dark brown region with even a few red notes/highlights in the extremities.
Aggressive pour was required (at least by me, since I am a fan of creating some decent head on the beer). Tan head is short-lived and recedes to give a thin, spotty film on the surface. Considering the ABV, I can live with both the carbonation and the head, even if I would like them both to be more substantial.
Nose offers tremendous sweet malts, alcohol and a light licorice element. It permeates the room from the glass!
The licorice is carried forward into the tastes, but unlike some other, similar licorice elements in other beers this one offers a sugar coated experience with a lack of bitterness. The alcohol is definitely in the picture (and at 13%, why not?), and there is plenty of rum and raisin character that comes through.
Massive sweet marzipan, other almond tastes and further brown sugar, licorice and dark fruits collide quite violently on the tongue.
The aftertaste is that of a classic, English Barleywine with a barrage of even more alcohol and further light roasted caramel and a REALLY pronounced warming effect.
The mouthfeel offers some 'better than expected' prickliness and a paradoxically smooth (but more 'in character') middle and finish.
Look, this is a BIG beer in all respects, but it does manage to pull off a tremendous combination of attributes that are all within the style. It's NOT for the feint of heart, nor is it for those who do not like the classic dark fruit based, Belgian candy styles, or beers that are not sweet. However, if you ARE in that category (as I am), you're gonna love this. 
Considering the ABV, the beer is off the charts for drinkability.
Strap yourself in and hold on for dear life! WOW!"

Relatively new entrant to the Atlanta market. Th e pour gives a clear, copper colored body with a one finger head. Head is unfortunately poorly retained and there is virtually no lace. Color is pretty though.
I'm very surprised at the hoppy nature of the nose. It's quite striking under any circumstances, and considering the style that is even more amazing. The tastes also give up some of that hoppy element, but it's not quite as strong as the nose initially suggests.
The beer is quite clean and dry, and imparts a refreshingly metallic note. The bitterness builds quite substantially.
Not at all what I was expecting for the advertised style, and the beer combines an interesting combo of styles that sit somewhere between an IPA and dry, clean red/amber ale. It's very hoppy when considering the APA style."
Yo-Ho Brewing Company,Tokyo Black,,,American Porter,5.00%,can,3.28,4,3,3.5,3,3,2/26/2011,"12 oz can from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA, a little while ago.
Genuine import since the adhesive sticker that yields the Government warning obscures the original Japanese text that is printed on the can.
Black pour with a few red highlights, largely in keeping with the style. Head is not great, but sticky lace does suggest some quality.
Also in keeping with the style it lacks refinements and delivers an aggressive, watery feel without depth or creaminess. Bitter character comes through quite a lot and the beer drinks less easily than I would hope.
Bitter."
"Bell's Brewery, Inc.",Bell's Oarsman,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,4.00%,bottle,2.9,3,2.5,3,3,3,2/25/2011,"12 oz single from Ale Yeah, Decatur, Atlanta, GA, USA.
A very pale, hazy yellow pour with a pretty small head and little retention or lace.
Nose and tastes are citrusy and light, but lack any depth for me. It's not complex and beers of this ABV CAN BE! There are a few light (relative) sour notes.
It seems to me that Bell's are getting away with a little something here. They are filling a gap in the US market, but they are doing it with a beer that's not very good. However, the gap in the market make it looks better than it really is. It's a missed opportunity.
In the final analysis Oarsman is just a very ordinary beer, BUT the lack of American session beers has people elevating it beyond its station. It's really not very good. Shame."
Brauerei Heller-Trum / Schlenkerla,Aecht Schlenkerla Eiche,,,Doppelbock,8.00%,bottle,4.7,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,2/25/2011,"The usual Schlenkerla bottle shape, purchased from Green's on Ponce in Atlanta, GA, USA.
The pour is a particularly attractive, gold color with a moderate, white head. It looks really nice in terms of the color, but I would much prefer a bigger and better retained head. It lacks a little in that department, but the color is really superb. Very nice carbonation.
The nose delivers the usual Schlenkerla bacon smoke, but it seems more complex and layered than some of the other Schlenkerla beers. The oak smoke seems VERY intense, but paradoxically more subtle than some of the similar beers from the brewery. The oak clearly brings a different feel. The beer lingers too. 
Complex malts with plenty of sweetness to compliment the smoke. There is also a lingering bitterness that builds and as the beer is consumed it really feels mildly hoppy at the end - THAT, I wasn't expecting. Strangely, the ending also comes in sharply sweet. It also delivers a little bit of solvent like alcohol in the finale.
A VERY complicated beer for me with plenty of rich, layered and competing factors that compliment one another brilliantly. A tremendous experience for me. 
Like all of the Rauch's this is best paired with food and the sheer multitude of meats and cheeses that this could pair with is astonishing - perhaps even infinite!"
"August Schell Brewing Co., Inc.",Schell's Pilsner,,,German Pilsener,5.60%,bottle,2.6,1.5,3,2.5,3,2.5,2/24/2011,"12 oz single - thanks to Kevin for the chance to try this one.
Pour is a very odd color. It has a watery pale look, but also has a slightly bizarre hazed, wheat-like look. The head is not really of any consequence and there is a thin film of froth on the surface. No lace. The color is very disturbing to me - it looks both washed out and cloudy. Strange.
Nose has some dry, grainy alcohol and a little degree of sweet malt.
There is a hint of bitterness that permeates the beer (good), but it also delivers a paradoxical grain based, vegetal, corn sweetness. The alcohol (solvent) comes through in a bit, more in terms of taste than burn. 
I don't like this much, and the appearance is particularly bothersome. The tastes are not THAT bad, but at the same time Germans everywhere are afraid - very afraid."
Minhas Craft Brewery,Minhas 1845 Pilsner,,,German Pilsener,5.50%,bottle,2.03,2.5,2,2,2,2,2/24/2011,"12 oz bottle courtesy of Kevin.
The pour delivers a color that is darker and more orange than I would like to see from a Pils. It has a slightly hazed, copper tone and doesn't give a very clean appearance. The head is a quick, one finger affair but it disappears very swiftly. No lace.
Nose and tastes are at first watery and grainy, and then cut in with a huge dollop of sweetness. The sugar seems very artificial and quite chemical in its nature. The lack of body continually repeats itself.
Strange aftertaste and a weak experience. Minhas is producing a colossal amount of really poor beer - I suppose there must be a market for it, but I'm not part of that demographic."
Ale Asylum,Hopalicious,,,American Pale Ale (APA),5.80%,bottle,2.35,4,3,2,2.5,2,2/20/2011,"Many thanks go out to Kevin for the opportunity to sample this beer.
12 oz single. At first glance, from the general appearance and more obviously from the name, it seemed to me as though this was going to be some huge, American DIPA that would be a real plate abuser. On closer inspection it reveals that the beer is not supposed to be that at all, and it's just a swell since it did not appear especially hoppy at all. In fact, the name was somewhat ironic in both the respect that it was not notably hoppy OR delicious!
Anyway - the pour is a hazy, deep orange with a nice white head that looks pretty good. if the truth be told, the best aspect of the beer is to be found by simply looking at it, the rest is somewhat downhill from there.
A few notes of bitterness are backed up by a weakish malt base and a lack luster mouthfeel. Somewhat watery I thought, and the beer lacked much depth or presence. Grainy alcohol comes through a bit amongst the sweetness, but overall there's nothing of any substance to report.
Finish leaves me wanting something else, as the tastes fade in an alarming manner. Compare this to a run of the mill American Pale like Sierra Nevada's and it fares even worse."
"August Schell Brewing Co., Inc.",Lakemaid,,,American Adjunct Lager,4.50%,bottle,2.9,3,2.5,3,3,3,2/20/2011,"12 oz single from Kevin, thanks mate.
Pour offers a slightly hazed yellow body and an aggressive dispensing yields a pretty decent head if truth be told. Obviously little retention and/or lace, but not bad considering everything.
Nose and tastes do no more than a beer of this style and nature should. A sweet, grainy, vegetal note with limited bitterness and weak malts.
Mouthfeel is average for the style and the beer delivers a thoroughly underwhelming experience pretty much across the board.
Slightly strange aftertaste that has some lemon or other citrus, but the total package is still pretty light on any kind of flavor or character.
Ho hum; it is what it is and not a drop more."
Clipper City Brewing Co. / Heavy Seas Beer,Heavy Seas - Siren Noire Imperial Chocolate Stout,,,American Double / Imperial Stout,8.00%,bottle,2.98,2.5,3,3,3,3,2/20/2011,"I believe that the latest batch of Siren Noire (late 2010/early2011) came out a few weeks ago, but this review is from a bottle that is just over 12 months old.
22 oz presentation in the usual, Heavy Seas Mutiny series bottle.
I have been generally VERY disappointed with the Heavy Seas range of Mutiny beers over the last couple of years so i have had my expectations lowered considerably.
Pour is a requisite dark brown, but fails to reach strong levels of black at any point in the glass. Quite a small head, not much retention or lace. Generally disappointing to look at.
The nose here is quite weak, and the tastes follow suit. Sure there are chocolate notes and some bitterness amongst those roasted malts, but the overall package feels quite weak to me. This of course may be a function of age, but it ought to be able to stand up to some cellaring - maybe not. Some dark chocolate powder (cocoa), but it feels washed out and lacks maltiness. Weak.
Mouthfeel lacks richness and the beer feels light to me. Not a good sign for the style.
Disappointing. Weak."

This is a beer with some presence. I like it a lot.
The pour looks substantial with a heavy, copper colored body and some really nice, thick white head.
Nose and tastes deliver some substantial, malts that are nicely complimented with a decent splash of bitterness. The hop profile is noticeable and definitely brings a presence that is unusual for the style, AND gives more punch than a beer with this kind of ABV would be expected to deliver.
The bitterness lingers longer than i would think it would as well, and with it comes a satisfying feeling of alertness. This beer is one to be reckoned with on a number of levels and I like it very much. A little soap in there too.
Good punch, a beer than delivers nicely. Ballsy for the ABV."
French Broad Brewing Co.,Anvil Porter,,,American Porter,6.00%,on-tap,3.98,3.5,4,4,4,4,2/20/2011,"On Tap at Taco Mac, Prado, Sandy Springs, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Nice to French Broad bringing out a new product.
Requisite black pour but with a somewhat poor head - maybe as a result of some dodgy Taco Mac barstaff, but not sure.
Pretty standard fare here. Light roasts sit throughout the nose and tastes and deliver a mild charcoal amongst the sweet malts. Well balanced and somewhat less aggressive than many American versions of the original, this beer delivers a fair bit of sweetness and most important to me, a nice creamy mouthfeel that is sometimes missing in American Porters.
Goes down easy and satisfies with simplicity.
Drinkability is pretty good, and a beer that couple with a sensible ABV is a porter that could be consumed in larger quantities. Went well with the cooler weather and a hearty dinner."
Jailhouse Brewing Company,Mugshot IPA,,,American IPA,6.70%,on-tap,4.58,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,2/20/2011,"Wow, I really, really, really like this beer.
Pour is a mid-orange/copper with nice clarity, a little chill haze and a head that although present, could be better - HOWEVER, I watched the barstaff at Taco Mac pour this, and know that they did not do a good job so I suspect I could get a better appearance than they managed.
Nose and tastes are SUBTLE! Imagine that! Very light fruits with some subtle, sweeter fruits like peaches, but a healthy dose of sweetened grapefruit giving the true IPA moniker. Very easy to drink, and a beautifully balanced IPA that will not assault your taste buds, rather it will caress them.
Gentle, appropriate carbonation, and despite the poor pour, a good amount of lace on the glass. Finish gives a kiss of more bitterness and a lingering fruity feel. Some hoppy burps, too.
Delicious beer that restores my faith is beautifully, gentle, crafted beer with a subtle and non-aggressive edge. Delightful"
Maumee Bay Brewing Company,Buckeye Beer,,,Czech Pilsener,5.20%,bottle,2.08,2.5,2,2,2.5,2,2/20/2011,"12 oz single courtesy of Kevin.
For a beer that has a Czech Pils moniker, it has a heck of a lot of adjunct lager character!
Head retention is pretty weak and the beer delivers a nose that is chocked full of vegetal sweetness.
The aroma characteristics are somewhat 'bothersomely' repeated in the tastes and frankly they do not improve much. The nagging sweetness replaces what should be a dry, clean, bitter Saaz bite in the finish, and the beer generally under performs horribly for the style, and frankly doesn't do any more than just that.
In a blind taste test I might have simply seen this as no more than a nasty, American adjunct."

Pour is an encouraging, reddish brown affair with some nice clarity and good, attractive highlights when the light catches it correctly. The head is a little small, quite poorly retained and lacks much lace, so the good work provided by the color is unfortunately undone almost immediately. Shame.
The carbonation seems a touch low.
A malty beer with fairly simple caramel and sweet characteristics without getting complicated. However, it does seem really light in many important areas including tastes depth, nose and satisfaction/mouthfeel. I was initially encouraged by the sensible ABV, and I do like a good bock, but this seemed to lack depth and the German yeast components that are essential to such a beer.
Has the potential to be good, but ultimately it misses on most fronts. Disappointed, as I really wanted (and tried) to like this much more. As far as Minhas goes this is NOT their worst effort by some distance, but in the end it's still pretty poor."
Minhas Craft Brewery,Berghoff Prairie Lager,,,German Pilsener,?,bottle,1.38,2.5,2,1,2,1,2/20/2011,"12 oz single, from Kevin - many thanks.
Oh dear, this is not very good at ALL! I like the label and the general appearance of the bottle, it's a shame that this is by far the best aspect of this particular beer! Should i eat the label instead of drinking the beer?
To be fair the beer does pour with a Pilsener appearance in terms of color, carbonation and clarity, but the head is woeful and the lace non-existent.
The tastes and nose are INCREDIBLY sweet, even for my sweet tooth and obviously horribly out of place in a Pils. The Germans would be horrified by this I feel. It's got macro adjunct written all over it - straw colored, vegetal, corny tastes mingle amongst the overpowering sugar rush. Pretty much undrinkable in the final analysis.
German Pils? Good grief!"

Pour offers a strangely red tinge to the beer with plenty of white head. The color goes beyond amber and to another level. 
Nose offers little, but the tastes do deliver a touch more that I was expecting. Some light acidity on the malts and a light dry character that no-one is calling 'hoppy', but on the other hand does deliver a certain non-sweet note.
Ordinary? Sure, but a beer that doesn't leave me unhappy, if at the same time doesn't thrill. The mouthfeel and depth of character are lacking somewhat, but at the same time it's not a complete disaster."
The Matt Brewing Company,Saranac Rye Pilsener,,,Rye Beer,4.80%,bottle,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,2/20/2011,"12 oz single, thanks to Kevin for the chance to try this.
Rye beers (of any description) are not really my thing so I approach this with a degree of trepidation. 
the beer pours as a totally clear, golden straw color with a small, white head. Carbonation is decent and leaves a touch of lace.
With the combo of pale malts and, hops and rye, the beer does deliver a clean-cut edge with a degree of bitterness up front. However, this beer is not really deep. Finish is short and dry (good), but lacks much presence. The rye bitterness builds a bit and is an interesting alternative to a noble hop bitterness but never fully replicates it,
A little graininess to it, and a beer that although not sweet per se, seems sweeter than it should be for the type of brew that it is.
No complaints here since the beer delivers a refreshing experience, but in no way is this a beer that is memorable or lingers on the palate. OK, I suppose, but still leaves me saying, ""ho hum"" a bit. Wouldn't turn down a few in the height f summer, but never a beer that I would seek out again."
The Matt Brewing Company,Saranac Amber Wheat,,,American Dark Wheat Ale,4.80%,bottle,3.4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,2/20/2011,"12 oz bottle as a single from Kevin. Thanks mate.
The beer pours with a lovely, dark golden color with a decent white head that leaves a little lace. There is a touch of haze to the beer which seems appropriate for the style.
Nose offers very little outside of some weak malts and a little grain.
Tastes are quite dry with a short finish. Plenty of pale malts with the faintest kiss of hop bitterness in the final flourish. More dryness in the aftertaste. The malts have a little biscuit nature about them, which is nice, but to be honest the beer drinks a little watery and lacks a real depth of mouthfeel. Some light caramel.
Sensible ABV adds to the drinkability for me.
Drinkable and OK, but this is not a beer that I'm going to seek out again."
The Matt Brewing Company,Saranac Helles,,,Munich Helles Lager,4.80%,bottle,3.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,2/20/2011,"12 oz single courtesy of Kevin.
A good clean, bright (appropriate) pour with a head head that is not especially well retained or leads to much lace.
Carbonation is good amidst the golden, clear body.
Some light, peppery spice on the aroma and tastes that also lend a degree of bitterness. Sharp and clean, the beer gives away its sharp roots with a combination of dry, stinging bitterness. This is by no means the harshest of the style I have had, not does it deliver the real sting of solid Saaz (or other noble) 'bite', but it definitely captures the genre quite nicely.
Happy to have tried this. Saranac by Matt is a funny range of beers since there is seldom anything that stands out, but you can usually get some good value and decent beer in the style. This is one of their better efforts for me."
Great Divide Brewing Company,Grand Cru,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,11.00%,bottle,3.03,3.5,3,3,3,3,2/19/2011,"22 oz bottle with the usual, Great Divide presentation. Red foil on this one.
Dark copper, garnet colored body with good clarity and a small, off-white head. In the Chimay chalice the beer leaves some decent lace and a thin, creamy spotty head on the surface of the beer.
The nose is where things get interesting to say the least. There is some sweetness that I was expecting, but there is also a dose of some hop character. 
The tastes are also pretty odd. There's a lot of sweetness, but not really a lot of fruit character or Belgian yeast notes. The lack of yeast is areal disappointment. Plenty of syrupy alcohol and again, a strange, out of place hoppiness. This beer drinks like a HUGELY sweet IPA. It's extremely odd. There's also an odd smokiness to the beer, too.
Don't come here looking for a typical BSDA, this isn't it, rather it's a strange combination of sweetness and a thinnish IPA with a bit of smoke in the mix.
ODD, and not to my liking really and unrecognizable in the style."
Terrapin Beer Company,Terrapin TomFoolery,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,7.30%,bottle,3.65,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,2/17/2011,"22 oz bottle, $7.99, #14 in the Side Project series.
I'm immediately put on the defensive by the idea of a 'Black Saison'; as a traditionalist and a person that really loves a great Saison this doesn't really fill me with a lot of inspiration or hope. 
Jet black body with a small, creamy head.
Some nice lemony, citrus notes in the nose, and a simple replication in the tastes. Some nice, sharp orange peel and a few light spices and white pepper in there too. Very, very minimal roastiness (which I am glad about), but then again why use the dark malts?? There's a decent dose of bitterness, but it's based in saison tartness and a light spicy nature rather than a roasted element. I don't get much rye either, which for me is also a good thing.
A smooth creaminess in the mouth comes with the fine bubbles.
Although I enjoyed the beer somewhat, I really don't see the point of use use of the dark malts. They really don't bring a significant roast character, and since they don't do that, why not just brew the beer with a more traditional grain bill? It comes across as gimmicky, i.e. a stunt to make something 'different' - that bothers me a little."
Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company,Big Eddy Russian Imperial Stout,,,Russian Imperial Stout,9.50%,bottle,3.58,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,2/16/2011,"12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour is a nice looking one, with all the requisite attributes for the style, plus some really nice alcohol legs. Head and lace are not amazing, but solid.
Nose is pretty strong, but mainly in alcohol and little else. Usually that's not a good sign but this particular aroma sits OK with me.
Very light in the mouth which adds to the drinkability. The beer is a collection of maltiness wrapped inside more alcohol. Obviously some roastiness but very little harsh bitterness. There are a few notes of various chocolates (both dark & light), and the beer comes together rather well.
Quite an easy drinker and light in the mouthfeel, but the beer does give a very significant alcohol taste and delivery.k"
Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),Infinium,,,Bière de Champagne / Bière Brut,10.30%,bottle,3.35,4.5,4,3.5,2.5,2.5,2/13/2011,"Elaborate bottle that I acquired for the somewhat bargain basement price of $16.99. Delighted to get it for that kind of money since there seems to have been a very mixed reception for this beer.
Poured into the champagne flute, the appearance lives up the style with a hazed, darker than one might expect, peachy, golden body and a hugely effervescent head.
The nose offers a dry, acidic alcohol aroma that is promising.
The tastes on the other hand are nowhere near as dry as I was expecting, and give (in parts) quite a lot of sweetness and apple taste. The beer also comes across with quite a heavy handed syrupy feel and is nowhere near as dry as I was expecting or hoping. In fact, the beer is really quite viscous and not easy to drink.
A beer in this style would need to be WAY drier, crisper, lighter and less sweet if I were to go near it again. I didn't dislike it as such, but this beer is far too laborious for the style and couple with the alcohol is quite a big effort.
Not an easy beer, and I've had many better in the style and it seems as though these two brewers ought to have come up with a better beer. At $16.99 I wasn't happy with the price, at a higher price point I would have been increasingly annoyed."

Lake Placid Pub And Brewery,Ubu Ale,,,American Strong Ale,7.00%,bottle,3.65,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,2/12/2011,"I had a few of these fro the first time back in the Summer of 2010, but this review is from a 12 oz bottle.
Pour is a dark brown with blackish, red highlights and a resplendent, high, mocha colored frothy head. Head retention and lace are both very good.
An extremely solid, malty nose suggests depth, and a lot of it.
Tastes don't quite deliver what the nose suggested, but still give a hearty malt based beer with some alcohol and a decent dose of bitterness. A tiny amount of oxidized, sweet liquor character that I was not expecting. Finish has more malts and the beer feels quite filling and expansive.
This is a beer that whilst although not heavy, certainly has some depth and delivers a malty experience that others in the style shy away from. Sort of a cross between a Wee Heavy and an American Strong, the beer is much more subtle than some American versions and brings plenty of malt to the table.
Interesting."
Les Trois Mousquetaires,Série Signature Kellerbier,,,Keller Bier / Zwickel Bier,5.50%,bottle,3.58,5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,2/12/2011,"750 mL corked & caged bottle. Opens with a decent pop. Arbor Place Beverage, Douglasville, GA, USA.
Hazy, butterscotch orange pour with a splendid head. The head is very ice-cream like, and threatens to be almost solid. Thick white density with retention to match. Great looking beer.
Nose gives a characteristic musty, rye note which is carried into the taste. The tastes give quite a bitter, peppery note that lacks the charm or fruitiness of a beer like a Saison, or the sweetness of a Tripel, two styles that also offer some pepper. This seems more black pepper than white pepper.
Not a style I care for a lot, but this did look fantastic and offered a pretty nice drink, but the musty character lingers a little and it's what turns me away from these beers a bit."
New Belgium Brewing,Lips Of Faith Dunkel Weiss,,,Dunkelweizen,9.00%,bottle,4.45,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,2/12/2011,"22 oz bottle, the usual Lips of Faith series presentation from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour gives a lovely black color (in poor light), but a more traditional brown based beer in better light. The head is tight, and mocha in color with a nice amount of retention and lace considering the ABV.
The worry with the ABV of 9% is that the solvent alcohol may begin to take over the beer and rob it of its normal style characteristics. Fortunately it doesn't, and the beer delivers all of the requisite banana, bubblegum and alcohol sweetness that one would expect. Lots of repeated waves of estery, fruitiness and a solid warmth from the alcohol in the finish.
All in all nicely put together, and the beer drinks very well.
Another tasty beer in the series."
"August Schell Brewing Co., Inc.",Schell's Bock,,,Bock,6.10%,bottle,3.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,2/9/2011,"12 oz single, thanks go out to Kevin for the chance to try this one.
Pour is a slightly reddish brown, with some good clarity, a smallish head that is not retained all that well and does not really give much lace.
The nose and tastes combine to yield a very nice malty, alcohol flavor that is compact and fairly short without fuss. The beer is pretty light with a straightforward approach that delivers a bready finish and some simplicity and depth that is uncommon. Robust, perhaps a little nutty and definitely yeasty, the alcohol pops in for a brief appearance in the final flourish too.
Nice beer in the style which pleases me but may be a little too simple for some."
Cigar City Brewing,Improvisación Oatmeal Rye India-style Brown Ale,,,American Brown Ale,9.00%,bottle,1.88,3,2,1.5,3.5,1.5,2/6/2011,"Given to me as a gift from a well-known bar owner. Many thanks.
750 mL capped bottle. Not really sure what a Oatmeal, Rye, India Brown Ale is, but...
Opening produces a HUGE gusher - not a trivial amount of beer lost, in fact around one third of the total contents are lost on the kitchen counter. Makes me think 'infection' or a best 'over-carbonated', we'll see.
The pour gives a frankly UGLY, chocolate brown color to the body that looks like viscous med - totally opaque. The head is obviously very good, well retained, a coffee-color and gives some nice lace. In that respect the beer looks good, but the color is just pain UGLY. An immediate paradox in the appearance.
The nose gives an acidic twang and some blue cheese. This makes me think Brett or infection.
The tastes reflect the nose and offer an acidic, light, blue cheese note and not much else. Funk is all over the place and the sour note persists through the beer, or at least the amount I can get down before drain pouring the rest of the bottle.
Disappointing."
Mad River Brewing Company,Jamaica Red Ale,,,American Amber / Red Ale,6.50%,bottle,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,2/6/2011,"12 oz bottle as a single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA. Different label than the one in the BA db.
A slightly hazed, mid-brown pour sits underneath an off-white medium sized head and produces some better than average lace.
Nose dives up some dry hop notes.
Tastes are in line for the style and combine a decent hop and malt balance with the requisite dry finish. Aftertaste lingers to give some more residual hoppiness which is appropriate. Some mild alcohol burn in the back end and finish. The lingering bitter note is actually quite nice as it reminds you of the tasty beer you have just consumed.
A straightforward beer that showcases the style quite well without frills or drama. Decent beer."

Color is a surprisingly dark body with a smallish head. Minimal retention, minimal lace.
Carbonation seems better than average.
Nose and tastes give a disappointingly watery feel. Some light malts but the beer is overall grainy and does not produce any significant taste. Ultimately it is a very sweet beer and it does not give anything else. Blah.
Poor beer without interest, frankly."
New Glarus Brewing Company,Fat Squirrel Ale,,,English Brown Ale,5.80%,bottle,2.8,3.5,3.5,2.5,3,2.5,2/6/2011,"12 oz single, thanks to Kevin for the chance to try this one. Always delighted to try a New Glarus beer, and this is no exception.
Pour provides a body that is quite clear and has a reddish-copper pour with a somewhat small head. Not much retention or lace.
Good malty nose, but unfortunately the nose does not really translate into much depth in the taste. Quite honestly, it tastes really quite weak. This is disappointing to me because if this were a really good example of an English Brown Ale it would have a lot more malty depth, and this does not. Even a little watery.
A tiny nut element and perhaps a modicum of smoke as well - shocking.
I dunno, I just expect more of NG, in a style that I thought that they might pull off, but it ended in a disappointing manner for me. Shame, an opportunity missed for me."
The Matt Brewing Company,Saranac Pomegranate Wheat,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,4.70%,bottle,2.7,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,3,2/6/2011,"12 oz single, many thanks to Kevin for the chance to try this one.
Pour gives a peach colored body with some light, wispy head. Lace is minimal but nevertheless it is present.
Nose offers some light, acidic fruit but little else, even on warming.
Tastes are surprisingly neutral. I was expecting EITHER a blast of fruit, or a blast of wheat and in the end got neither! There is a little, light fruit acidity that the nose promises but it never gets significant and the wheat never manifests itself either.
I guess I wasn't expecting much and the beer delivers just about that much! Unoffensive but largely devoid of significant depth of flavor or character. Summer drinking? Maybe, but outside of that this beer is not likely to cut it for many people."
Great Divide Brewing Company,16th Anniversary Wood Aged,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,10.00%,bottle,3.55,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,2/5/2011,"When this came out, rumor had it that this was exactly the same beer as the 15th anniversary. I have no idea about the validity of that statement, and it wound up in the BA db as a different beer anyway, so here goes.
The bottle has silver foil on the 22 oz neck. An aggressive pour produces a slightly hazed, mid-orange body and gives a lovely, dense, creamy white head. Looks a little like a latte floating on top of the beer.
Nose has a little soapiness (which I like), but it never gets strong. I would not have guessed that this beer was based upon Denver Pale Ale, but the label confirms.
The tastes are essentially a residual sweet, lightly woody, viscous sugary affair with some hop resin residuals as well. The alcohol is very well hidden and the sweetness (somewhat surprisingly) never gets very large. The beer walks a strange line between hops and sugar and I suppose works, but it's a real sipper and nothing that I would ever want more than one of, every 12 months or so. A fairly decent dose of vanilla, too.
Frankly I don't like this a lot, but it drinks more easily than I was expecting."
Hamm's Brewing Co.,Hamm's,,,American Adjunct Lager,?,can,2.18,3.5,2,2,3,2,2/5/2011,"12 oz can, many thanks go out to Kevin for the chance to try this one.
Can and the brand make this look like a real retro beer - America in the 50's and 60's is the feel I get from it.
Pour is a very pale golden hue with a large, frothy head. The head has some decent retention and lace, and doesn't look bad a tall. To be honest, I did pour it in a very aggressive manner.
Nose and tastes are largely devoid of any character with a slight, sweet grain note and perhaps a little crisp citrus.
To be honest, as the beer warms it becomes increasingly water-like and the beer begins to lose its nostalgic charm.
Thought it may have been better than it was, but in the end it turned out to be just another dreadful, American, non-descript adjunct lager."
"Lakefront Brewery, Inc.",Eastside Dark,,,Munich Dunkel Lager,5.50%,bottle,2.18,4,3.5,1.5,3,1.5,2/5/2011,"12 oz single, no freshness date to be seen (notches missing from the label). Thanks go out to Kevin for the chance to drink this one.
Pour is a surprisingly dark one, going beyond even the dark brown that was expecting and taking it to a new level with a close to black, stout like hue.
Head is good, rocky and pitted, produces some nice lace with its retention.
Smell has some malty goodness, and he beer in terms of the way it looks and smells is certainly promising. However...
...when we taste it is has a nasty, blue cheese like funk about it and not in a good way. this beer is either old, infected or a catastrophic effort at a Dunkel - maybe all three. Without freshness dates I feel obligated to review.
I manage to get a few mouthfuls down and then down the drain it goes. A shame because frankly this beer looks like it has potential, definitely one to go back and re-visit sometime in the future."
"Lakefront Brewery, Inc.",White Beer,,,Witbier,4.60%,bottle,3,3,3,3,3,3,2/5/2011,"12 oz single courtesy of Kevin - many thanks.
The beer pours with a requisite, hazy lemon pour with a somewhat disappointing head. Retention and lace are lackluster to be honest.
The beer does contain all of the character that should be in a Wit, but it seems watery, light and without depth or presence. Slight touches or coriander, and orange peel but it simply isn't enough. The beer does come through with a little bit of citrus acidity, but the whole package is too light by far.
Too wishy-washy to give me an satisfaction, but to be honest the type of beer that probably benefits from a fresh pour, nearer the source. Not something that I am likely to experience in the near future though."

Black pour with an attractive, pitted, mocha colored head that is light and bubbly. Looks nice.
Nice is a somewhat neutral malty sweetness, even when warmed slightly.
The initial taste blast is a little unexpected and seems quite bitter and hoppy. I wasn't expecting this a all considering the style and it is really noticeable. I didn't like that jolt very much, but on the plus side as soon as it came, it faded and the middle and back end of the beer behaved in a much more standard fashion. Some light roast and a sweet back end give a more traditional flavor to the Schwarzbier.
Not bad, but not a style and therefore a beer, that I'm really fond of so I doubt I'll be visiting this again anytime soon.
It says something about he craft beer scene in the US when I am delighted by the fact that the beer is *only* 5%!"
Shaw Wallace & Company Ltd.,Haywards 5000 Super Premium Beer,,,American Adjunct Lager,7.00%,bottle,3.03,3.5,2.5,3,3,3.5,2/5/2011,"A Super-Premium beer no less! What could possibly go wrong?!
Having spent a large portion of my first 35 years of life in Indian restaurants, I though that I had seen most of the Indian based adjunct lagers that one could be exposed to , but this was a new one on me. Went to an Atlanta curry house and sw it on the menu, but they were out. A few days later i picked up this gold foiled, 650 mL bottle at Total Wine, Perimeter, Atlanta, GA, USA for $2.49 (I think). 
There really is very little to report her in terms of the appearance (golden clarity, initially high carbonation, frothy head, small amount of lace and retention), nose (largely bland but with a grainy sweetness), taste (INCREDIBLY sweet, even by the standards normally associated with such things), or the drinkability (OK for what it is and it could wash down a hot curry), but for me the beer has a certain, strange charm. Perhaps it's the curry association, maybe the presentation, or perhaps even the marketing, but this is a beer that I enjoyed drinking and would re-visit.
If you cannot stand the sweetness I wouldn't be surprised, and to be fair I am not exactly recommending this, but for me it was a decent example of something that I was expecting little from."
Spoetzl Brewery,Shiner Blonde,,,American Pale Lager,4.40%,can,2,2,2,2,3,1.5,2/5/2011,"12 oz can courtesy of Kevin - many thanks.
Well, it is what is. No more, no less.
Typical, light straw colored pour with perfect clarity, low carbonation and, virtually no head and zero retention and lace. Could be one of a million different macros of the same ilk, but the color is getting close to completely non-existent. Pale as plae can be.
Nose gives a touch of grainy alcohol.
Tastes are a largely neutral sweetness and almost nothing else. Character is firmly at zero, but no skunk and perhaps a slight bitterness in the swallow.
Somewhat refreshing, but so is water."
Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),Samuel Adams Latitude 48 IPA,,,American IPA,6.00%,bottle,3.95,4,4,4,3.5,4,2/2/2011,"12 oz single, Total Wine, Perimeter, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Nice mid-copper pour with plenty of light carbonation and some decent, broken white, airy head.
For an American IPA the nose is really quite malty. It reminds me a little of a Sam Oktoberfest. Quite a shock.
Tastes are also strangely sweet and malt based with what comes across as a layering effect of bitterness from the hops. Middle, back end and finish combine to give quite a coinage metal effect and a short, sharp grapefruit ending.
I quite like this beer, and definitely enjoyed more than I though that I might. It delivers a very strong malt base behind the metallic and clean hop tastes, and a ll in all delivers a pretty satisfying bitterness. Some may be disappointed with the lighter touch that this American IPA delivers, but I on the other hand think it combines some decent, Nobel bite along with some simplicity.
Tasty, and a beer that works for me."

This is the third in the series for me, and I had pretty poor experiences with the Stone and Victory versions (the Victory was especially awful), so my hopes are low for this one. Having said that, this kind of things is something that DFH is likely to pull off better than the other two breweries involved so there is more hope.
Nice golden pour, with some attractive cloudiness that is appropriate for the style. Impressive, fluffy and pillow like head.
Nose and tastes do have a floral and herbal element, but it is nowhere near as aggressive and overwhelming as the other Saison Du Buff's. Quite a lot of lemongrass, and a full, fluffy mouthfeel. Not a great deal of complexity here in as much as it does not deliver any white pepper or any subtle fruit, phenol or ester notes, but it does end with a touch of spicy bitterness that lingers a little.
Much more in a classic Saison style than the other two 'Buff's' and in that respect I like it a lot more, and it sits better with me. best of the three by a LONG distance, and frankly that should not really surprise us given that DFH is a brewery that handles this type of beer better than Stone and Victory."
Jailhouse Brewing Company,Smokey,,,Smoked Beer,?,on-tap,3.93,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,1/30/2011,"Very surprised to come across this - I hadn't heard that this was out, but delighted to try in when I took a break from the Atlanta Cask Ale tasting by slipping into the bar at Taco Mac, Prado with the wife.
Pour was a dark brown affair that was presented with far too little head. This was a pouring issue rather than a beer issue - a common problem when drinking at Taco Mac.
The beer was also too cold, which had an influence on the nose. With time, the beer did release its aroma and when they came it was worth the wait. Some decent, light, understated smoke.
Tastes were are very simple smoke, with some decent malt to back it up. the beer was pretty straightforward and simple, which for me is becoming both a signature trait and a great strength for Glenn and Jailhouse. If you want over the top, complicated nonsense then look elsewhere. If you want well made beer with a simplicity that yells 'quality' then Jailhouse is a brewery that will work for you.
Glenn has a commitment to a house style and to beer that has simplicity but solidly made. This is an interesting diversion which proves he has the capacity to step outside those parameters and do some interesting things. Jailhouse is truly a player to watch."
Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,Sierra Nevada Hoptimum,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,10.40%,bottle,3.6,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,1/30/2011,"2011 vintage.
The 24 oz large format bottle that SN seems to have favored for this type of release for sometime now. $9.99 from Smyrna World of Beverage, Smyrna, Atlanta, GA, USA.
A very, very attractive looking beer. A beautiful golden, clear body with some significant white, frothy, sticky lace which is well retained considering the ABV, and is really pretty.
Nose has some alcohol, but frankly not a huge amount of hop presence when considering the nature of the beast.
The tastes are similarly sweet and slick as opposed to very hoppy. There's a little hop burn in the chest with the alcohol, but it doesn't tear at the palate in a massively aggressive manner. The slick mouthfeel is appropriate and to be expected when considering the style and the alcohol content.
There is a decent amount of solvent in the very back end, finish and aftertaste which takes a little away from the overall experience for me, but the beer never really delivers what I would call a huge hop battering. Some metal in the aftertaste too.
OK, but poor value for money."
Tommyknocker Brewery,Oaked Butt Head Bock,,,Doppelbock,8.10%,bottle,2.18,2.5,2.5,2,2.5,2,1/28/2011,"12 oz single, Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour is a muddy, Dubbel-like mid brown with a disappointing lack of clarity.
Musty aroma with some blue cheese notes and a mild acidity - slight lactose aroma. Strange.
Tastes reflect the nose and offer a weird combination of light acidity (unexpected) amongst the more predictable smoke/oak notes and the malty, alcohol strong, Doppelbock flavors.
Not sure that there is any point in oaking a Doppelbock I think that there is precious little to be gained. This beer ends up being a messy version of something that would have been much better left well alone. For me, a classic example of what's bad about tinkering with beers."

Pour is a strange, hazed and cloudy pour with a butterscotch color.
This is a sweet, grainy, musty beer which frankly is pretty unimpressive. Some notes of cardboard and a mixture of lemony sweetness come together to produce a beer that is a prickly, fizzy, bland and watery concoction.
Not good, and I'm not sure what this is trying to be, but either way - no thanks."

A nice, butterscotch colored, unfiltered look, Half decent head but not much lace.
Nose is pretty light and gives up nothing more than a touch of citrus and perhaps some vegetal notes.
The tastes are much better and deeper than the nose would suggest. Some citrus wheat, a little light bitterness and a decent fruity finish.
Decent taste and a beer that would be interesting fresher and on tap. Delighted by the ABV as well."
Great Divide Brewing Company,Rumble IPA,,,American IPA,7.10%,bottle,2.55,4,3.5,2,3.5,2,1/23/2011,"12 oz single.
Pour gives a copper colored clarity and a nice, full white head. Quite creamy looking. The appearance is without question the highlight here.
Nose has a lot of soapy character and not much else. I like the soap note in the nose, but it does not really get carried forward into the tastes.
The beer is quite bitter - with a metallic twang. I'm not sure that oaking an IPA is a wise move, and the combination seems to create a very, very bitter affair with all the bad aspects of unrefined grapefruit and none of the good. A tiny vanilla note upfront is almost immediately overwhelmed. The bitterness does not have much charm, and it creates a burning nastiness that lingers for some time.
Not a good idea and not a beer that tastes good at all. If you want colossal bitterness with no let up, I suppose you may like it - I don't"

The pour produces an almost transparent lemon yellow color, a highly carbonated but a typically poorly retained head and not much lace. Frankly it screams American adjunct lager which I suppose could be viewed as a good thing!
Light, grainy and neutral nose.
Tastes are watery and only give a sweet, light vegetal and light grainy effect.
Pretty much devoid of any character or taste but to be honest not offensive in any way. Still, pretty much exactly as one would expect"
The Lost Abbey,The Angel's Share - Brandy Barrel-Aged,,,American Strong Ale,12.00%,bottle,3.7,2,4,4,2,4,1/23/2011,"375 mL bottle, corked and caged bottle from Mac's, Atlanta, GA, USA. $14 for the privilege. 11.5% on the label.
It's flat. 100% flat. Was pretty positive that it would be even before I bought it, but it still needs to be recorded.
The beer pours with a dark brown, mid-viscosity and obviously zero head, lace or retention.
The nose and tastes give what amounts to be a glass of sherry. Lots of rum & raisin ice-cream notes, other dark fruits, brown sugar and light, evaporating alcohol. A few woody notes, some sweet and sour balance and some drying apple.
Alcohol taste lingers in the finish.
Given the lack of carbonation, the beer is actually incredibly drinkable. I cannot imagine how much I would like this if it were even mildly carbonated. Essentially it's a poor mans Utopias.
I suppose that this is a ""beer"" that essentially can do without the carbonation, since its lack converts it to a sherry, i.e. a beer much like Utopias, but the annoying thing is that I don't suppose LA started out with the intention of producing a totally uncarbonated beer - did they?"
"Lakefront Brewery, Inc.",Wheat Monkey,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,4.20%,bottle,3.15,3,3,3,3.5,3.5,1/22/2011,"12 oz bottle, many thanks go out to Kevin for the chance to try this.
Pour is a pretty standard, requisite hazed yellow color that looks a tad watery. A few yeast sediment particles that ultimately dissolve to add to the murky, unfiltered nature.
It is what it is, meaning it delivers a pretty average, very light, a tad watery body on top of diluted wheat notes in the nose and tastes.
It's fine, it acts as a decent thirst quencher. Light grain notes in the aroma and a very, very mildly acidic finish complete the picture.
For me, this style is really heavily dependent on two factors. Freshness and weather context. In the middle of a hot summer with the beer coming straight out of the tank, one could really get to love many American Pale Wheat's. Under less favorable circumstances of freshness and temperature, bees in this style can appear watery and bland."
North Peak Brewing Company,Majestic Wheat Ale,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,5.50%,bottle,2.75,2.5,3,2.5,3,3,1/22/2011,"Retro looking bottle (as per the BA db picture), thanks to Kevin for the chance to try this beer.
Pour gives an alarming, quite dark orange color with a lot of dirty sediment and a large, billowing head. Lace is average, some stickiness.
Nose gives a blast of acidity that I take as a good sign, thinking theat there may be some depth to the flavor - there isn't, or at least nowhere near as much as the appearance and the nose would suggest.
Very ordinary in the mouth, the beer has a few wheat characteristics but ultimately fails to deliever in any significant manner. Perhaps a few citrus, lemon hnts of acidity but overalll disappointing.
I liked the presentation, shame that was just about the best part of the beer."
Terrapin Beer Company,Terrapin Hoptaneous Combustion,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,9.30%,bottle,4,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,1/22/2011,"$9.99 for the 22 oz, foiled and boxed bomber. Bottle #2002.
Pour is a rather attractive golden color with some nice clarity. Head is tall, frothy and sticky. Retention is average, wish it was better to complete the visual package.
Nose is a typical, fruity hop bomb with some alcohol and largely in line for the style. If this were a blind tasting I don't think I would pick up any smoke at all, but knowing that there is some present the beer does reveal a hint - no more, but enough to let me know what's going on.
Unsurprisingly this is a big beer with a good smattering of typical grapefruit and peach fruit and a harsh ending. The finish is combination of quite jarring ethanol and hop resins.
There is a hint of smoke that runs throughout the beer and although it is slightly more noticeable in the tastes than the nose, I remain unconvinced that I would detect it blind. I suspect that I would say that the beer had a spiciness to it which I think can be attributed to the smoke, but without knowing that I might just say that it was 'peppery'.
The mouthfeel is a bit slick, but that's appropriate considering ABV and style.
The beer works well, BUT strangely I find myself craving more smoke! It's tasty but would be even better with more of the charred notes. Like most beers of its type it's going to work best with food.
The third and fourth beers in the theater series have proved to be much better than the first two, and have even done enough to restore a little faith in Terrapin. As ever with this series, value is lacking even when considering the cause."
"Lakefront Brewery, Inc.",IPA,,,American IPA,6.90%,bottle,3.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,1/16/2011,"12 oz single, taken from notes, many thanks to Kevin for the opportunity to try this one. There IS a freshness ""strip"" on the side of the label, but as is sometimes the case, the notches are missing - frustrating.
A hazy orange pour, a sticky white head but a few yeast particles/floaties that I could do without. When the particles settle at the bottom of the glass we see some medium carbonation. The head is nicely retained and the stickiness is always a good sign for a beer like this.
Nose has plenty of light hops - nothing amazing, but nevertheless ""present"". A *slight* green hop cone note in the nose as well.
Tastes are those of a well tempered, American IPA. By that I mean there is plenty of hop bitterness, but the malt backbone hols it together well. A somewhat paradoxically fruity taste up front, followed by a dry finish. Interesting combination.
The finish is quite short, has a little metal and reiterates the dry character. Alcohol doesn't seem like it is almost 7%.
Pretty good example of the style, and a beer that I enjoyed more than I though that I might. Taken as a package, this is a beer that one could easily have on hand on a regular basis as a solid staple. Nothing earth shattering, but pretty solid."
"Lakefront Brewery, Inc.",Klisch Pilsner Beer,,,German Pilsener,5.40%,bottle,2.28,2.5,2.5,2,2.5,2.5,1/16/2011,"12 oz single, from notes, many thanks go out to Kevin for the chance to try this beer. Label is slightly different to the one in the BA db where the words Pilsner Beer have simply become ""Pilsner"". Notched as being bottle in Wk 1, May but no year given, assuming 2010.
The pour yields a beer that has a pilsner color (perhaps it's a little more 'yellow'), but unfortunately it comes with a slight haze that substantially detracts from the clarity. Not really what I'm looking for here, and it upsets the balance of the look. In addition the carbonation seems a little low to me, and the head and lace could both be much better.
Nose and tastes are both very disappointing. They add up to what is simply a non-offensive macro, adjunct lager and not much else. There's no Saaz or Noble bitterness, and these is a lack of a clean edge. With those attributes missing, a beer that is supposed to be a genuine pilsner can drop off very quickly.
Weak, disappointing if at least NOT unpleasant."
Coors Brewing Company,Blue Moon Pale Moon,,,Belgian Pale Ale,5.40%,on-tap,3.7,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,1/15/2011,"On draught at Buffalo Wild Wings, Douglasville, GA, USA.
Orange body with a small head and some sticky lace. Slight haze to the body.
Quite a surprising green/ fresh hop note in the nose. Agitating the beer produces even more of the same - wasn't expecting that!
No Belgian yeast character to speak of. The beer is quite 'snappy' with some really clean lines and some fairly well defined fruit notes. Light zing in the finish and a crisp drink.
Not bad at all. A simple beer which is a plus for me, a sensible (if not exactly low) ABV, combine to produce a tasty, balanced beer that is very drinkable. Light touch with some malt presence too.
Good beer, ""as a beer"" if NOT as an example of the style - in that respect it's poor."
East End Brewing Company,Gratitude,,,American Barleywine,11.50%,bottle,2.33,3.5,2.5,2,3.5,2,1/14/2011,"2009 Blue Wax - thanks go out to PittBeerGirl for the chance to try this. 750 mL, paper-wrapped affair.
A hazy, orange copper color body with better head and lace that I was expecting for a beer of its size.
Aroma and initial tastes are excruciatingly sweet, and it's a sweetness that lacks the charm of an English Barleywine and comes charging at you with clumsiness.
The beer is a convoluted and confusing array of alcohol, sugar, malt and tastes that seem to be esters in their profile but are difficult to pin down.
I like sweet beers but for me, this is a unwieldy, aggressive, awkward and stumbling beer that lacks refinement."
"Middle Ages Brewing Co., Ltd.",Dragonslayer,,,Russian Imperial Stout,9.50%,bottle,3.43,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,1/13/2011,"22 oz bottle that I purchased in a Wegman's in Binghamton, NY, USA.
Pour is exactly what one would expect; oily black body, with a thin, mocha film on the surface of the beer.
The alcohol in the nose seems a little strong and it has me a bit concerned for the tastes. In reality it doesn't manifest itself quite as aggressively as the aroma would suggest, but it is still a prominent feature.
At first I didn't think that this was going to be a very hoppy stout, but as the glass and bottle progressed it seemed to build in hop bitterness. A underlying very slight lactose note seemed to added to the sour/bitter elements and the beer got quite sharp.
Light roastiness runs across the middle of the palate and adds to the dry, bitter character.
Quite surprised at how hoppy this stout was. and that is generally not to my liking. I think this would do better in the American Double Stout category."
"Middle Ages Brewing Co., Ltd.",Duke Of Winship,,,Scottish Ale,6.50%,bottle,3,4,3,3,2.5,3,1/13/2011,"12 oz single.
The label suggests that this beer is a cross between a Scotch Ale and a Porter. I'm not sure what that means, but in the final analysis the beer drinks largely like an American Porter to me.
""American"" in the manner that the hops are higher than the original English version, and the beer has a less creamy texture and finishes drier. No Scotch Ale character for me.
Dark brown pour with a few reddish highlights. Head is good and leaves some decent lace.
Nose has some malts but is fairly neutral. A few darker grains,
A little thin, lacks a creamy texture. Dry finish with a touch of bitterness and light prickle on the carbonation.
Not much going on here, but the beer is non-offensive. Unfortunately it is also non-memorable as well. Sort of a neutral beer for me."
Kuhnhenn Brewing Company,Kuhnhenn Fourth D,,,Old Ale,13.50%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,1/12/2011,"2008 vintage. 12 oz bottle.
Big thanks go out to finewinemike for the chance to try this as part of my Secret Santa 2010 box.
Pour is a dark brown, muddy affair with a huge, well retained coffee colored, ice-cream styled foam that eventually falls away to give a light foam.
Nose gives a fairly predictable sherry like note, but to be honest it comes with a little oxidative, mustiness that takes the edge of a little.
The tastes do something similar. A sweet, very light Madeira note dominates, but again a slightly oxidized, alcohol element cuts across the finish. there is even a noticeable last minute dash of acidity that confirms the oxidation. Not troublesome, more surprising.
The finish introduces the best part of the beer for me. I get some distinct pepper amongst the sherry and oxidized elements and it works well. Very interesting, very good but if I'm honest it did not live up to the (massive) hype,"
"Middle Ages Brewing Co., Ltd.",Wizard's Winter Ale,,,English Strong Ale,6.30%,bottle,3.48,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,1/12/2011,"12 oz single. 
Murky. mid-brown/orange pour that creates some head but not much lace.
Nose offers a malty fruit base that adds a little bitterness that is reminiscent of grapefruit, but to be honest it's not a grapefruit taste that one normally associates with a high hop profile.
Similar things happen in the taste, where the slightly bitter grapefruit sits on the fruity end of the spectrum rather than the hop end of the scale.
As the paragraphs above would suggest, the beer is really quite fruity and only has a a hint of bitterness in the finish. Winter Warmer? I dunno, this seem quite malty and English in its taste and doesn't deliver any spice notes at all.
OK, but not a lot more."
Jolly Pumpkin Artisan Ales,La Parcela,,,Pumpkin Ale,6.00%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,1/11/2011,"750 mL bottle, Batch 610 bottled 8-13-10. Label says 5.9%, not 6.0% ABV.
Jolly Pumpkin is a frustrating brewery to me - more of that later. 
The pour produces a burnt orange hue with a small head that produces some nice, white lace. Looks good.
The nose and tastes are well,...Jolly Pumpkin! Light acidity, strong apple notes, plenty of cider character and the light funk and mild Brett character. They meld quite nicely together and the beer offers a sharp, refreshing and slightly ethanoic acid finish. Tasty, satisfying, but...
...ZERO, and I mean ZERO (as in totally devoid) of any pumpkin character, and that's central to my problem with JP beers in general.
The second half of the bottle produces a lot of nasty looking coagulated protein or sediment.
Frankly, being experienced with J beers I wasn't expecting a ""Pumpkin beer"", nor was I expecting anything other than the cider character than I got, so my question is WHY call the beer a pumpkin beer? Why not take the Fantôme route, and call ALL the beers that they make, some version of a Saison/Wild/Farmhouse??
It's confusing and a little frustrating."
Firestone Walker Brewing Co.,Firestone 13 - Anniversary Ale,,,American Strong Ale,12.00%,bottle,4.68,4.5,4.5,5,4,4.5,1/10/2011,"22 oz, boxed bottle as per the FW Anniversary series.
A couple of inches of snow in Atlanta, another half inch of ice on top and a snow day gives me an unexpected opportunity to crack this one - not much else to do!
Beer pours essentially a jet black pour with perhaps some very dark brown colors at the extremities. A thin, tan head that recede to give a white color around the glass. 
The nose is strong even when the beer is cool, but becomes potent as it warms. The liquor and alcohol aromas are increasingly strong, and really sharp in the nose from several inches away, and noticeable from several feet! This concerned me a bit, since I was thinking that if this was going to manifest itself in the taste then I wasn't going to be too happy.
The tastes DO reflect the nose, but they are surprisingly mellow when considering the volatiles that are escaping the DFH signature glass. With over a year on this beer, there is a pretty large element of sweetness that stands up to the aggressive liquor notes and the alcohol. Make no mistake, this beer is still a big beast, but there is a tamed element to it, despite the warm that builds in the chest on the way down, and the light solvent touch that evaporates in the mouth as the beer is consumed.
I was very wary of this before I opened it as I typically don't care for the bourbon notes too much, but there is a whole bunch of other notes that combine to produce a great package; oak, a little smoke, vanilla, dark plums and molasses and rum. The alcohol stings and gives a touch of pepper as well. These tastes meld well with the bourbon elements to produce a full on assault that is surprisingly drinkable.
Tasty and better than I was expecting and certainly more drinkable."
"Middle Ages Brewing Co., Ltd.",ImPaled Ale,,,English India Pale Ale (IPA),6.50%,bottle,3.68,3.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,1/10/2011,"12 oz single thanks to Rob.
Light , golden orange body with an initially, big rocky head that leaves some nice sticky lace. Slight haze/cloudiness. 
Nose and tastes are typically English in terms of the biscuity malts and the relatively restrained hop profile. I think that this is a slightly older bottle, so it may be that these attributes are a function of some time, and earlier on this beer was more ""American"" in its feel.
Light metal in the finish, but this adds to the clean feel associated with the beer. Some light peach and other soft fruits cut across the back end to end a sweetness to the beer. Surprisingly fruity actually!
Seems a touch thin in the mouth to metal.
Tasty and drinkable beer with a number of drinkable attributes."
Atlantic Brewing Company,Bar Harbor Blueberry Ale,,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,5.20%,bottle,2.7,3.5,4,2.5,2,2,1/9/2011,"12 oz single, courtesy of Kevin - thanks mate.
A clouded, ""orangey"", copper colored pour with some scant white head but a lack of much presence or lace.
A somewhat attractive blueberry based fruit aroma comes off the beer, even when quite cold. This nose intensifies as the beer warms as the volatiles escape.
Tastes are unfortunately less attractive than the nose would suggest, but in a surprising way. Sometimes, beers like this a criticized for their ""imitation"" fruit flavors but that's not the problem here. In fact I would describe the blueberries are quite ""natural tasting"", however the beer is oddly sweet with a combination of sugar notes and high, solvent alcohol taste that makes it rather difficult to drink. It's a bit sickly sweet in its taste, and this is coming from someone that usually loves sweet beers. The combination does not meld very well together for me, and last third of the bottle is not consumed.
The beer ends up being too heavy, and I am looking for a brew with MUCH cleaner lines if I am picking up a fruit based beer. Here is seems like there is an unlikely combination of high sugar levels with excess alcohol! Seems odd, I know but whatever it is, and however it was achieved, it does not drink easily.
I am NOT against fruit beer in general, it just seems as though this one is not coming together very well."
"August Schell Brewing Co., Inc.",Schell's Dark,,,Munich Dunkel Lager,4.80%,bottle,3.13,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,1/9/2011,"12 oz bottle, many thanks Kevin.
Interesting. I actually really like the presentation. The clear glass with the dark contents look appealing and interesting to me, and frankly whilst completely understanding and not disputing the chemistry, I feel that the number of problems with skunking are generally overblown a little. Anyway....
...a solid, chocolate brown colored pour with some great looking clarity. Carbonation is OK, but I wish that it provided a better head and some increased retention. If we could get that up a little this would be a really nice looking beer indeed.
Malty notes dominate (obviously) but with them becomes a touch of musty cardboard. Something similar comes in the tastes too, and ultimately I feel that this beer is one the verge of being quite tasty, but ultimately doesn't really cut it. There is a distinct German yeast note in there along with some sweet, malt based sugars, and in all all it's not bad at all.
Perhaps a touch thin, and whatever is needed to increase the body, the head retention and give the beer a little more depth of flavor, needs to be added to take this one over the top."
Mad River Brewing Company,Steelhead Double India Pale Ale,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,8.60%,bottle,1.98,1.5,2.5,2,2,1.5,1/9/2011,"12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour is a rich, clouded, honey orange hue with an inordinate number of yest floaties. The combination of the color, floaties and general muddy appearance does nothing for the beer and frankly makes it appear somewhat ""soup-like"". This is not a good sign in my book. Head is strong though, and leaves lots of sticky lace.
Nose and tastes both give similarly muddled impressions. Hop bitterness and edge is lacking, and it is replaced by a large, unwieldy malt presence that manifests itself as unattenuated sugar. Strange. the beer lacks a clean edge in many respects, and it comes across as a ""kitchen sink"" beer. This type of concoction is a manifestation of all that's bad about contemporary, American brewing. The idea that somehow more of everything makes a beer, ""better"".
It's a soupy, unpleasant mess with hardly any redeeming features. A lot of stuff, poorly managed and thrown together. Alcohol is burning and aggressive to boot. the sugar and alcohol make it slick in the mouth.
Frankly, I think it is a poorly brewed beer."
"Middle Ages Brewing Co., Ltd.",Swallow Wit,,,Witbier,4.80%,bottle,3.08,2.5,3,3,3,3.5,1/9/2011,"12 oz single from my brother-in-law - cheers Rob.
Not sure about this from the get-go. Is this a filtered Wit? Seems odd to say the least. The beer is golden with a small head but almost has zero cloudiness in the glass. Makes me feel odd, a bit like the disconnect between the appearance and taste that one finds in the American-style India Black Ales.
Smell offers some light lemon and that peculiar sinus clearing carbonation that can sometimes exist in a beer.
Lemon notes are less prominent in the tastes than the nose would suggest but still offers a decent blast of citrus. the carbonation is quite high and deliver some prickly mouthfeel elements. Finish is short and clean with a snappy, quick bitterness.
This is a drinkable beer, but as for being a typical Wit I would say no. All the way from the appearance through the lack of yeast/wheat character and the lack of any significant orange or coriander notes, I would say it is this lacks many of those attributes. It's OK, unoffensive and fairly simple, but it's not a beer that you would point to as being typical."
"Middle Ages Brewing Co., Ltd.",Syracuse Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),5.00%,bottle,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,1/8/2011,"12 oz single.
I've always liked Middle Ages but they pulled out of GA a long time ago (at least I don't see their beer any longer in these parts), this bottle came from my brother-in-law in upstate NY - cheers Rob.
Slightly hazed, orange gold body with a soapy looking, one finger head. Head is light and frothy in appearance. Lace is minimal.
Carbonation seems a little low.
Tastes are fairly straightforward grains with a hint of bitterness in the back end. Light soapy tastes compliment the bitterness to yield a drier than expected finish.
Surprisingly I get a yew lemon notes in the beer which add to its lightness and make it pretty drinkable. Light lemon persists all the way through to the finish and the aftertaste.
An interesting beer in as much as it seemed a little more complex that I was expected. I was left with an impression by the lemon tastes and a feeling that this is a paradoxically simple and slightly more complex beer wrapped up in a single package."
Terrapin Beer Company,Terrapin Sound Czech,,,German Pilsener,5.50%,bottle,4.23,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,1/8/2011,"#3 in the Georgia Theater series (although apparently this and #4 were seemingly essentially, simultaneously released), and as a pair they complete an extraordinarily large number of beers released by Terrapin in the last twelve months.
22 oz bottle with the usual presentation of the gold foil and the fancy box. $10.99 for the privilege.
Crystal clear, light golden clarity with an impressive, rocky, pillow-like head, great carbonation and some super lace. Very good looking indeed.
A really clean, light grainy nose with a dash of white pepper. Again, impressive for the style.
Clean body with the requisite character; clean lines, slight bitterness (in a Saaz/Noble type manner) and a short ending. Although good, perhaps paradoxically the tastes are the weakest part of the beer. I would like the bitterness to be a little more prominent.
Without question the best beer that Terrapin has put out amongst this muddled, confused and somewhat frantic recent series of side projects and other, ""special"" releases. Having said that, and despite the fact that I am very happy to pay a premium price for ANY premium beer (lower ABV ones included), the value is debatable even considering the cause."
Geary's Brewing Co.,Geary's Hampshire Special Ale,,,English Strong Ale,7.00%,bottle,3.05,3,3,3,3.5,3,1/6/2011,"12 oz bottle courtesy of finewinemike as part of my 2010 Secret Santa package. This beer was on my Wants list for a long time, and I must admit I'm a bit confused by that - I *think* that's because BA used to have this categorized as an ESB, and a such I was interested in in. I have the feeling that this haas been re-categorized iin the BA db.
A very hazy, mid-orange pour that yields some frothy, ""dirty"" head and comes with some yeast sediment from the bottle. Some sticky lace.
Very strong bread nose with plenty of sweetness.
Tastes are similar to the nose in as much as we get a big blast of malt and plenty of biscuity character. There is (somewhat disappointingly) quite a lot of solvent alcohol taste, too. The sweetness (which is fairly intense), does temper the alcohol some, but the overall package feels STRONGLY ""American"" in a s much as it is pretty much devoid of much subtlety.
The English malt/biscuit character is there, however the beer stomps all over the simplicity of that. When the simple notes are lost, it seems a bit like the point of this beer is left behind.
I dunno, this feels like an ""Imperial ESB"" which in my book is an oxymoron - shame."
Rogue Brewery (Brewer's on the Bay),Rogue 21,,,Old Ale,8.00%,bottle,4.23,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,1/6/2011,"Bought this several months ago, at Hop City, Atlanta, GA and paid the slightly absurd price of approx. $20! The bottle is pretty extravagant, even by ridiculous Rogue standards. My guess is that the price is why there are only 15 reviews before mine, despite the fact that this beer has been out for a LONG time.
The beer pours with a mid-brown, clouded body and a healthy, light tan head. Some decent lace considering the ABV.
The nose is not especially strong, even on warming. It reveals a little malty sugar but not much else.
The tastes are pretty interesting. Very, very well balanced slightly bitter malts, with virtually no hint of the alcohol. There is some simple sweetness up front, but this gives way to yield an extremely mild, light and gentle touch of hops - just a kiss.
The finish is very short and clean.
This is a very atypical Rogue beer, but the best that I've had (along with Maierfest) in recent years.
The price is the real issue here, and if you consider it alone this beer is dreadful value, however it IS a really nice beer. Very mild, subtle and surprisingly so for a Rogue beer. Drinkable, tasty and well-balanced. The latter not really a trait of Rogue beers!"
A1A Aleworks,Porpoise Point Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),5.40%,on-tap,2.93,3.5,2.5,3,3,3,1/2/2011,"Decent looking pour with a golden body sitting underneath a small, white cap of foam.
Despite the small head, the carbonation seems quite aggressive and vigorous and a little prickly. Not much aroma, even after it warms. This beer clearly doesn't have a lot of volatiles present.
Semi-sweet grains with perhaps a touch of zesty fruit, but in no way is this beer either bitter or particularly tasty. Lacks much depth, but at least it is non-offensive. I found it refreshing and drinkable, but the beer doesn't really stand out in any way.
It's the kind of beer that I would be absolutely delighted to be able to produce in my garage, but at the same time also pretty disappointed if I couldn't! What I mean by that is that the beer doesn't have any flaws as such, but is truly a pretty mediocre effort for a professional outfit."
Cigar City Brewing,Bolita Brown Double Nut Brown Ale,,,English Brown Ale,9.00%,bottle,3.55,4.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,3,1/2/2011,"750 mL from Broudy's Liquors in St. Augustine. $8.99 for the capped, dimple-bottomed, thick brown glass bottle.
Now under the name, ""Bolita Double Brown Ale"" (the ""nut"" part of the name is missing from this bottle).
Impressive, dark chestnut brown color with a really creamy, espresso type head that has nice retention and some very creamy, coating lace. Looks like the proverbial dark chocolate milkshake.
Plenty of malty, bready alcohol in the nose.
Creamy mouthfeel with a hint of acidity and perhaps even a touch of lactose character. The tastes do not give much in the way of nuttiness until the finish where there is a hint of hazelnut and a bitterness that one would associate with the outer skin of a Brazil nut. Drink more like a milk stout to me, and even though the label describes this as a ""Northern English Brown Ale"", if you took this to a working mens club in Salford I think you might get a Kirby Kiss for your trouble. Way too much alcohol to even be considered as ""English"" anything IMO! As it warms the lactose note increases, and I KNOW this is not categorized as a Milk Stout!
Its full mouthfeel and creaminess are both the strength of this beer and its downfall. Nice, but just too much to ever make it really drinkable for me."
Orkney Brewery,The Red MacGregor,,,Scottish Ale,4.00%,bottle,3.9,4,4,4,3,4,1/2/2011,"500 mL bottle courtesy of finewinemike as part of the 2010 Secret Santa.
Delighted to get a beer with a sensible ABV for achange, and to be honest this is becoming a rarer and rarer treat. Shame.
Beer pours a fantastic red/tawny port color with a modest head and some sticky lace. With a better head, the beer would be close to perfect in appearance, but out of the bottle a t leas it does not quite deliver. (On draught, I think it may look a bit better).
I was expecting a typical, malty experience and the beer did deliver it, but to be honest it felt a touch on the light side to me. Light caramel and toffee grains interact with the bitterness to produce a beer hat has a LOT of bready character. No problem there, but some depth is missing for me. The beer remains extraordinary drinkable though, and within a few minutes the bottle has disappeared.
Easy drinking, but somehow leaves me wanting a little more malt depth. The brew seems a tad on the light side (and I'm NOT talking about the alcohol) rather there is a mouthfeel that leaves me slightly dissatisfied."

Pour is a murky brown, Dubbel like affair with some decent head and some fairly significant lace. In that respect, pretty nice to look at.
Some Belgian yeast notes in the nose and tastes, but also a fair amount of hop character that I wasn't really expecting. The hops, although fairly muted and reserved, still sing out too much for the style for me, and frankly don't belong there, even in the relatively muted manner that they appear. Caramel malts are present but to be honest they get a little overwhelmed in terms of the whole package.
Alcohol is fairly present too, and this comes across as quite strong beer.
A beer that falls a little awkwardly between two stools and as a result fails to deliver properly on either. Needs some work before I would visit this again."
The Bruery,3 French Hens,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,10.00%,bottle,3.93,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,1/2/2011,"750 mL capped bottle in the usual ""The Bruery"" presentation.
Now I'm confused. Bought six bottles of this because I was sure I would like it, and after sharing bottle #1 I felt REALLY good about my purchase, however as I drink bottle #2 I feel less confident than I did a few weeks ago.
I had this for the first time about three weeks ago and absolutely loved it. Now I try it for the second time and I feel a little less enamored with it, but above all there seems to be a slight carbonation issue!
The beer pours with a lightly, chill-hazed brown-garnet pour. As I say, on this occasion the beer is poorly carbonated and lacks life. There is a little carbonation at first, but by the time the beer has sat in the glass for about ten minutes, it's completely flat. Disappointing, and not something that I experienced when I drank it three weeks ago.
Nose and tastes deliver plenty of honey, sugared alcohol and some light fruit. Good depth on the Belgian yest and fruit elements and the brew gives some nice fig and plum character. The beer finishes with a dry note that reminds one of the oak element, and a touch more drying ethanol. Aftertaste lingers and reinforces the dry character with some evaporating alcohol.
Definitely some woody, dry fruit in there too.
Interesting beer and I'm a little conflicted here. The carbonation worries me a bit, and it's confusing since I don't recall it being low a couple of weeks ago!?"

Comes with a nicely capped white head, some lace all sitting above a decently colored, garnet/brown, clear body.
The beer drinks true to style with some clean edges and a nice, malty base. Typical Gordon Biersch simplicity with their German based lagers.
The mouthfeel was pretty light and made for some simple, easy drinking,
Tasty beer."
Allagash Brewing Company,Allagash 10th Anniversary Ale,,,Witbier,10.00%,bottle,3.7,3,3,4,3.5,4,12/26/2010,"750 mL bottle courtesy of finewinemike in my 2010 Secret Santa package - many thanks Mike. Obviously this beer is quite old, and probably at an age way beyond what the brewer originally intended so the review should be viewed in that context.
Corked & Caged affair that opens with a pretty small pop and a touch of gun smoke. 
The pour is a fairly bright orange color, with a still body an a disappointing lack of carbonation/head/lace. I suppose that given the age of the beer that the carbonation situation should not be that surprising, but nevertheless it's a bit of a shame. The color is especially striking. 
The nose reveals a sugary sweetness and not a lot else. 
The body is a little cleaner than the sweetness in the nose would suggest. No cloying notes (that I was a little concerned about). 
In terms of taste, to be honest the beer isn't as good as I was expecting, but equally it seems a little unfair of me to expect that a beer this old would still perform as well as originally intended. Having said that, at 10% there might be a small degree of expectation that things would have held up OK. Any spices that were there originally have largely disappeared and there is a degree of mild oxidation. With the oxidation comes a very, very light touch of sherry (good), but also of course of touch of cardboard (bad). That's something that you have to live with when you are dealing with older beers.
In the very back end there is some light alcohol notes.
Despite the condition of the beer, it's still tasty and pretty drinkable I just wish that had drunk this beer when it had first come out - my bet is that this was amazing at the outset. One thing to note, age means that this beer drinks nothing like a Witbier now - the degree to which it did originally is unknown to me, so perhaps there has not been much change there at all, or maybe there has been a huge change.
Strangely (or perhaps NOT strangely at ALL) a very similar reaction to this beer as my reaction to Allagash 11th."
Central City Brewing,Red Racer IPA,,,American IPA,6.50%,can,3.95,4,4,4,3.5,4,12/24/2010,"Thanks go out to finewinemike for this beer as part of my Secret Santa package for 2010. 
A Canadian born IPA in can, quite the novelty! 
The pour produces a slightly hazed, orange body with lots of white head and some super, sticky lace - always a good sign.
Nose and tastes deliver some very fresh, clean light grapefruit notes, but it's never really aggressive. Finish IS on the dry side of things, but again lacks the puckering aggression that can sometimes come with the style.
Clean, lightly metallic American IPA which will please."
Deschutes Brewery,Jubel 2010,,,American Strong Ale,10.00%,bottle,4.23,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,12/24/2010,"22 oz, black waxed affair (as Abyss).
Pour is a superb looking, garnet color with some tremendous clarity. Head is small, leaves little lace but is a pleasing tea hue. Attractive.
Nose has a rich, sugary, molasses light liquor note that is replicated in the taste t a n extent, but the beer feels a little thinner than the nose suggests.
The tastes offer a touch more alcohol than the nose, plus some mild hop character.
This beer reminds me a lot of Fuller's Vintage Ale, except it seems to have a little less body, is a little less rich, has bit more alcohol and more hop notes! Sounds like a lot of differences, but when taken together it DOES remind me of the ""great one"". The beer drinks much more like an English beer (with notes of English Barleywines and English Old Ales).
There's a noticeable vinous character (obviously) from the Pinot Noir, and it builds as the beer warms. The vinous character is warming in the chest too, and it gives a really pleasant overall feel to the beer. 
Jubel 2010 is what I imagine a beer like Stone's Arrogant Bastard would be, if it went to live in England for a couple of years, learned some manners and etiquette and then came back to the USA to show-off it's more refined training! Pretty tasty stuff and delighted to have had the chance to try this beer."
Williams Brothers Brewing Company,Fraoch 20th Anniversary Ale,,,Scottish Gruit / Ancient Herbed Ale,11.00%,bottle,2.55,2.5,3.5,2.5,2,2,12/24/2010,"Many thanks go out to my Secret Santa for 2010, finewinemike for the chance to try this beer. This beer has been on my Wants list for quite some time, and having passed on it at least once in the store, I wondered if I would get the chance - many thanks, Mike. Bottled in July of 2009, this is described as being best before 2019.
Expensive looking in as much as the beer comes with a heavy gold foil, a neck label stating that this is bottle #1971 out of 7800 all in a heavy, green glass, 750 mL container. Surprisingly comes with one of those cheap, plastic sparkling wine ""corks"" which somewhat takes the edge off the presentation. Opens with a disappointing lack of carbonation.
The beer pours a pretty lifeless, somewhat drab, murky light brown color with very little head or lace. Nose has a musty, ""old"" note about it with a whiff of liquor.
The tastes are complicated with all kinds of elements pushing their way around. There is a diacetyl butter note, some butterscotch a strange, apple/fruit like acidity, a cheap lemon shandy note and finally some whisky based alcohol. The lemon notes pushes through to the greatest extent in the end, and the beer drinks something like an English lemonade shandy with a dash of whisky added.
It's odd, because frankly I don't like the taste very much at all, but there seems to be an odd draw about it that makes me come back and take another taste, just after I though I couldn't drink any more. However, this sensation does not last to the bottom of the bottle, and ultimately I had to dispose of it.
This was a disappointment frankly. Under=carbonated, and a beer that didn't look attractive and was WAY too busy to really get a handle on. Perhaps in very small quantities, and warmed?? I don't know what lead me to think that, but it struck me that warmed on a stove, this might work well."
Baird Brewing Company / Fishmarket Taproom,Jubilation Ale,,,Winter Warmer,7.00%,on-tap,4.08,3,3.5,4.5,4,4,12/22/2010,"22 oz bottle, $10.99 from Arbor Place Beverage, Douglasville, GA, USA.
Pour is a murky brown body with average head and lace. Not that enamored with the color or the appearance and it has me a little unhappy.
On to the nose and taste. It actually drinks in a much cleaner than the color and bod would suggest. The light fruit touch and the cleanliness are traits that I have (happily) begun to associate with Baird, and they are attributes that I enjoy. the nose has a lightly spiced alcohol note, neither of which are truly enforced in the taste. The tastes impart a fruit note (which I suppose are the figs) but frankly could be an orange, citrus based flavor as well. The cinnamon is really muted, and again could really be any, light, winter spice. Frankly it tastes better than it smells and a LOT better than it looks.
Pretty simple, Winter Warmer type of beer, and one that you would probably enjoy if you like the spice note to be a little more muted and less aggressive. Emphasis here is on a light fruit angle, which as I say above, seems to be angle that Baird takes quite a bit and one which I enjoy.
Not a classic Winter Warmer, but a lighter, fruitier version. One downside is the $10.99 price tag. Just a little too expensive to make it good value, although the beer itself is very nice."
Gordon Biersch Brewery Restaurant,Gordon Biersch Winter Bock,,,Doppelbock,7.50%,bottle,3.7,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,12/21/2010,"I think that in general, GB beers receive less than a fair shake, and I find many of their German based lagers tasty, brewed close to style and generally worthy.
12 oz single from Total Wine at Perimeter, Atlanta, GA, USA.
A great depth of garnet color on the pour, coupled with super clarity and a decent head, the beer looks really nice in the glass.
Nose gives some really good, alcohol soaked malts with a brief promise of some toasty warmth.
The beer delivers a taste that is a bit drier and more bitter than the nose (and indeed the style) would suggest. It delivers the aggression that one would expect from a Doppelbock, but doesn't quite punch with the sweet blows that one might expect. Extremely bready beer with lots of yeasty tastes.
The beer finishes with a drier and less sweet ending that I would like.
Strange one this, it has some characteristics that one would obviously associate with the style, but then again it seems to lack the classic sweetness."
Mad River Brewing Company,Double Dread Imperial Red Ale,,,American Amber / Red Ale,8.60%,bottle,2.28,3,2,2.5,2,2,12/21/2010,"12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Gusher from the bottle that leads to an ugly pour. Murky reddish brown with large specks of yeast floaties in huge quantities. This beer is obviously struggling through either an excess of bottle-conditioning, the lack of filtration or some other final stage issues.
Given the amount of foam that gushes from the bottle, the head and lace a woefully disappointing.
Nose and tastes give an overly aggressive bitter, hop note that tastes like an American Barleywine or DIPA gone wrong. It tastes something like an Arrogant Bastard clone that was made by a poorly skilled homebrewer. Odd aftertaste too. Odd mouthfeel comes with the excessive carbonation of the body.
This may be my first beer from Mad River and it's a very poor introduction. Lack of balance, huge, nondescript poorly managed flavors, and the suspicion of some kind of inability to package the beer correctly. Off-flavors of hop soaked cardboard as well.
Nasty."
Tyranena Brewing Company,Stone Tepee Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),5.80%,bottle,3.6,4,2,4,4,4,12/21/2010,"12 oz bottle, usual stubbie presentation from Tyranena, thanks go out to Kevin for a chance to crack this one.
Honey orange color on the pour with a pleasing white head. The beer is capped with a frothy layer of thick bubbles and the head provides some nice, inviting lace.
Nose seems very weak and has me worried. It seems as though this beer has potential to be extremely light on flavor if the nose ids anything to go by.
I need not have worried. The tastes provide a really quite aggressive, fresh hop explosion. This is surprising for two reasons. First the nose did not give any of this away at all, and secondly it's not the kind of bitterness and depth of flavor that one usually associates with the style. Some fruit notes underpin the hoppy blast and beer comes together to give a very satisfying experience. Some soap notes amongst the hops as well. The toasty, pale grains support the beer nicely, and to be frank I'm pretty impressed.
More depth of character and flavor than one is used to with the style, so in that respect and exciting beer to drink. Good stuff."
Tyranena Brewing Company,Rocky's Revenge Bourbon Brown,,,American Brown Ale,6.00%,bottle,3.45,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,12/21/2010,"12 oz bottle, usual stubbie presentation from Tyranena, thanks go out to Kevin for a chance to crack this one.
Fairly innocuous looking, mid-brown pour with some creamy head but not much lace.
Nose and taste reveal quite a lot of the bourbon character, in fact a bit more than I was expecting. I'm not a huge fan of bourbon aged beers, but an American Brown Ale does at least seem like a sensible place to put such a thing, and this works fairly well. The bourbon notes are not exactly strong, but they do make a fairly steady appearance all the way through the drink. They also have the effect of tempering any overtly hoppy note that the American versions of brown ales tend to give. For me that's a really good thing, since the last thing I want in a creamy, smooth brown ale is a bunch of in your face hops. As much as I'm not keen on bourbon in my beer, if we are talking about a brown ale then it is a preferable flavor than a bunch of aggressive bitterness.
Smooth with a few other liquor (rum) tastes too, I like this a little more than I thought I might. It does feel a little thin to me, and that seems to be the one ""faulty"" area.
Having said all of that, I bet if you enjoy bourbon aged beers then this beer is one that you will enjoy."
Tyranena Brewing Company,Chief BlackHawk Porter,,,American Porter,5.60%,bottle,3.25,3.5,3,3.5,3,3,12/21/2010,"12 oz bottle, usual stubbie presentation from Tyranena, thanks go out to Kevin for a chance to crack this one.
Surprisingly black pour with little or no brown elements that one often sees with porters. Head and lace are frankly both a little disappointing even if they are a nice mocha color.
The nose reveals a touch of coffee but not any bitterness or hop character to speak of. I like my porters, mild, smooth and creamy and although Blackhawk hits to some degree on each of these attributes, ultimately I feel it misses the boat slightly. Some very mild char and a touch of acidity or sourness that one might attribute more to a stout.
Some more light, bitter coffee grinds in the finish, but otherwise a somewhat ""ordinary"" experience. Perhaps fresh, closer to the source and on tap I might like this more, but for now it's a beer that i could frankly take or leave."
New Belgium Brewing,Lips Of Faith Vrienden (Allagash Collaboration),,,American Wild Ale,8.50%,bottle,4.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,12/20/2010,"22 oz bottle in the usual Lips of Faith presentation.
Pour is a good looking, light, bright copper hue with some sticky, complex lace. Head is small and leaves just a ring around the extremities of the beer. Clarity is excellent, carbonation medium.
Essentially, if you've ever had an English, west country cider you will have had an experience mightily similar to this.
Nose and tastes reveal some fairly straightforward and simple light apple and cherry acidity that offer a pretty gentle introduction to a touch of light Brett and funk. the nose suggest a little more acidity than the taste ultimately delivers. Acidity is low, but present enough to let you know that you are drinking something that is a bit different. The apple and cherry notes become more fruity s the beer warms and the drinkability is high. 
The beer has a very refreshing, light touch and in that respect reminds me a little of a cider like Strongbow. Slightly less aggressive than that drink, and perhaps lower carbonation and hence a bit smoother.
Simple and that's its beauty. A great way to introduce a new, but LIGHT acid/sour/brett/funk experience to those with little or no knowledge of such things that will break them in gently without too much aggression."
Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,Namaste,,,Witbier,5.00%,bottle,3.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,12/19/2010,"Many thanks go out to finewinemike for a chance to try this beer. Came as part of my Secret Santa for 2010.
I guess that this is a somewhat atypical Dogfish Head beer in as much as it is somewhat typical for the style! Nothing really very outlandish here at all, all quite ""normal"".
A honey body sits underneath a tight, fine, dense white head. Nice lace.
The nose and tastes are very floral with the emphasis on the lemongrass rather than the orange peel or coriander. The body and mouthfeel are both very full and smooth and quite surprisingly so as the style can sometimes be a little light. Sensible ABV for a change, too.
I don't know how much this cost, so the value is a bit lost on me, but it's very nice, lemongrass based Wit that will delight those that enjoy the style."
Minhas Craft Brewery,Minhas Swiss Style Amber,,,American Amber / Red Ale,?,bottle,2.35,3,3,2,2,2.5,12/19/2010,"12 oz single, mnay thanks go out to Kevin for the chance to try this beer.
Not sure what a ""Swiss Amber"" really is, but I'll try anything once!
Pour is a light, orange, maber body with below average head and lace. Nothing much to report.
The beer is essentially a Vienna Lager in terms of the way it drinks. Sweet, malty, pretty much no hop character and a watery mouthfeel. The dry element is just about the only way that it resembles the style, and if you are looking for any type of significant hop-based experience, forget it.
The thin mouthfeel is accompanied by a cardboard taste. Pretty poor."
Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Co.,Burger Classic,,,American Adjunct Lager,?,can,3.33,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,12/18/2010,"12 oz can courtesy of Kevin - thanks again!
Orangey, yellow pour with some pretty fierce carbonation. The head that forms initially is very high, fluffy and white. It fades quickly though to give nothing more than a tiny film on the surface of the beer and one or two wisps of lace.
Little to report here other than a pretty sweet, thin beer that to be honest I don't mind too much. It has a lemony aroma but not much of that is transferred to the taste. Some acidity and fairly drinkable given the style circumstances.
The pale malts are the feature here and they support the beer quite well. Not devoid of taste and the can is a bonus."
Terrapin Beer Company,Terrapin Big Daddy Vlady's Russian Imperial Stout,,,Russian Imperial Stout,10.30%,bottle,2.25,4,3,2,2.5,1.5,12/16/2010,"22 oz bottle in the usual Side Project presentation, this is #13.
$7.49 for the bottle. The latest in the deluge of beer that is coming out of Terrapin these days (with mixed results I might add).
Standard jet black pour with a smallish head. There is a distinct lack of body. The beer really is quite thin.
The beer pulls together an odd combination of attributes. It's quite sweet but it brings a terribly unrelenting solvent alcohol presence. The roasty sweetness that IS there and threatens to be a nice taste that the beer COULD hand its hat on, is once again overwhelmed by the rubbing alcohol/methylated spirits and paint thinner keep on coming through over and over again. Horrible, nasty burn that results in a drain pour for the second half of the bottle.
Oddly, the solvents are not so noticeable in the nose.
This really isn't very good. It feels unfinished and is no more than an solvent alcohol bomb. Not good."
Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),LongShot Old Ben Ale,,,Old Ale,9.00%,bottle,3.68,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,12/12/2010,"12 oz single from the Longshot pack.
A nice looking pour that gives a simple, brown, clear beer with some pretty good carbonation considering the ABV. Head and lace are both adequate and better than I anticipated.
This beer is nowhere near as intense as I was expecting, which may be due to the age of the beer. It has probably calmed down a bit since it was first bottled.
Nose and tastes are pretty straightforward. Light alcohol amongst the sweet sugars (brown) and some simple raisin like notes. The beer is a bit drier and a bit less aggressive than I was expecting though. Not overly sweet, and quite muted in several areas.
Very easy drinking, and surprisingly mellow."
Hoppin' Frog Brewery,Frosted Frog Christmas Ale,,,Winter Warmer,8.60%,bottle,3.7,3.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,12/12/2010,"22 oz bottle from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
The pour is a very attractive garnet colored pour with a smallish head that eventually forms a light, mocha colored spotty film on the surface of the beer. No lace to speak of.
The nose delivers a HUGE blast of cinnamon. Not subtle, not restrained and a little off-putting.
The tastes follow suit with some large cardamon, cinnamon and ginger elements all present. Underneath it all there are some caramel malts, but the spices are extremely dominant and also add a bit of herbal quality as well. There isn't much here outside of the spices but I'm not sure that they were trying to do much else. Alcohol well hidden.
This strikes me as a mood beer. If you are in the festive mood and want to indulge in a beer that reflects spicy, winter warmer type scene, then you would probably go for this. Outside of that context this could become a bit of an effort and you could tire of it very quickly indeed."
Sprecher Brewing Company,Pipers Scotch-Style Ale,,,Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy,8.30%,bottle,4.23,4,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,12/12/2010,"12 oz, single stubbie in the usual, Sprecher presentation. Beer courtesy of Kevin - many thanks.
Pour provides a reddish, brown hue with some really nice head and lace. The head is pretty thick and produces a lot of sticky residue.
Nose and tastes deliver a LOT of peat! A very smoky experience indeed, and not one that I was expecting. Having said that it does grow on me as I consume the beer, but it's a bit of a shock at first. I would call it bracing!
Obviously amongst the smoke and peat is a beer that is simply malt based with some caramel undertones with the sweetness. Very tasty and packed full of flavor.
Sprecher make some really fantastic beer on the malt end of the spectrum and this is no exception. Certainly pushing the peat notes to the absolute maximum for me, the beer is not quite as drinkable as I would like (because of the peat), but still maintains a high level of quality."
Stone Brewing Co.,Lukcy Basartd Ale,,,American Strong Ale,8.50%,bottle,3.45,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,12/12/2010,"22 oz bottle from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Magnificent clarity on the garnet pour with a head that is initially good but fades quite quickly. A little lace. The color is very attractive.
There's a big, 'ole piney West Coast nose upfront with this one. Quite herbal too.
Tastes are largely as expected with drying hops, aggressive bitterness and some hot alcohol, but this beer lacks the richness and complete, malt intensity that the other Bastards do. It feels like Arrogant Lite, and the mouthfeel matches the lighter feel. The lack of malt depth is what really distinguishes this beer from the other, similar beers that Stone brews. It has a strange, floral or herbal note that is a little off-putting. Quite surprised at how the hops seem to add pine and green herbal notes rather than straight up bitterness.
Not a beer I care for much, and given the excellence of Arrogant Bastard this is a beer that is difficult to purchase when the others are out there. One and done here."
"Inveralmond Brewery Ltd., The",Santa's Swallie,,,Scottish Ale,4.30%,bottle,4.33,4.5,4.5,4,4,5,12/11/2010,"500 mL bottle from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour delivers a classic, English Pale Ale appearance with a slightly clouded, light amber hue with a spotty head that produces some nice retention and some sticky lace. All is well with the appearance.
Nose offers some lovely malt notes that have depth, plus a pronounced, buttery, toasty aroma. Nice.
Tastes reflect the nose and also bring a slight, light-rum character. NOT boozy, but it does have some raisin and bready notes. Short finish which is quite dry for the the level of malts that are present and defies the origin of the beer. Any sice notes (nutmeg and cinnamon are mentioned on the label) are extremely subtle, and that's one of the strengths here.
For intents and purposes this drinks like an English Pale Ale, and if you are anticipating a Scotch Ale or a Winter Warmer, forget it. Simple biscuit malts with hop character that adds a degree of unexpected bitterness is the real element here, and it tastes very good. Subtle, refined and gentle, many will miss the charm and sophistication of this beer."
Jailhouse Brewing Company,Slammer Wheat,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,5.00%,bottle,4.25,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,12/11/2010,"22 oz bottle from Hop City, GA, USA.
Nice presentation, I like the artwork, and having been to the brewery it certain is in keeping with the branding that they are looking for.
I first tasted this beer way back in February or march of this year when I visited the brewery. I thoroughly enjoyed it then, so i was delighted to see that the bottles had finally made it out a couple of weeks ago - good stuff.
A honey colored, orange pour with nice cloudiness, a decent yeast sediment that makes its way into the Tucher Weizen 0.5 L glass and produces a light, non-dense head with a touch of lace.
The nose offers some sharp, fruity acidity and this is what we find in the initial tastes, too. Light citrus notes are the main feature here. A higher hop profile that perhaps is usual for the style, and all in all this beer has a MUCH deeper presence and depth than is usual for the style. Impressively brewed, Slammer Wheat seems to go well beyond the parameters of the style and to a heavier ""more present"" mouthfeel. A few soapy notes that become quite a feature of the taste.
Definitely a beer that packs a good punch and fights well above its own style-weight. tasty, drinkable and a welcome addition to the local scene."
Moa Brewing Company,Moa Noir,,,Euro Dark Lager,5.50%,bottle,3.55,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,12/11/2010,"Hazy, reddish-brown pour with a small one finger head and very little lace or retention.
Nose and tastes are simple and slightly nutty. In that respect the first impression of this beer are much more in the brown ale area of things rather than as a dark lager. As things progress (warm), the beer does take on some cleaner and more bitter edges and the malt sweetness fades somewhat.
There is no doubt that there is a degree of bakers chocolate in the tastes in addition to a touch of cocoa. A pretty dry beer considering the malt content. Chocolate actual builds quite a bit over the course of the bottle
Quite full in the mouth, the beer is very smooth and leaves a slight coating on the tongue and teeth.
Mildly interesting distraction but not one that I would seek out again."
Gordash Brewing Company,Panic Attack,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,10.00%,bottle,3.65,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,12/10/2010,"12 oz single, Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
When a beer has the generic words, ""Belgian Style Ale"" on the label it makes me nervous. When it's from the Holy Mackerel stable as well, it makes me even more wary, and to be honest I do not have high hopes for this beer before I open it.
A copper hue with a decent amount of lace and some creamy head that sits on top of the brew,
Firstly this is NOT, by any stretch of the imagination a beer that should be categorized as a Belgian Strong Dark. It fails to fit that category on a whole bunch of levels. For all intents and purposes this is a, ""slightly darker than normal"", Tripel.
The nose and tastes deliver most of the classic Tripel elements; a viscous body, plenty of sweetness, some fruit esters (pineapple) and a BIG dose of alcohol. In the back end there is a really interesting blast of herbal, juniper tastes and some bubble gum. The Tripel notes are backed up with some white pepper in the finish. A touch of honey in the sweetness and a little caramel and banana round things out. The bubblegum notes that come with some Tripels are subdued.
It's all there for a Tripel (with the exception of a light copper color rather than a bright, golden one) but ""Tripel"" is the benchmark that will tell you where this beer is coming from and how it drinks.
Quite tasty, and much more enjoyable than I was expecting, but this is a beer that you will want to drink in small quantities!"
"August Schell Brewing Co., Inc.",FireBrick,,,Vienna Lager,5.00%,bottle,2.75,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,3,12/9/2010,"12 oz bottle, thanks go out to Kevin for the chance to try this.
A mid-amber, cloudy pour with a thin head that produces some attractive if somewhat thin lace. The lace is a little watery, but is quite intricate. 
Bready, malt based combo of nose and tastes lead one into a fairly authentic Vienna lager taste. Pretty light in the mouth which may seem like a good thing, but to be honest it feels a bit thin and watery. More bread and sweetness in the back end and finish. Carbonation is pretty lively and introduces a little prickle. Amongst it all is a touch of fruit, but not much.
OK but heaps of better examples of the style out there, and as a result I'd pass."
Dave's BrewFarm,BrewFarm Select,,,American Pale Lager,5.50%,can,3.18,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,12/9/2010,"12 oz can, many thanks to Kevin for the opportunity to try this one.
Golden, clear, macro-like pour with a decent, fluffy head. Some retention and some attractive lace but otherwise largely unremarkable.
Grainy, buttered toast on the nose with some slight grassy hop aroma - not much at all, even on warming.
Tastes offer an organic-like experience with a clean bill of malts making up the majority of the tastes. Some more light hay and grass but it never really adds up to much. Not much depth here, and I suppose that's OK, but the beer ultimately remains pretty ordinary. ""Sweet"" and ""clean"" are attributes in its favor, but not much else is. Good beer for some outdoor drinking in warmer weather I suppose.
Fine, but ultimately another beer in a unremarkable category."
Wild Heaven Craft Beers,Ode To Mercy,,,American Brown Ale,8.20%,on-tap,3,4,4,3,2.5,2,12/7/2010,"On-tap at Taco Mac in Douglasville, GA, USA.
Pour is a good looking, dark brown color with some nice clarity. Carbonation is relatively low which seems appropriate. Small head with some spotty film on the surface and a little lace. A little thin.
I read a couple of reviews of this beer which described a coffee note to the beer which to be honest I took with a pinch of salt. ""Coffee"" taste is one of those default, fallback tastes that I think people sometimes imagine in Stouts and Porters and other ""dark"" beers, and in a Brown Ale it seemed a little unlikely; in reality it was spot on!
Quite a lot of coffee in the nose and also in the initial tastes. The coffee settles down a bit and the beer goes into ""Brown Ale mode"" with a little nuttiness and some deeper malts. All of that is fine and dandy and it's quite nice, but the problem here is the alcohol. It seems to bump heads with the relatively subtle style, and with the mouthfeel being quite thin, it takes on a solvent aggression that grates on me very quickly. 
I suppose that Imperial Brown Ales are OK, but to me it gets tedious and drinking is not easy. This beer lacks the depth to hold up so much alcohol and in the end it gets quite solvent-like.
A potentially tasty profile spoiled by too much alcohol."
New Belgium Brewing,Lips Of Faith Sahti,,,Sahti,7.20%,bottle,4.23,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,12/6/2010,"22 oz bottle.
Pour is a very, very good looking golden orange body with a wispy, thinnish head. Not much retention, some lace.
Nose has plenty of sweet malts and perhaps a whiff of solvent like alcohol. Not very well defined as far as I could make out.
Tastes are built around that of a malty, relatively high gravity lager with some lemongrass notes. There is little or no juniper character, and the beer reminds me a bit of a watery Maibock. It really doesn't have a lot of body but in one way that makes it more drinkable. The alcohol seems to build over the length of the beer, or at least the alcohol TASTE, builds. There is a little bitterness in the far back end but it is pretty minute.
The bottle mentions the lemon peel, but it also says the beer is ""hazy"" which under absolutely NO circumstances is it.
Interesting beer that is drinkable, pretty light and a beer that appeals to my malty side and the fact I like a beer with good clarity and color."
Left Hand Brewing Company,Fade To Black Volume 1 - Foreign Export Stout,,,Foreign / Export Stout,8.50%,bottle,3.75,4.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,12/2/2010,"12 oz single.
Been holding on to this one since the original release. Time to have a crack at it now.
Pour is an impressive jet black body with a tight head of very fine bubbles. Nice looking head and decent retention and lace.
Nose releases some bready malts and not a lot else.
Tastes release some very light alcohol notes amongst the very lightly charred, dark chocolate. A little bitterness that is the source of the slightly dry character. The dryness doesn't really ever get very high, which I suppose keeps it out of the Irish/Dry Stout category. A light, metallic bitterness lingers for a while on the palate as well.
Th body achieves the unusual, but welcome, combination of being pretty light but also creamy. Unusual to get hat combo pulled off. 
Alcohol pretty well hidden to be honest.
Extremely drinkable, in part because of the relative lightness of the body, but either way it goes down very easily."
Founders Brewing Company,Founders Nemesis 2010,,,American Barleywine,12.00%,bottle,2.5,4,4,2,2,2,12/1/2010,"12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Meh, when beer gets like this for me it essentially ceases to become beer and turns into an experience that is simply too much like hard work. You have to really work at this beer to appreciate it and drink it, and for me that begins to detract from the point of ""having a beer"".
It's a VERY high octane product no matter how one looks at it, and a beer like this could ONLY be brewed in America, or least by a brewer with a colossal American influence.
Pour is an attractive, reddish brown highlighted black, with a decent mocha head and a little lace and retention. The head has a coffee color to it.
The initial aromas are really quite sweet, and offer a boozy malt bomb that put s one in mind of an English Barleywine. When one considers the appearance and nose, all is well. The tastes are a different matter though.
What starts off as a reflection on the nose (sugary sweetness, lots of malts and plenty of booze), about half way through a vicious bitterness, led by unrelenting citrus and pine-needle base based hops, cuts right across the palate. It ends up being a puckeringly dry, charcoal based nastiness that coats the tongue and not in a good way. Some wood, some drying sawdust and a everlasting bitterness that dries the tongue and palate for scores of minutes after the beer is finished. Alcohol arrives in a loud shirt and wears its sunglasses indoors. Hot and unsophisticated in the extreme.
Rough around he edges, this beer screams aggression and frankly has all the hallmarks of beer that is trying to be a noisy, brash, uninvited party goer without much class.
Horrible finish and aftertaste, takes the beer from a smooth start to an almost unrecognizable ending. Impossible to drink more than maybe 18-10 of the 12 oz, this beer also represents absolutely APPALLING value. All that's bad about contemporary, American craft beer."
"Peak Organic Brewing Company, LLC",Maple Oat Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),5.20%,bottle,4.2,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,12/1/2010,"12 oz single from Hop City a few weeks ago.
Pour is a hazy, honey colored amber with a fluffy white head and some persistent lace.
Aroma is pretty sweet with plenty of maple syrup notes, some more honey and brown sugar.
All of these aroma characters come together in the taste to produce a real, sugar sweet, malt bomb. Finish offers a little hop bite, but it's generally lost amongst the sweetness. Aftertaste lingers a little.
Mouthfeel is pretty rich and reflects the sugar nature of the beer. Quite full and a little viscous.
Very tasty with the honey like elements but you're going to need to enjoy a sweet beer to make much sense of this."
Cigar City Brewing,Marshal Zhukov's Imperial Stout,,,Russian Imperial Stout,11.50%,bottle,3.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,11/27/2010,"750 mL bottle from Total Wine in Jacksonville, FL.
OK, small hiss/fizz as the cap is prized off, in a moment you'll see why that detail is relevant.
Pour gives a rich looking, thick, jet-black body with a few very dark brown highlights at the edges. The beer leaves some very impressive, tobacco colored film/oil on the inside of the glass like alcohol legs that cover the whole surface of the vessel. Impressive. ZERO head. ZERO lace.
Nose gives a really sweet, alcohol based aroma with some serious chocolate and malt notes. There is also a little smoke (see more later).
The tastes reflect the nose and are very rich and sweet. The chocolate, alcohol based notes are defined by their extravagance and richness, but they also come with a smokiness and a little acidity. Sweetness upfront and some charred notes in the back end.
Here's the rub - ZERO and I mean ZERO carbonation. Not just a beer with relatively low carbonation that we would expect, but basically a completely flat experience - like milk. In fact, the beer kind of reminds me of an alcohol laced, dark chocolate milkshake. Flat.
The aftertaste leaves a little coffee-grind bitterness which also has a slightly charred, charcoal based molasses.
I have a feeling that this bottle has somehow become ""uncarbonated"". Seems unlikely, but there really is no other explanation. There was a very small hiss as the beer opened but the lack of ANY CO2 seems odd. I couldn't even generate any head with a massively aggressive pour. Despite the lack of carbonation the beer still feels slick and rich in the mouth and is in no way thin.
Email sent to brewery out of curiosity."
Great Lakes Brewing Company,Great Lakes The Wright Pils,,,Czech Pilsener,5.30%,bottle,3.08,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,11/27/2010,"12 oz single - many thanks go out to Micah for the chance to crack this one. Only from the brewery? Not sure, but that's what I remember hearing.
Typical Pils appearance with a light golden body and a wispy head. the head lacks much presence for me.
The nose and tastes are in the right ballpark, but a re a little too sweet for my liking when I consider the style. I like my Pils to have a really strong Noble/Saaz bite especially in the finish, and although this beer delivers some of that, it doesn't really come through strong., there are quite a few residual sugars there which conflict a little with the bitterness that I am seeking.
Simple and drinkable with a little hop, soapy character which is good, but the beer lacks in in your face bitter punch in the finish and ultimately just feels too sweet for me. I need more soap and a lot more brutality in the ending.
Not bad, but a long way from the best GL brew."
New Glarus Brewing Company,Totally Naked,,,American Pale Lager,4.30%,bottle,3.33,4,3,3.5,3.5,3,11/27/2010,"12 oz single, many thanks go out to Kevin for the chance to try this beer.
Pour is a well carbonated, totally clear light straw color with a huge, fluffy and sticky head. Lace is pretty good too. Color is a little light, but otherwise looks pretty good.
Nice carbonation leads to a lively mouthfeel.
Nose is a little corny and vegetal to be honest, and does not inspire much confidence.
The tastes are citrusy. Some lemongrass but it is quite watery. The back-end and finish are very short, but it is clean with almost zero aftertaste. More slight, shandy-like lemon tastes fall into place.
Drinkability and thirst quenching notes are high, but outside of that the beer lacks much depth. It's really VERY light, and in that respect perhaps a good beer to introduce the BMC crowd to a new brewer."
Innis & Gunn,Rum Cask Oak Aged Beer,,,Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy,7.40%,bottle,4.35,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,11/26/2010,"11.2 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA. recently in four packs in Atlanta.
Clear bottle presentation with the blue accents makes a very attractive proposition.
The color of this beer is truly a sight to behold. Beautiful clarity on the pour and a copper/red/burgandy body sits underneath a white head. Some lace and a fine film forms on the surface of the shimmering body.
Nose is surprisingly muted to be honest. Even on warming the liquor aspect is not strong to me (although it is certainly there), rather we get a slightly acidic, apple based note.
Similarly the tastes are not quite a huge as I thought that they may be. For some that may seem problematic, but for me it's the contrary. This really is quite a subtle beer, and had this been inspired elsewhere, the rum notes could have been overwhelming. As it is, it's pretty light. Sweet, mellow and surprisingly light and drinkable, the beer actually screams subtlety which is not how it could have turned out. Low carbonation which works well, and the dryish rum notes build over the glass, but ultimately still work swell with only a slight warming alcohol effect. For me the oak character is really pretty reserved and light.
Very enjoyable and it has a drinkability that is much higher than I was anticipating. Tasty and easy drinking."
Southern Tier Brewing Company,Old Man (Winter Ale),,,Old Ale,7.20%,on-tap,4,4,4,4,4,4,11/26/2010,"This is NOT an Old Ale in my book. I was actually expecting it to be labeled as a Winter Warmer, but it drinks more like an American IPA.
On tap at The Irish Bred Pub in Douglasville, GA, USA.
Great looking pour with the deep copper, mahogany body showing superb clarity underneath a bone-white head. Head is not terribly well maintained, but there is some decent lacing.
Nose gives up some fresh, raw hops.
The beer is much hoppier than I was expecting and this is the abiding memory. Some good levels of bitterness that makes the beer drink like a freshly hopped, American IPA. Some citrus notes and pretty, green and fresh feel about the beer. Malts are present in quantities that hold the whole thing together nicely. Alcohol is well hidden and beer drinks lower than the ABV would suggest it might.
Not exactly what I expected, but at the same time I was pleasantly surprised and found the beer both refreshing and moreish.
Good stuff, better than expected."
Harpoon Brewery,Harpoon Leviathan - Triticus,,,Wheatwine,11.50%,bottle,4.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,11/25/2010,"12 oz bottle , courtesy of shogokawada.
Pour is a very rich looking, black color but does not have too much viscosity. Thin, creamy film forms on the surface of the beer.
Initial tastes give some nice chocolate malts and a healthy does of booze. These are the main competing/complementing factors. As the beer warms we get more and more liquor and sherry notes and the brew really starts to come into its own. As expected the nose starts to develop with warmth, too; a malt bomb laced with somewhat menacing alcohol.
Although the alcohol based malt is the obvious main factor here, there is a jarring hop bitterness that never leaves. It lingers, and makes itself especially known in the finish. Still, the beer is definitely sweet and nicely balanced considering the massive nature of many of the elements.
This beer remains a brooding, latently aggressive beer but also has style and presence.
A truly great beer when I tasted the original many years ago, and this maintains much of those characteristics. Strong and bold, this is not for the feint of heart."
Pretty Things Beer & Ale Project,Hedgerow Bitter,,,English Pale Ale,5.40%,bottle,3.2,3,3.5,3,4,3,11/25/2010,"22 oz bottle, thanks go out to Shogokawada for the chance to try this. Bottled Aug 2010, 1st Batch.
Pour is a pretty light amber color with plenty of orange color. Quite hazed. A little head, a tiny bit of lace but not much retention. It looks a bit muddy.
The nose does not give way to any hop character, rather it gives a simple, malt sweetness and not a great deal more.
The tastes are intensely bitter in several areas. The front end is not too intense, but the middle, back end and finish are really quite shrap. It's not subtle at all. Strange really, becasue the beer is held togeher by a decent, biscuit like, English malt framework, but the beer also deviates fairly dramatically from highly hopped version of an English Ale (which is what one might think this would resemble).
The bitterness is obviously the feature here, and that's all well and good, but to me it sits a little awkwardly against the malt bill that it is coupled with. It's just not especially drinkable for me, and it seems as if there are two separate, competing factors. Not bad, just a bit awkward. For me, it gets caught between an English Pale Ale and West Coast hop bomb. Weird."
Trader Joe's Brewing Company,Trader Joe's 2010 Vintage Ale,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,9.20%,bottle,4.48,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,11/25/2010,"A release that I look forward to every year for two reasons; the value associated with this beer is generally exceptional, and Unibroue is simply a brewer that rarely misses when it plays in its own, Canadian inspired, ""Belgian"" ballpark.
Corked & Caged 750 mL in the usual Unibroue style bottle, with a blue ""U"" on top of the cap that is reassuring. Best Before date on the rear of the bottle, 09-10-2013. J221 01 953Q dot-matrixed on the shoulder of the bottle at the side.
A very dark brown body which, in less than strong light appears largely just black. Head is a mocha color, that fades fairly quickly to leave a collar and a thin film on the beer.
Nose has some lightly spiced fruit.
The tastes are based on the same light fruit and spice as the nose. The spice builds with warmth and as the bottle is consumed. White pepper is present, alongside a touch of aniseed. Perhaps a dash of pumpkin or cardamon. Some mace and some more obvious nutmeg. Even some carrot cake. Not much alcohol at all, and a nice, slightly lingering bitterness related to orange peel in the back end and finish. A few of the typical Unibroue yeast notes, but it seems a bit more muted than in many of their other beers. The yeast does get a bit bigger as it warms, as does a dash of wintergreen. 
The mouthfeel is lively and makes the beer feel much lighter than it otherwise might be.
Very satisfying, moreish and tasty as usual. Exceptional value. Great stuff."
De Proefbrouwerij (bvba Andelot),Monstre Rouge,,,Flanders Red Ale,8.50%,bottle,1.95,2,2,2,2.5,1.5,11/23/2010,"*SHRUG*
I have literally no idea what is going on here. If the attempt was to make a Flanders Red then this is a complete failure. If they wanted to produce a slightly watered down version of a DIPA, then success!
$14.99 (at least), in some locations even more expensive, for the 750 mL (plastic) corked and caged bottle. Cork is very difficult to remove.
Beer pours an ugly, murky brown that looks like tea. Head is initially good, but fades very quickly to give a thin white film on the top of the beer. Watery lace on the side of the glass. 
Nose has some watery hops, and not much else. The beer delivers a watered down hop taste like a bad DIPA homebrew. There is nothing more to this beer, other than a bit of alcohol in the finish. Water herbal notes make up the aftertaste. A bit of dryish, woody oak there too but it also seems like a mistake.
ZERO Flanders Red character and a bad, bad DIPA on top of that.
Since I heard about this collaboration years ago I was excited for this brew. After it came out and I heard that people were disappointed, I thought I would leave it to see if any Flanders Red character developed - it didn't. 
Total write-off and I am amazed that these two breweries allowed this beer to be inflicted on the public. Awful. Drain-poured a fair amount of it.

Red Brick Brewing Company,Long John Ale,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,8.20%,bottle,3.43,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,11/21/2010,"12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Word on the street is that this is essentially the same beer as this; http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/864/46125
but the beer has been ""tweaked"" a little in terms of the recipe, and (obviously) it has been re-branded as part of Red Brick's image overhaul.
The pour gives a nice, mahogany body with some light chill haze. The head is tan and light and bubbly. Retention and lace are below average.
WOW! The nose and tastes are ENORMOUS bubble-gum and fruity banana. ""Strong"" is NOT the word, it's an astonishingly powerful, sweet assault. There are some underlying almond notes, but these almonds a sugar coated! We then get a massive array of esters that follow through in the middle and the back end. Pineapple, pears and other tropical fruits are there too. Some alcohol that warms in the chest on the way down. A little slick in the mouth.
The finish is amazingly short considering the early assault, and the beer does not linger in the aftertaste as one may have though after the initial blast. Something to age? This needs to settle down a bit.
There isn't much subtle about this beer, and I suppose that's OK, but this beer will not please anyone who does not like a very sweet, fruity, Belgian style beer. I DO like this kind of beer, but to be honest this thing is really MUCH too over the top even for my, sweet-loving palate. 
The beer is not really like a BSDA at all, and I would favor the description of a fruity Dubbel, either way this is a pretty crazy beer. MUCH aggression in terms of the fruit, I bet lots of people will hat this. I don't, but it's really a borderline beer in all kinds of ways."
Appalachian Brewing Company,Mountain Lager,,,Dortmunder / Export Lager,4.50%,bottle,3.63,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,11/20/2010,"12 oz single, thanks to Micah for the chance to try this one.
No freshness date that I can see.
Nice golden clarity on the pour and a pretty high head. Head fades to leave a small collar and a little lace. Attractive.
Very strong (surprisingly so) sweet malt aroma builds from the moment it is opened. The sweetness carries into the tastes with some light hay, a bit of wet grassiness about it and a small whiff of organic notes. Appropriate, gentle carbonation. there is quite a lot of grain based sweetness here, but I like it. it lacks significant bitterness that might score it lower if we were really considering style, but it's still a tasty beer.
Clean and easy on the palate, and a nice ABV.
Quaffable and a light touch on the beer makes it a good thirst quencher. Obviously not a session beer, but one that could be consumed in fairly large amounts.
Tasty, simple and a decent introduction to this brewer."
Brouwerij Van Honsebrouck N.V.,Kasteel Cuvée Du Chateau,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,11.00%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,11/20/2010,"750 mL bottle with thick black foil (several layers!) plus a corked & caged seal. 
VERY excited to try this as I generally love the Kasteel range. You have to like REALLY sweet beers, and I do, so these beers are pretty much right up my street. This should be no exception.
Pour is a mahogany brown with a nice frothy head. Relatively short lived, but still solid. looks nice, has good clarity and is well appointed. Nice.
The aroma is a mixture of some alcohol soaked raisins and a touch of burned malt.
The beer is not as sweet nor as complex as I was expecting. In those regards it lets me down slightly, however it still tastes superb. A little warming alcohol stills on top (and at the back end of) some gentle marzipan and a fruity blast. A touch drier than I was expecting, but the alcohol seems pretty well hidden to me.
A more gentle and subtle beer than I was expecting since it did NOT deliver a massive, sweet assault on the senses but still a superb example of the style. When drinking, the alcohol is a few notches lower than 11.0 % ABV would suggest and comes together nicely, but later I really felt the full force, almost as if the sweetness were hidden, but still came back to give me a headache!"

New Belgium Brewing,Frambozen Raspberry Brown Ale,,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,6.50%,bottle,3.55,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,11/20/2010,"12 oz bottle in the usual New Belgium presentation. 20FEB11 is dot-matrixed on the label.
New Belgium has been in the GA market for sometime, but this beer is a relatively new entry. Single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour is a really attractive, dark copper brown with great clarity and a spectacular abundance of bright read highlights. Really great color. Head is initially large but fades quickly to give a little lace and some thin film across the surface of the beer.
Nose offers some light, fruity acidity and not much else.
The beer is pretty much exactly what is says it is going to be on the label; in some ways that is very encouraging. There is a pretty solid, brown ale base that offers some good malts, and on top of that we get the fruity acidity of the raspberry flavor. Both elements (raspberry and brown ale) compete for ones attention in equal degrees. Both are there, and both make an appearance, but to be honest this is also the weakness of the beer. It gets caught between the two and never really makes it as a brown ale OR as a fruit beer.
Lots of fine, reserved carbonation that makes the beer very creamy.
The color (when held up to the light) is the strongest feature, and although I don't DISLIKE it as such, it never really gets to where it needs to be as a Brown Ale or a Fruit beer.
Strange, a beer that limps to nowhere in particular but in a non-offensive manner."
New England Brewing Co.,Atlantic Amber,,,American Amber / Red Ale,5.00%,can,2.85,3.5,3,2.5,3.5,3,11/20/2010,"Retired? OK. Very recent purchase from Grassroots, Jacksonville, FL, USA. 12 oz can.
Pour is a somewhat drab drown with lots of chill haze. head is quite dense and rich and leaves a lot of sticky lace. the aroma is pretty neutral even after warming, but there are a few malt whiffs from the glass.
Caramel and light toffee notes make up the majority of the flavor profile and the beer is rather sweet. A little damp cardboard too.
Not very impressive beer and the retired factor in the BA db has me wondering how old this is. The beer seems a bit musty which is a sign of older product, but with no freshness date on the can that I can see, the review stands."
Tommyknocker Brewery,Legend,,,American Strong Ale,10.00%,bottle,4,3,4.5,4,3.5,4,11/20/2010,"$9.68 from Euro Street Market in Jacksonville Beach, FL.
The red wax on the bottle is extremely thick and a big pain in the ass to get through. 2009 vintage with the date embossed in the wax as per a seal.
The pour is pretty much un-carbonated and yields a murky, dirty brown body. Not attractive and little or no head.
Nose has an enormous amount of oak and associated liquor notes. Very good aroma. 
Tastes reflect the nose and there are a lot of residual sugars, sherry notes and some warming alcohol. Nothing that surprising, but we do get a somewhat unusual, cocoa, bakers chocolate, dry finish which is not what I was expecting. It's not really in line with the type of beer this is, but it does take the edge off the alcohol and in a strange way makes the beer more drinkable that it otherwise might be. Maple isn't really there at all.
As it warms the oak gets bigger and bigger and bigger, but the alcohol does not build much and the dry finish never lets up. A touch of tannin like bitterness at he very back end.
Body is pretty dead, but to be honest that is somewhat expected. Not full of life!
Interesting as the beer gives massive oak but also has a few elements (dry finish and light alcohol) that I would next expect."
Anchor Brewing Company,Our Special Ale 2010 (Anchor Christmas Ale),,,Winter Warmer,5.50%,bottle,3.98,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,11/19/2010,"12 oz single from my annual sixer. Usual presentation 
The usual, dark walnut brown pour with plenty of quite rich looking head. Some good looking lace as usual and the beer looks its usual, rich color.
All of the expected and normal herbal, lightly spiced notes with the emphasis on some more bitterness than in the past. Some really light licorice but a beer that seems to have less influence on the fruity side of things. A little bit of sweet and sour on the back end.
Mouthfeel does not seem quite as rich as it has in the past either, but of course this whole thing is somewhat based upon memory when thinking about comparing years.
Not much to report here. Simply a beer that I enjoy a few bottles of at this time of year and will lay a couple down to continue to build a vertical of sorts."
New England Brewing Co.,Elm City Lager,,,German Pilsener,5.00%,can,3.65,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,11/19/2010,"12 oz can from Grassroots in Jacksonville, GA, USA.
The beer has a somewhat disturbingly, pale color and in terms of the hue looks a bit weak. Paradoxically, the head is resplendent - high, fluffy and full of sticky lace, it looks really good. Admittedly it is not really a classic looking Pilsner, nor is the head typical of the style but it looks OK.
Carbonation is quite high too.
This is a very, very sweet beer that I actually like. It does NOT deliver a classic, Noble or Saaz bite (which I would want if I was concerned about style), but it is very drinkable.
Having said all of that it seems like it is closer to a macro, adjunct lager than a classic Pils, but it does have some kind of strange appeal. Perhaps the can helps, I don't know, but I bet this beer will not impress some folk. Although I like it, I would understand why other people didn't fancy it much."
Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,30th Anniversary - Grand Cru,,,American Strong Ale,9.20%,bottle,3.85,5,4,4,3,3.5,11/18/2010,"750 mL with a tight cork and cage. BIG pop on opening - take care!
The beer really does look magnificent in the DFH signature glass. There is a deep, garnet color with some super clarity, and a remarkable, high head with good lace. The head is both creamy and rocky and has an of-white color that is truly impressive.
OK, I have to admit that I was hoping that this was going to be a Belgian Dark of some description (given the Grand Cru moniker), but of course there is no reason why that should be the case, nor should I expect something like that from SN but a man can dream, can't he? Actually I got over that ""disappointment"" fairly quickly.
The nose and tastes have a lot of pretty clean, fresh, green, wet hop notes and a decent does of alcohol. To me this beer isn't really an American Strong at all (it doesn't seem to have the malt presence. The hop bitterness build and to be honest I feel as though this beer drinks much more like a west coast DIPA than anything else.
Lots of metallic green hops on the back end and the aftertastes. It's also pretty light in the mouth and doesn't offer much depth of body. That might be considered a good thing, but it's out of sync with the ABV for me.
Not a beer for me, and I think it has style issues (it seems more like a fresh hop ale to me) but there is NO doubt that it carries the SN trademarks. I suppose that can be both good and bad depending on your perspective and angle."
Mikkeller,Til Fra (To From),,,Baltic Porter,8.00%,bottle,4.03,4.5,4,4,4,4,11/14/2010,"Opening this today (11/14/10) to commemorate week #300 of NBS. This is a bottle that I received as part of my 2007 Secret Santa package from BA nlmartin over three years ago. Seems like a good moment, occasion and decision to crack this one now. Price tag says it came from ""Dilly Deli"".
750 mL bottle with gold foil on the neck, a plastic ""cork"" and cage. Small pop on opening. Undated as far as I can see, but as I say this was given to me in 2007.
Jet black body with a few reddish-brown highlights at the extremities (especially the top). Nice head that is small, but leaves a thin film on top of the beer and some broken lace. Mocha in color.
Really big, sweet alcohol hits the nose from the aroma.
Tastes are more of the same from the nose, but surprisingly the beer is VERY light and non-aggressive. Tiny notes of licorice and charcoal, but along with the (surprisingly) gentle warming alcohol, the beer is relatively simple and easy. There is very little evidence of any extensive spices here, but again that may have faded over time. Bitterness builds over the bottle and lingers a little. The bitterness comes from a dark chocolate notes.
A few notes of oxidation but the beer is in decent shape. I wouldn't want this to get much older so a pretty good decision to open this now.
I've never had this fresh, and as such I don't really know how this has matured but my guess is that time as calmed this beer quite a lot. It's really extremely mellow and I like it very much."
Cigar City Brewing,Jai Alai Cedar Aged IPA - Humidor Series,,,American IPA,7.50%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,11/13/2010,"750 mL capped bottle from a recent Jacksonville visit. Bottle label has the large ""H"" on the front as per a (newer) design than in the BA db picture.
Pour is a hazy, clouded light orange with a lovely, thick and creamy head.
The creamy nature of the beer carries forward to the mouthfeel which is quite rich.
This is one interesting beer with a LOT of white pepper and herbal notes. It's really quite medicinal amongst the strong hop base, and the beer comes together quite well. The light aniseed and floral notes are repetitive but on each mouthful there seems to be a slightly different angle which keeps the beer interesting. Perhaps a note of mixed spices as well.
To me this almost drinks like a cross between a slightly funky saison and an IPA. Weird but good. I suppose the spicy notes come from the cedar, but it's not exactly a combo that I have much experience with.
Anyway, good stuff and very drinkable."
Shmaltz Brewing Company (He'Brew),He'Brew Jewbelation Fourteen,,,American Strong Ale,14.00%,bottle,3.6,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,11/11/2010,"22 oz bottle, Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
In general I'm a massive fan of the malt-based beers that Shmaltz has been putting out in the series, and Jewbelation has been a constant source of delight for me. As a result I was excited to pick this up and to try it. Off the top this is not your typical American Barleywine, so don't expect a hoppy concoction in the bottle - that just wouldn't be a Shmaltz beer!
The pour is basically a jet black pour with a HUGE, bubbly, mocha head. Really massive. This looks like a big, American, RIS in the glass.
The nose is quite alcoholic with quite a lot of fusel alcohol but paradoxically and somewhat confusingly, a big dose of malts also cuts in.
This is a VERY hot in terms of alcohol, but not in terms of it being a hop based American Barleywine. I find many American BW's things that I do not enjoy, and many of them are very hot as well, but funnily enough this beer is just alcoholic rather than a very aggressive, nasty hop-forward beast. I'm NOT surprised in one way (since this is a Shmaltz beer), but since it is labeled as an Ameican BW it does surprise me that there is no hop presence in sight. Plenty of licorice, syrupy sweet malts, light charcoal and a small,soy sauce finish.
This is a really strange beer (it reminds me a lot of Two Turtle Doves in as much as it's a has sweet elements of a Belgian that has had candy added, but also has the licorice notes of a Belgian based stout) and it has an amalgamation of many notes. Curiously, American BW is not really one of those things.
BIG and pretty hot, this beer is a CLASSIC cellaring candidate. In fact, in recent times, it's difficult to think of a beer that would be better suited to the job. Lay it down and sit back and wait. In time this could be amazing."
SweetWater Brewing Company,Sweetwater Dank Tank Border Hopper,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,8.60%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,11/10/2010,"22 oz bottle, usual Dank Tank presentation. The usual nonsense written on the bottle (pointless) and this one comes with a similar (if not identical) green color as Wet Dream.
Very attractive clarity on the mid-orange body. Good lace, nice retention and some sticky lace.
 
Nose and taste are pretty restrained for a beer of this style. there is a lot of sweetness amongst a few typical resinous, west coast notes. The sweetness remains the dominating factor amid the clean cleans. The beer is surprisingly simple and has lots of clean lines right through to the finish.
A beer that does OK for the style, but at the same time drinks n a fairly simple manner. Alcohol is well-hidden. Tasty, easy drinking and a simple straightforward beer that works well."
"Bell's Brewery, Inc.",Bell's Christmas Ale,,,Scottish Ale,5.40%,on-tap,3.68,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,11/7/2010,"11 oz pour @ Taco Mac, East West Connector, Austell, GA, USA.
Firstly, $6.25 for the pour!! Discussed here;
http://beeradvocate.com/forum/read/3168840
Pour is an amber color with some nice clarity, good head and some nice lace. Looks tidy in the glass.
Nose gives a few notes of toffee and caramel and the tastes reflect that. The beer has a few nutty elements and is obviously and definitely malt based, but as for being a Scotch Ale I just don't get it! If you are looking for some of those classic notes, then I think you will be horribly disappointed. If you are looking for a nice, simple, wintertime beer with some good levels of malt and a generally, sweet, malt based taste profile then you may well enjoy this beer. Don't look for classic Scotch Ale notes.
The price is a whole other issue, and this may be a Taco Mac problem rather than a Bell's problem, but at $9+ a pint this is one of the worst value drinks I recall EVERY buying."
Cigar City Brewing,Sea Bass,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,8.00%,bottle,3.13,4.5,3,3,3.5,3,11/7/2010,"750 mL capped bottle, part of a recent booty haul from Jacksonville, FL.
Pour is a dark, dank looking reddish brown with some rocky, impressive looking head. LOTS of sticky lace too, a nice looking beer.
Aromas and tastes match very well. There is a VERY strong vinegar element to this beer that pushes the very boundaries of the style, and not really in a good way for me. The ethanoic acid notes are dominant, and although they diffuse over the course of the bottle, they are without question the featured taste. The beer never gets fruity or creates much in the way of traditional Saison notes, although I suppose one could definitely fir the vinegar into a ""funk"" character if one wanted to. Some dark, sour apple notes as well but not a great deal more than that. Quite aggressive and harsh.
It's almost as if this beer strays into sour territory and the brew never really smooths out very much.
This is a pretty interesting and tasty beer but it does stray a little too far from the predicted Saison/Farmhouse area for me. It's not traditional in that light in the slightest. OK, I suppose, but I find it a little annoying. Some will love this, but not really my cup of tea."
Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,My Antonia,,,American Double / Imperial Pilsner,7.50%,bottle,4.03,4.5,4,4,4,4,11/7/2010,"750 mL bottle, capped. From Total Wine in Jacksonville, FL, USA.
Typical pour into the DFH signature glass. Great looking golden pour with a large head head which is fluffy, dense and produces a lot of sticky lace. Lovely, whipped topping effect from the lace. Very thick.
Nose gives a little white pepper but also some bitter, herbal notes. Some hops in the nose. Some sinus clearing menthol.
Tastes are very interesting. Lots of Pilsner malts, but also plenty of herbal bitterness from the continuous hopping. The sweet malts are constantly competing with the bitter hops and the beer has a real battle going on between to the two extremes. The aftertaste and finish give a similar feel. A battle between the sweetness and the dry, peppery bitter notes. Finishes relatively dry for the style and does not leave a film in the mouth and is pretty clean.
I'm half expecting the alcohol to cut in more aggressively, but at 7.5% we've seen more aggressive ABV's in this style in the past, too. A little prickly nature in the mouth, but to be honest that fits right in with the style and enhances things.
Interesting beer as the typical, syrupy viscous notes that sometimes accompany this style are absent. Also the alcohol is well hidden and does not impinge upon the tastes as I have found with other impy pilsners.
Nice beer"
Minhas Craft Brewery,Berghoff Winter Ale,,,Bock,?,bottle,2.88,4,3,2.5,2.5,3.5,11/7/2010,"This beer appears to be now called simply ""Berghoff Winter Ale"".
12 oz single, thanks go out to Kevin for the chance to try this.
Pour is a very attractive, dark maroon color with a decent head and some nice lace. There is excellent clarity on the pour, and to be honest the beer looks really nice and inviting in the glass.
Nose is somewhat muted, and gives very little even on warming. A little bit of alcohol and perhaps a buttered toast whiff.
Tastes are fairly neutral but revolve around light toffee and caramel and not much else. Very little depth here and quite a thin beer in the mouth.
I could see this being a really nice beer with some work. If we could get some more depth to the caramel malts and tastes, or perhaps convert to a true Winter Warmer with some spices, we would have a half-decent offering from this ""budget"" brewer. For now though, it's a little below par. Unoffensive but not quite there, either."

MASSIVE thanks go out to Steve for the opportunity to finally get my hands on this beer. I've been trying to get hold of it since I came to the US, and until very, very recently it was generally ""not"" available here. Despite several trade attempts I never managed to get one until Steve just simply gave me one! That's an amazing piece of advocacy that I will always remember.
Color is frankly a not particularly attractive, cloudy brown, Dubbel-like brown affair. However the head and lace are both excellent and lead to a more satisfying appearance than just the color alone with give.
Nose offers some pretty strong spice that reminds me of mace.
The tastes are quite aggressive. There is a lot of licorice, aniseed and herbal like spice and it doesn't let up much. The beer is very rich, exciting and bright to me. It satisfies and is smooth and sweet. There is also some orange peel and all-spice as well. Lemony yeast and more light liquor.
Despite the Easter moniker, this beer definitely has notes and spice that are VERY winter warmer like to me and this would make a great beer to savor in a festive moment. It's a classier version of a beer like Old Fezzywig.
A classic and extraordinarily delicious beer, BUT if you don't like a rich, dark spice in your beer it would be best to avoid this!"
Thomas Creek Brewery,Thomas Creek Up The Creek,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,12.50%,bottle,4.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,11/5/2010,"12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA. This bottle has been in the cellar for several months.
I have had a few really NASTY experiences with Thomas Creek, so I approach this beer with a little trepidation to say the least. However, several people have told me that their experiences have been similar, but Up the Creek made them think again.
Off the top, the beer contradicts its ""Extreme IPA"" moniker in many ways (see below), so if you are looking for a classic, American DIPA look elsewhere.
Pour is a very attractive color indeed. A deep garnet brown that is bright, clear and really rich. Lovely looking. A thin film forms on the beer but expected virtually no lace.
It pours in a pretty viscous manner as one would expect but the beer is actually surprisingly light in the mouth for such a behemoth. In addition the tastes are really quite subtle. Plenty of malt based toffee and caramel, light touches of alcohol (well hidden) and only kisses of hop bitterness in the finish and aftertaste. Amazingly well balanced considering everything. There are a few liquor notes as well with a touch of whiskey and light peat warmth.
I am delighted that I let this sit for a while since it simply HAS to have helped the beer mellow out a little. I wasn't expecting much but got a really nice beer that I enjoyed.
This beer is the cross between an American Strong Ale and an English Barleywine. Alternate mouthfuls give me a little dry bitterness and warming, sugary, toffee alcohol warmth."
Staatliches Hofbräuhaus (Hofbräu München),Hofbräu Maibock (Urbock),,,Maibock / Helles Bock,7.20%,bottle,3.9,3,4,4,3.5,4,11/4/2010,"12 oz single from Grassroots, Jacksonville, FL, USA.
Quite a surprising orange color on the pour with very little head. The beer produces a very light film on the surface of the beer and no lace. It looks a little flat, but actually isn't once one tastes it.
Extremely malty and musty nose. Lots of organic hay and and some degree of mustiness as well.
The nose goes into the taste with a yeast based acidity being quite strong. Fruit notes peek through somewhat, but this a German based malt bomb without too much else going on for me. Perhaps a little unfair as there is a tiny hop bite on the back end. Alcohol very well hidden.
Lively mouthfeel (at times even verging on prickly), the beer is interesting enough to make the beer something that I remember.
Tasty, typically German and interesting enough to bring me back for more."
SweetWater Brewing Company,Sweetwater Crank Tank Rye'd Ale,,,Rye Beer,6.20%,bottle,3.58,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,11/4/2010,"Had this a few times in the last few weeks, this review is for the final 22 oz bottle that I will drink.
Pour is a rich looking, clear orange with some good carbonation and head and lace to match. The lace is pretty sticky. Looks solid in the glass and almost has the look of a fine Belgian Tripel.
The nose delivers the typical spicy rye notes but it is pretty restrained and much less intense than many others that use the grain. The tastes reflect the nose and its light touch as well. The beer is sweeter than many rye beers that I recall, and the malts shine through against the notoriously difficult to suppress rye elements. Not too much bitterness at all. The rye adds a creamy elements that fills out the beer somewhat. There is a substantial feel about the mouthfeel which is a combination of the tastes and a fine carbonation.
I'm just not a huge fan of rye in beer, so that's the context of this review, but this is somewhat milder than most and I like it better than nearly all of the other rye beers that I recall. I'm never going to be a ""fan"" as such, but the beer is definitely one of my favorite interpretations of the style, even if I'm not in love with it."
Terrapin Beer Company,Terrapin Moo-Hoo Chocolate Milk Stout,,,Milk / Sweet Stout,6.00%,bottle,3.73,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,11/3/2010,"12 oz bottle as part of a sixer from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Extraordinary hype has surrounded this beer in the last few weeks, and to be honest I even got a little caught up in it myself. I dislike it when that happens, but of course this is not one of those ultra-limited, one day only release affairs that I had to camp out overnight for (I'd never do that), so at least my dignity remained in tact. Anyway, on to the beer.
Into the DFH signature glass it goes.
Some slightly lighter hues at the extremities of beer that pours the color of cold, instant coffee. There is a very small head that fades quite quickly to yield a thin film on top of the beer. There isn't any lace to speak of, but the beer does leave some interesting, thinnish, alcohol legs on the inside of the glass. Obviously quite surprising given the ABV which is not all that high, and would not normally be expected to produce such an effect.
It takes quite a bit of warming in the glass before any significant nose comes through. When it does, there is a slight alcohol aroma with some very lightly roasted malts. Not very strong at any point.
The tastes deliver a touch more of the ethanol and a some very light sweet, roasted malts. I suppose there is some chocolate there but again it never gets strong. The alcohol actually builds quite a bit and gets mildly fusel.
Paradoxically the beer has a cream taste to it, but also seems thin in the mouth. Also paradoxically, a beer (and style) that you might expect to suffer if it has a thin mouthfeel, actually seems to benefit from the light touch that the mouthfeel brings. It makes it easy and very drinkable without ever getting heavy.
This is an extremely easy drinking beer, but the lack of real chocolate and quite high ethanol presence make it very interesting too, since it sits outside what I would call a typical Milk/Sweet stout and it sits outside of what it says on the bottle. It never gets really sweet, but is also never bitter. Strangely, the fusel alcohol is what stays with me.
It just never gets really creamy, milky or chocolatey which one would think could make this beer disappointing, but actually it isn't. Another paradox!"
Cigar City Brewing,Guava Grove Saison,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,8.00%,bottle,3.25,4,3.5,3,4,3,10/30/2010,"750 mL capped bottled.
Pour is a seriously hazed, butterscotch orange color with a persistent, thin film that sits atop the beer with some scant but pleasing lace.
The nose has quite a lot of ethanoic acid and is sinus clearing.
The tastes are very acidic - at least at first. It is difficult to know where this is coming from. Is it the Guava? Is it some kind of Brett infusion? Is it just a function of a farmhouse/Saison brew? The longer the beer drinks, it seems more likely that the fruit is the culprit, but nevertheless the pure acid lingers and cut across the finish as well.
There is a fine, light carbonation that breaks over the tongue and leas to a pretty nice, smooth, silky mouthfeel. I really don't detect much Belgian influence or yeast, nor do I get any significant fruit that cuts into the acid.
As in the case with this type of beer in general, the beer does get slightly less aggressive down the bottle, but there is no doubt that it still feels extremely acid based and vinegar like.
It's not an especially sour beer as such, nor is it the most tart beer that I can recall drinking, but it IS vinegar-like and it doesn't let up much.
All in all a very interesting brew, but not one I'm likely to go back to.A little too acidic for me without bringing the tartness or the edge of a Gueuze."
Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,Estate Homegrown Wet Hop Ale,,,American IPA,6.70%,bottle,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,10/30/2010,"VERY robust bottle with annoying wax over the cap. Quite an effort to get into it. $9.99 for the bottle, NOT good value.
Nice light amber pour with a smallish head but it does produce a little lace. Plenty of citrus, slightly onion-based aromas. Tastes are clean, obviously nicely hopped and straightforward but ultimately forgettable. Well balanced and refreshing, but in the end it's simply just another hop-forward Sierra Nevada beer and not much else. In that respect it seems a bit pointless to produce yet another SN clone (at least from a beer and brewing point of view) but perhaps makes a lot more sense from a marketing and profit point of view. Some light spice in the hops and it finishes a little on the dry side.
There are some floral, grassy notes in there too, and overall it does ""feel"" somewhat organic, but not it a really significant, specific or even replicable way.
Ultimately fine, but no more than a typical SN beer, but at the same time the beer does not feel (or taste) significantly different than a bunch of their other fresh/wet/hop-forward beers, and in that respect is horrible value at the price point that it seems to command - maybe the $4-5 worth of wax on each bottle send the price up!?"
Southern Tier Brewing Company,Iniquity (Imperial Black Ale),,,American Black Ale,9.00%,on-tap,3.93,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,10/30/2010,"It seems as though Southern Tier has decided to jump on the IBA bandwagon since the tap handle for this now proudly displays the letters ""iba"" in a very prominent fashion and ""Iniquity"" in much smaller font.
On tap, Taco Mac Douglasville, GA, USA. I've never seen this on tap before, but then again I've never really looked for it since this is a style that generally does not interest me much.
Pour has a couple of interesting aspects. Firstly it is black but definitely has some reddish brown highlights a the extremities, and secondly it produces a really nice, thick, creamy head (almost like a nitro-stout pour) that leaves plenty of pretty lace. It looks really good.
Nose and tastes reveal plenty of grap[efruit based, fruity citrus notes and a little pine. More ""East Coast"" than ""West coast"", which of course, is entirely appropriate. Some roasty malts too, but th ebitterness again generally comes from the hops rather than a darkened malt which again seems spot on for the style.
Finishes clean and easy.
For a style that I don't care for much at all, this was pretty good and pretty drinkable. I'd still prefer my IPA's/DIPA's to LOOK like those beers, but this replicates a bitter beer very nicely.
Having said that, not something that I would reach for very often in the future, however not a beer that you should ignore (at least once)."

Murky brown pour that lacks clarity but does produce a nice head and some significant, sticky lace.
 
Nose and tastes are very yeasty (as one would expect) and the German tasting malts come through really strong. The persistent yeast and malt tastes re the backbone of this beer and are the fundamental aspects that one would expect in the style.
Plenty of toffee and caramel notes as well make this a tasty, sweet and satisfying beer. Difficult to know where this beer would stack up in the general Dusseldorf scene, but for me it's tasty and seems to represent many of the base characteristics of the style nicely.
Tasty and drinkable, good stuff."
Lagunitas Brewing Company,A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,7.50%,bottle,3.53,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,10/28/2010,"12 oz stubbie bottle.
Good, golden clarity on the pour with an impressive amount of head and some nice sticky lace (just like that you would expect from a West Coast IPA - read on!).
Nose and tastes are ALL light grapefruit with a fairly seriously dry finish which puts this beer firmly in the American DIPA/IPA category in terms of its tastes. There is a faint fruit aftertaste and the wheat lingers a little in the background, but it is very faint and without knowing that this was supposed to be a Wheat based beer I would never, ever detect it.
There is a bit of peachy, orange floral taste in the background as well, but this is essentially drinking like a west coast IPA.
The beer does back away from the bitterness a little as one drinks the beer, but there is still a lingering feeling that you are drinking a ""C"" hop based beer."
Staatliches Hofbräuhaus (Hofbräu München),Hofbräu Oktoberfestbier,,,Märzen / Oktoberfest,6.30%,bottle,2.58,3,2,2.5,3,3,10/28/2010,"This is an EXTREMELY odd beer.
12 oz single from Grassroots, Jacksonville, FL, USA.
Pour is a somewhat alarming, yellow color that has plenty of macro notes about it but perhaps more importantly does not have the slightly darker, more orangey amber color that I was expecting. Head and lace are minimal.
The surprises continue through the nose and the tastes where there is an odd combination of Heineken-like skunk, Pilsner malts and a Saaz/Noble bitter ending. VERY peculiar indeed. The beer does have a malty start but never gets very sweet and it has an odd drying, biting finish that reminds me of a cheap, Eastern European skunky lager.
This is simply NOT my idea of a classic O'fest at all, and the beer, although not exactly nasty does leave a funny aftertaste and a very odd sense of style.
Weird, and frankly not good on a number of levels. I find it doubtful that the brewery is unaware of what this tastes like, so I am confused as to what they are trying to achieve. They certainly haven't produced a beer that I would classify as a contemporary O'fest - perhaps this is a more traditional approach?"
Rogue Brewery (Brewer's on the Bay),Chatoe Rogue First Growth Creek Ale,,,Dubbel,6.00%,bottle,4.08,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,10/26/2010,"Without question my favorite of all of the First Growth Series so far. 22 oz bottle from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, the usual First Growth presentation.
Not an especially attractive pour that generates a murky, reddish brown body, a nice, thick, creamy head but a carbonation that at first seems a little on the high side. After it all settles down it does produce a creamy feel and a less prickly mouthfeel than I first thought it might.
Nose and tastes give some gentle tartness and a really fruity feel. There is a truly fruit based cherry note but the sour element is pretty restrained. Almost sweet and sour. Not much dry character (I was half expecting some grape skins or other tannin notes that never really came on strong). Finish is satisfying with more of that restrained twang.
I like this beer a lot. Good depth of mouthfeel, a solid fruit note and a tiny, tiny tart note come together really nicely. Well rounded and a tidy beer that made me very pleased.
The other interesting thing about this beer to me is that although the BA db currently lists this as a Dubbel, AND notwithstanding the fact that there are many beers with more ""fruity"" character, nevertheless this beer STILL feels, tastes and drinks much more like a fruit beer to me than any other style."
Terrapin Beer Company,Terrapin So Fresh & So Green Green,,,American IPA,6.60%,bottle,3.18,3.5,4,3,2.5,3,10/26/2010,"22 oz bottle. Gold foil on the neck as per other Terrapin offerings.
Perfect golden clarity on the pour with some nice carbonation. Head and lace are a touch disappointing for me.
Nose and tastes are typical for the style, at least until the back end and the finish. The finish adds some fusel alcohol to the mix that I don't care for and sits especially badly in the style. Plenty of organic hop notes with serious sinus clearing capabilities, but the finish on the beer is quite boozy and beyond the, quite harsh and aggressive.
Thinnish too.
The more I drink of this the further it gets away from the style and the more the paint-thinning alcohol cuts in for me. It feels like I'm drinking a beer that is well above 6.6% every time that I swallow, and the beer seems almost like a splash of rubbing alcohol was added to top up each bottle. Some herbal/floral and medicinal character, but it never quite catches up with the alcohol.
In short the nose has a lot of the fresh hop notes that one would expect but the beer simply tastes too harsh amongst the pine and citrus notes, as if it were not finished correctly. I dunno, it just doesn't sit too well with me."
New Glarus Brewing Company,Spotted Cow,,,Cream Ale,4.80%,bottle,4.03,3.5,3,4,4.5,5,10/20/2010,"12 oz single, large thanks go out to Kevin for this one.
Golden, slightly hazed body with a nicely formed tight head. Retention and lace don't add up to much but there is some froth left on the inside of the glass.
Nose doesn't have much more than some simple, sweet grains.
Tastes are really pleasing. Sweet malts up front with a light, but lively carbonation. Very smooth and silky in the mouth. A very ""soft"" beer.The finishes adds a touch of bitterness and more sweet, light fruitiness. Tiny hints of semi-sweet apples, pears and pineapple.
Drinkability is huge for me, as the beer imparts a lovely sweetness, and little fruit and a beautifully gentle mouthfeel."
21st Amendment Brewery,Hop Crisis,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,11.80%,on-tap,4.35,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,10/15/2010,"11 oz pour at Deckard's. Their menu says 10.8% (new vintage with a different ABV perhaps?).
Golden hazed body with relatively low carbonation. Bone white head that is small but well retained and tight. Lace is very pretty.
West Coast Pine resin nose.
Tastes are simply not as aggressive as the nose might suggest. Relatively subdued for the style, the nose and the ABV. Plenty of lightly warming alcohol and some lovely, peach/grapefruit sting in the middle and back end. Lingering aniseed in the aftertaste.
This was less in your face than I was expecting, but for me that was a good thing. All the West Coast elements of the style are here, but in a sensible, relatively restrained manner. Good stuff, a beer that I savored."
"Bell's Brewery, Inc.",The Oracle,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,10.00%,bottle,3.95,4,4,4,3.5,4,10/15/2010,"12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA. 9901 dot-matrixed at the bottom of the rear label.
Typical of the style, there is a clouded, hazy orange body with a very sticky collection of head and lace at the top of the glass. Carbonation is pretty high for the type of beer we are dealing with here.
The nose is very strong, with a nice, citrusy based hop smell. However, this is NOT a West Coast, resiny aroma, it's a little gentler than that,
The tastes reflect a lot of sugary, sweet light grapefruit and even more sugar on top of that. Very sweet.
Mouthfeel is a typical, syrupy assault. Alcohol is hidden behind the sugary fruit.
All in all this is essentially a very typical beer in the style, albeit quite a fruit one and one that is relatively subtle and does not give a full on assault like a west coast equivalent. As a result the drinkability is higher than some others in style."

The beer pours with an amber hue, but it has a slight chill haze. Nice, simple white head. A little retention but not much lace.
Nose and tastes release a very strong malt base and a creamy mouthfeel. Plenty of light pineapple notes amongst the malt followed by a really quite dry, lightly hopped ending. There are some esters present but it's not what one would call ""fruity"", nevertheless some banana notes around the malty bread notes that dominate.
The dry finish is the thing that really distinguishes this beer from a typical Octoberfest or Marzen. The DEPTH of malt is not quite there for those styles, but having said that there is no need for it to do so!
Tasty, but not a beer that I'm likely to reach for again."

Pours as one would expect for a Bruin into the the Val-Dieu chalice. Minimal head that is provoked only by an aggressive pour and a brownish red body with quite a high carbonation.
All of the attributes for an Oud Bruin are there; sweet & sour notes with the emphasis on sweet, a light mouthfeel and gentle carbonation a few yeasty notes and a simple, clean aftertaste and finish to the beer.
It's a little light in the mouth and although this definitely reminds me of a Goudenband it really is a poor man's version. Having said that, it's all too infrequently that I drink this type of beer so I am happy to ""slum it"" for now.
Tasty if somewhat poor in comparison to classier versions, but nevertheless I'm happy to have it - Atlanta ain't Belgium!"

A crazy colored pour which is pale, but distinctly yellow. Not golden like some macros, but really noticeably yellow. A very sticky but quite a light and fluffy head.
Very clean malts in the nose and tastes but it comes without much Saaz like bite in the finish. The lack of distinct bitterness means it's a little off base for me. 
Extremely clean and crisp and this is really n extension of those pale, pilsner malt bills. Again the finish lacks any intensity in the hop bitterness but the whole package sits well with me, and the beer is more drinkable than I was expecting.
Ultimately I really quite enjoyed this - tasty sand very drinkable."

Curious to see what this has done in a few months.
Definitely more Belgian yeast character for me, and the grape elements seem to have dropped off quite a lot. This is not good news for me, since I really embraced them in the "
Great Divide Brewing Company,Smoked Baltic Porter,,,Baltic Porter,6.20%,bottle,3.05,4,3,3,3,3,10/13/2010,"After a really strong start to my experience with Great Divide over many years, inmore recent times there have been some very mixed results. Unfortunately, this is another relative disappointment which doesn' make the mark for me.
Pour is pretty much as expected with a low carbonated, jet black body that doesn't produce much head or lace after the initial, aggressive pour.
Requisite light, charred malts but the smoke is disappointingly restrained. I don't necessarily want a massive Rauch assault, but I DO want to get a decent amount of smoke to define the beer - frankly, it never arrives. The beer is quite sweet (which I like), but it never comes together to give a very satisfying experience for me.
This style (the smoked versions) is/are some of my favorite beers, but this one lacks the presence of say, a Left Hand Smoke Jumper (and YES I DO know there is a difference in terms of ABV for those beers)."

Quite a pop on opening, and an inky black pour. The beer is seriously black with a very small head and little retention. What head there is has a tan color.
The nose offers a light but intense roast.
Tastes are very much the same, but a few pointers;
 + ZERO Belgian character
 + Well hidden alcohol
 + Some lactose notes
 + Licorice and burned character in the aftertaste
There is an annoying and lingering aftertaste that feels a bit milky to me, and coupled wit the lack of Belgian character this beer begins to grate with me a little. If you are looking for a Belgian Stout it might be better to reach for a beer like Two Turtle Doves. There is some chocolate here but it seems muddy and ill-defined.
Ultimately a bit disappointing for me, others may like it more."

Pour is about as expected in terms of a ridiculously pale color and an alarming lack of head, retention and lace. I say ""alarming"" since this kind of beer is rarely under carbonated but this one seems lifeless - not the usual ""fizzy"" macro.
The nose and tastes are basically zero with a little grainy sweetness.
The really depressing thing about this beer is really two-fold. Firstly this is what some people thin is *beer*, and secondly other people (INCLUDING SOME BEER ADVOCATES AND PEOPLE THAT CLAIM TO KNOW BEER), think that low ABV beer has to taste like this. Neither is true. Both literally make me sad"
Brasserie de Silly S.A.,Pink Killer,,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,5.00%,bottle,3.95,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,10/11/2010,"12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Kraig tried to talk me out of this, but I KNEW that I would like it and I was glad that I went with my gut on this one.
The beer pours a hazed, peach/pinkish color with a better than expected head. There is even a tiny bit of lace and some half decent retention!
Nose has a slightly medicinal acidity.
The taste is that of a lightly sweetened grapefruit with lots of decent fruit flavor. The beer drinks incredibly easily and is really refreshing. Light tart fruit notes give a nice sweet and sour combo and here is even a more ""beer-like"" malty aftertaste and finish.
I actually like this a LOT, and that's in relation to my love of grapefruit juice but also because I find it very refreshing and tasty. Is it a classic? Perhaps not, but I like it and I don't care who knows. So there!"
Brooklyn Brewery,Brooklyn Buzz Bomb Ale,,,Braggot,8.00%,on-tap,3.68,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,10/11/2010,"On tap at Taco Mac Metropolis, Atlanta, GA, USA. Arrived at TM on a Sunday knowing that this beer had been tapped a few hours earlier. Asking my waitress if it was still on she said ""no"" and suggested the ""similar"", Brooklyn Pennant Ale! Good grief ::faceplam::. Anyway, I decided to investigate this myself by going to the bar - it was STILL pouring. Ho hum.
From notes.
A hazed, orange pour with a decent head and some lace. The lace is well formed and is nice and sticky.
Nose and tastes are rather wheat based which seems unusual for the style. Sweet elements from the beer which, given the style, I suppose is to be expected. The beer drinks very easily although the tastes are a little tiring (I couldn't see myself drinking much of this).
The beer has a slick mouthfeel which does make it easy to consume, but at the same time it makes it a beer that fills your palate and stomach quickly.
Interesting beer than seems like a sweet, wheat ale to me. Not quite as sweet as other Braggot's I've had but it is still a feature of this beer."
"Lakefront Brewery, Inc.",Fixed Gear,,,American Amber / Red Ale,6.50%,bottle,3.63,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,10/11/2010,"22 oz bottle, a recent arrival to the GA market. Pleasing presentation, too.
Pour is a very nice garnet color with the standard, requite white head that sits atop the beer. Good clarity and appropriate carbonation. To me, one of the most important things about the style is that it has some nice clarity, and this beer works well in that regard.
Nose is fairly neutral but the tastes are better. I'm always looking for a dry finish with the Reds and this beer delivers that. There is some sweeter fruit to temper the dry grains and the beer works nicely.
All in all a very solid effort and a beer that I could easily work with. Tasty and simple, the style highlights are hit nicely and the beer could be offered as a cross-over or introduction to a new style for a noob."
Sly Fox Brewing Company,Christmas Ale 2009,,,Winter Warmer,6.50%,bottle,3.78,4,4,3.5,4,4,10/11/2010,"Purchased form Sam the Beer Man in Binghamton, NY in summer of 2010.
750 mL bottle, $8.99, Corked & Caged.
Murky brown pour with a fair amount of yeasty sediment but a nice presentation in the glass. Good head forms, with a thick, mocha color and some nice lace. Looks good.
Pleasing nose with some gentle fruit and spice, but that doesn't really manifest itself quite as strongly in the tastes. Perhaps even the few months age on this has not treated it all that well, and it would have been better, fresher. Dubbel like fruit notes and some mild all-spice. Quite rich in the mouth - pleasing.
Certainly a beer that has probably not benefited all that much from a few months in the bottle, but still a beer hat i enjoyed and would re-visit."
"Bell's Brewery, Inc.",Bell's 25th Anniversary Ale,,,American Strong Ale,8.50%,bottle,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,10/10/2010,"12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Poured into the DFH signature glass, the beer pours a very attractive color (a copper/garnet body) but has a somewhat disappointing head with only a tiny amount of retention. A small film forms on the surface of the beer with a tiny, white collar. It lacks the richness and noisy pour of the best beers in the style.
Nose offers an aroma that I would characterize as a fruity, American DIPA effect. Some alcohol.
The tastes reflect the nose, BUT there is more fruit than hops, and also a certain acidity. Strange combination of tastes that alternates between working well in one mouthful and not combining quite so nicely in the next. Just when you think this is going to be a fruity, American strong ale, the hops quickly kick in with a large amount of dry character and make the beer quite bitter. Definitely some American Barleywine character but it never gets REALLY aggressive (as is often the case for the style). American Barleywine ""lite""??
To be fair, the beer DOES remind me of an Arrogant Bastard, but it's nowhere near as good, as drinkable or as smooth. It's too edgy (and not in a good way) and it lacks a refined, classy presence. A boozy, dry finish as well that delivers some warmth on the way down.
It IS tasty, but it's a beer that seems to ultimately fail to get its act together properly and leaves me hanging. just seems like it never got finished correctly."
Brasserie Cantillon,Cantillon Rosé De Gambrinus,,,Lambic - Fruit,5.00%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,10/10/2010,"375 mL bottle, corked & capped. Bottled 23rd December 2009.
Blood red, scarlet pour with a big fizzy, pink head on the pour. Obviously this fades quickly to leave no lace and there is almost no retention.
The nose makes it obvious that this going to be pretty tart. A little funk in the nose and we also get a touch of the horseblanket in the tastes.
Initial tastes (unsurprisingly) prove that. Some light fruit, but otherwise it is ALL dry, tart, apple notes with the usual cider elements being repeated for a man with West Country experience.
The sharp bitterness is frankly the only aspect that makes any sense here, as anticipated but as it warms we do get a touch of raspberry. Even at the higher temperatures the raspberry remains a restrained element but it manifests itself with a bit of a sherbet, candy note.
These beers ALWAYS take on a less aggressive element as they warm, and this is no exception. Carbonation in the mouth remains high and slightly prickly despite the lack of life in the body, in the glass.
Nothing that i didn't fully expect here, and in that respect the beer works well. Obviously you have to be in the mood for this kind of thing, but when you are nothing else will do."
Tyranena Brewing Company,Three Beaches Honey Blonde,,,American Blonde Ale,?,bottle,2.43,2,3,2.5,2,2,10/10/2010,"12 oz bottle, typical Tyranena presentation.
Bottom line is that this is not a very good beer.
The appearance is odd. It has a macro feel about it in as much as it comes with a huge number of small bubbles clinging to the inside of the glass. It looks highly carbonated, but the beer seems largely lifeless and there is no head or any retention. There is a darker color than a typical macro would give which I suppose is from the honey element.
The nose and taste do deliver a little sweetness from the honey, but they are minimal and all in all the beer is weak in taste, and dreadfully poor in terms of its presence. It lacks any depth at all, and feel watery and light without much taste at ALL.
Light and gassy, the beer lacks any depth that one would expect the honey to deliver.
One to give a very wide berth to, and surprisingly poor given the reputation of this brewer."
Amarcord Birra Artigianale (Spring Srl),E Figoun,,,German Pilsener,5.20%,bottle,2.1,2,2,2,3,2,10/9/2010,"$1.99 for the chance to try this at tower on Piedmont after this beer originally retailed around $5.99. An old(er) bottle, but with no discernible date on the label I feel totally justified in reviewing it.
Macro color on the pour except for a distinct haze - in that respect, a little like a Hefe in the glass. Poor head, not much retention.
Smell and tastes are slightly sweet, light vegetal aspects with nothing too offensive but at the same time nothing that would lead me to buy it again. Drinking is fairly easy, but one of these is more than enough.
As for style points - close to zero. It's a macro, Euro lager for all intents and purposes and I would NEVER have guessed German Pils in a 1000 years if tasting this blind.
I dunno, maybe fresher bottles would be better, but for now this is an abomination of a Pilsner and no more than a crappy Euro lager at best."
Amarcord Birra Artigianale (Spring Srl),La Mi Dòna,,,English Pale Ale,6.50%,bottle,3.38,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,10/9/2010,"$1.99 for the chance to try this at tower on Piedmont after this beer originally retailed around $5.99. An old(er) bottle, but with no discernible date on the label I feel totally justified in reviewing it.
Pour has a mid brown color that looks decent and promises a touch of richness. Head and retention are not great.
Nose and tastes are distinctly malty (as an English Pale often is), but it lacks much (if any) of the distinct, biscuit malts that the real thing would have. In that regard it's not at all authentic for the style, even if the beer does still manage to deliver a decent, malt-based experience.
Some caramel lightness which I like, and perhaps even a few notes of toffee.
Decent enough, probably much better fresh, and perhaps a beer that I would give another chance to."
Clipper City Brewing Co. / Heavy Seas Beer,Heavy Seas-The Greater Pumpkin,,,Pumpkin Ale,9.00%,bottle,3.33,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,10/7/2010,"I've been generally disappointed with the Heavy Seas, higher ABV (Mutiny) series. 22 oz bottle from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA. The usual Mutiny series presentation.
There is a turbid orange pour which disappoints. I really want a good clarity on any Pumpkin beer. Some low level head and a little bit of lace.
The nose replicates the combo of pumpkin and light liquor notes very well. I don't get excited about the aroma much, but it does it well. There is also a VERY strong, alcohol note that comes out of the glass which literally makes my eyes water.
The tastes also produce a very obvious barrel-aged note amongst the pumpkin, but it also combines to give a bit of a vegetal, carrot taste. The alcohol is also nowhere near what the aroma would suggest. Odd. There is lots of sweetness too, and the liquor notes are really quite subtle. Melds well.
The one good thing about this beer is that it does EXACTLY what it says on the label. This is often a problem with American brewed beer, but here it hits the pumpkin and barrel-aged notes pretty much on the nose - it doesn't *do* much for me, but it does a good job of replicating them.
For me, a funny beer. I don't like it much, but I can appreciate it and it grows on me a bit and at the end of the bottle I like it more than I did at the beginning. Having said that I would never buy this again."
Butternuts Beer And Ale,Moo Thunder Stout,,,Milk / Sweet Stout,4.90%,can,4,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,10/5/2010,"Delighted and impressed by another one of the offerings from Butternuts.
12 oz single can from Hop City, Atlanta, GA.
Pours a decent black color with a smallish head that fades quickly.
This is a simple milk stout that delivers a decent amount of acidity in the tastes. Light roast that is pretty delicate, competes with some sweet notes that play off one another nicely. Carbonation is low but perfect for the style, delivering a light beer that does NOT feel thin at all.
The light acidity is repeated in several areas and comes with a final flourish in the back end.
Smooth and very drinkable.
Very satisfying for such a simple beer, and in the beers' simplicity lies both its integrity and its most pleasing aspects."
Thornbridge Brewery,St Petersburg Imperial Stout,,,Russian Imperial Stout,7.70%,bottle,3.43,4,4,3.5,2.5,3,10/5/2010,"Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA. 500 mL bottle.
Jet black pour with standard appearance in terms of head and lace. Not a great deal to report but nevertheless, looks good.
Nose is quite rich and boozy and promises much.
Frankly, tastes are less impressive. There is a very distinct chalky nature to the beer which detracts from the richness in the mouth and also leads to a diminished taste profile. Elements of alcohol and light roasts are there, but the residue that coats the teeth and tongue subtract from the overall experience a bit.
It IS true that as the beer warms things get quite a bit better, both with heightened alcohol and some more warmth and depth of character. However, the beer still finishes with a dryish, precipitate feel - the solid suspension sits somewhere in the middle of it all. Light burn in the finish too.
This is not a clean beer at all, and although all of the requisite elements are there the mouthfeel and richness is not, and the chalky feel really gets in the way for me. Ultimately this does not do it for me."

500 mL bottle from Green's on Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Golden pour with a little haze. Head is above average and some attractive lace gets deposited on the Tucher Weizen glass 0.5 L glass.
Nose imparts a typical German yeast aroma and the tastes follow suit. Alcohol is well hidden and the beer gives a very pleasing combination of sweet malts and a light hop touch. typically German.
Very tasty with lots of German character and plenty of drinkability. The American versions of the style can be quite aggressive, but this is balanced, has manners and generally is more subtle (imagine THAT!)."
Lagunitas Brewing Company,A Little Sumpin' Wild,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,8.90%,bottle,4.03,4.5,4,4,4,4,10/3/2010,"22 oz bottle from Smyrna Beverage Center, Smyrna, GA, USA. $4.69.
Pour is a beautiful, tangerine orange body with tremendous clarity, good carbonation and a light and wispy head that offers some great lace.
The nose offers a LOT of west coast, medicinal, sinus clearing, grapefruit and citrus based hops.
I'm almost instantly annoyed by the beer as soon as it hits my taste buds. For all intents and purposes (in least in terms of its taste) this is an IPA. Not a problem, but in the BA database it is listed as a BSPA. There really isn't much else here other than a strong citrus based, IPA profile.
All of that is fine, but the Westmalle yeast is simply not present in the taste. The beer is NOT even a Belgian IPA! The hop presence (which is very tasty BTW, and is in the manner of a ""Fresh Hop"" style) overwhelms any possible Belgian notes (either in terms of yeast or candi sugar).
Syrupy, viscous feel which is appropriate for a beer of this ABV.
This IS a tasty beer; it DOES have a really nice look and hop presence, but if this is a ""Belgian"" beer of any description, I'm a Dutchman! If I were to rate this to any kind of Belgian style it would be really poor. Frankly, confused."
Amarcord Birra Artigianale (Spring Srl),La Puténa,,,Vienna Lager,6.50%,bottle,3.6,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,10/2/2010,"Swing-top bottle that I picked up for the bargain price of $1.99 at Tower on Piedmont, Atlanta, GA, USA (these bottles have been on sale in Atlanta in the $5.99 range prior to this).
These bottles have been in ATL for quite a while now, and obviously they are trying to move this stock that did not sell well. No freshness date on the bottle, but probably an old""er"" bottle.
Nice presentation in the swing top bottle which pops open with gusto, so a good sign there.
Pour is a light brown affair with a tan colored head that offers some retention (at least to the point where there is a light film on the surface of the beer and a ring around the extreme edge. Color is a slightly hazed, peachy brown.
Nose offers some fairly serious, rich malts and begins to raise the anticipation levels.
Tastes do not really match the potential of the nose, and the beer feels a little lackluster and somewhat musty. The beer is probably not exactly the freshest sample available, and it shows. Nevertheless, with no freshness date on the bottle, what can one do? Plenty of caramel.
Light malts with a touch of alcohol, the beer resembles a light version of a Doppelbock (if that makes ANY sense!). Clean finish amongst the malty undertones.
Interesting, and I would love to try this from a source that I knew was really fresh."
Sprecher Brewing Company,Pub Brown Ale,,,English Brown Ale,4.80%,bottle,4.2,4,4,4,4,5,10/2/2010,"16 oz stubbie as per usual from Sprecher - there's something really substantial about these bottles that I like. Apparently, now called, ""Pub Brown Ale"".
Pour gives a good dark brown color, and importantly a decent clarity with good carbonation. The head is well formed (and white) and the lacing is better than expected. Solid appearance.
The thing that i like about Sprecher more than anything else, is the fact that they generally make simple beers, to style in many of the somewhat unfashionable these days, styles. The Pub Brown is another example of that mentality and it is immensely enjoyable for those reasons.
A beer that forms a lovely, satisfying presence in the mouth with a full body and a malt sweetness that complement the light dry character that a kiss of hops bring. Very tasty, I would love to try this as a draught offering.
A really lovely beer that conjures up memories of happier times, sipping lower ABV beers in pubs on cold English days."
O'Dempsey's LLC,Inukshuk IPA,,,American IPA,7.00%,on-tap,2.73,1.5,3,3,3,2,10/1/2010,"16 oz pint at Taco Mac, East West Connector, Atlanta/Austell, GA, USA.
Strange one this.
The beer pours an unattractive, soup-like, nasty, brown, murky color like dirty water. A mediocre head and virtually no retention complete the ugliness of the delivery - really unattractive color, especially for something that calls itself an IPA.
The funny thing is, that the beer tastes a LOT better than the appearance would suggest, BUT it is an incredibly fruity, sweet IPA and NOT one that shows any signs of significant hop bitterness or any alcohol (I was amazed to see this listed at 7%).
There are some light pineapple and bubble-gum notes, but also some almond (marzipan) tastes too. It drinks a bit better than that description might suggest, but there's virtually no hop bitterness that I pick up.
Difficult to get past the soup that greets the eyes, and pretty much a terrible beer if you want a bitter, American IPA, but it tasted better than all of that sounds. having said that, this needs to go back to the drawing board before I would EVER considering buying it again."

Beautiful, dark amber pour with superb clarity, a nice head, decent retention and some good, persistent carbonation. Very good looking.
Nose and tastes give a very distinct Summit profile, which of course is a good thing! Classic combination of the style and the hop to give a really clean, dry and sharp finish that works very well together. Lovely, restrained malts pull the whole thing together really well. Yeasty back end that holds the beer solidly in the genre. Caramel notes finish the taste profile very nicely.
Really nice beer that represents the style and the ingredients very well - tasty, and a nice introduction to Autumn in the still ridiculously hot, Atlanta."
Red Brick Brewing Company,Fred Brick,,,California Common / Steam Beer,5.20%,on-tap,3.03,3.5,3,3,3,3,10/1/2010,"""Fred Brick"" brewed by Red Brick in association with Fred Crudder of ""The Fred"" fame, and Taco Mac's beverage manager. (Nothing like naming bars and beers after yourself!)



Anyway...



...16 oz pout at Taco Mac on the East West Connector, Austell, GA, USA.



Pour offers a nice clarity with a lighter than expected golden color. It certainly doesn't have much ""Red"" or ""Amber"" color. Head is about average and offers some lace. Looks OK.



Nose and tastes offer the usual Red Brick experience. Solid, OK, but pretty much forgettable. Simple hop profile and a gentle malt backbone hold the thing together. Seems to me like there is a familiarity about the yeast strain used which I don't dislike as such, but it seems to offer a certain blandness to most of Red Brick's beers. BTW - I'm NOT sure this is a fact, but it drinks that way to me.



Finish is clean, but it's presence is just so so for a beer that has been (apparently) brewed as a ""one-off"" and as a ""special"" release. 



Drinkable? Sure, I'd have one or two (well, maybe one), and ultimately disappointing and terribly uninteresting.



Not offensive, but a light caramel based beer with no distinguishing character as per usual from the ""rut"" that IS Red Brick Brewery. What I'd expect from Taco Mac, the beer destination for consumers that *think* they know beer but really just tick beers to collect T-shirts."
Brewery Ommegang,Ommegang Cup O Kyndnes (Cup Of Kindness),,,Scottish Ale,6.60%,bottle,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,9/30/2010,"I always get excited by the prospect of another Ommegang special release and this is no exception.
750 mL corked & caged bottle in the usual Ommegang presentation.
Beer opens with a slightly disappointing lack of pop, but the pour is better than the lack of gas might suggest. Although the color is that slightly clouded, not particularly attractive mid-brown, Dubbel like affair, it is pretty much as I expected. The head and lace are much better, and the creamy residue that sticks to the side of the glass is very pleasing and reminds me (in a good way) of a nitro pour.
The nose is chock-full of malty fruits. The aroma is reminiscent of a Belgian strong with some prunes, plums, raisins and other dark fruits.
Initial tastes reflect most of that, but add a traditional, lightly smoked, peat element that meshes really well. Some super alcohol notes (which is somewhat surprising considering the restrained ABV), and it also adds a light alcohol touch in the backend and finish/aftertaste. A touch of estery pineapple too.
Mouthfeel is resplendent with a creamy finish and a full feel.
The difference between this and Terrapin's version of the style that I had a couple of days ago is STARK, and not in a good way for the Terrapin guys. This is a benchmark in the style for me. Not my favorite style but a really great beer in the genre."
Guinness Ltd.,Guinness Foreign Extra Stout,,,Foreign / Export Stout,7.50%,bottle,4.08,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,9/26/2010,"12 oz single from Hop Cit, Atlanta, GA.
This beer was not available in the USA until relatively recently (last few months) when Atlanta became one of the test markets before a wider launch across the USA in September of 2010.
With all of the various incarnations of this beer being brewed in all parts of the world, I'm pretty sure this review is in the correct place since apparently (according to the bottle at least) this was brewed in Ireland and not the West Indies etc.
Pour as expected is jet black, but the head reminds me of the Guinness my dad used to drink with a really solid, rocky nature to it. Impressive.
This maybe a combination of mind games and tricks, but his version of the classic black stuff seems richer, deeper, darker and sweeter than many others. The mouthfeel seems particularly rich and I even get a splash of smoke in the back end. Some nutty elements too, with peanuts being part of the game.
I really enjoyed this single bottle, but I do question myself as to whether this is all a trick of the mind. Still, good stuff and very drinkable."
Hacker-Pschorr Bräu GmbH,Hacker-Pschorr Munich Gold,,,Munich Helles Lager,5.50%,bottle,4,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,9/26/2010,"Delighted to find this at Hop City as a 12 oz single. Not sure if I have seen this in the US before now, a welcome addition.
Classic golden clarity on the pour, with nice carbonation that produces a bone-white head. Some lace and a little retention.
Nose and tastes give plenty of malt based sweetness that manifests itself in a honey, grain and raisin manner. A little organic grass in there too and plenty of freshly mowed hay on the back end.
Crisp and thirst quenching, the beer delivers a positive taste with also the neutrality of a macro like sharp, quenching edge - best of both worlds. 
No reason to ever pick up a macro BMC beer if beers like this are around."
Smuttynose Brewing Company,Smuttynose Really Old Brown Dog Ale (Big Beer Series),,,Old Ale,10.00%,bottle,4.13,3.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,9/26/2010,"Pleased to see this beer make it to Hop City, Atlanta, GA.
22 oz bomber. Obviously I was thinking that this would be an Imperial Brown Ale, but apparently it is categorized as an Old Ale here.
Pour is a murky brow, Dubbel like color. Not especially attractive and I would love to have a beer that showed a really beautiful, reddish brown clarity. Head was fine, but it disappears quickly. It's a shame that beers with higher ABV's cannot produce better heads.
The nose gives up a LOT of chocolate. I was really expecting that, but it is pronounced and keeps coming. A little alcohol.
The tastes give up a massive amount of warming, liquor like alcohol quickly. Very mild chocolate malts come in behind the warming alcohol, but it never gets as big as the nose might have suggested.
Smooth and slick in the mouth that compliment the alcohol nicely.
Considering the ABV, this beer is very drinkable, but for me it's a cold, damp, fall or winter weather sipper. In that respect I'd like to hold on to one or two of these for some future evenings. A very tasty."
Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Duvel Tripel Hop,,,Belgian IPA,9.50%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,9/25/2010,"OK, not really sure what the purpose of this beer actually IS, as it seems as though Ommegang has had an influence on Moortgat. As much as I love Ommegang, this is not an influence or input that is needed under ANY circumstances when you consider the superb, supremecy of Duvel.
Extravagant presentation with thick, gold foil and corked & caged presentation with a fancy label. Close to @$20 for the chance to try this.
The pour is interesting since on the first two pours into the Duvel tulip there is little to choose between this and Duvel (nice golden clarity with a high, rocky, white head), but on the second two pours there is a lot more cloudy character.
Initial tastes do not detract much from simple Duvel either, but if anything the alcohol presence is slightly dulled as is the Belgian character of yeast, esters and light candy. Dulling those attributes serves no purpose and seems like a waste of time.
The extra hop character does build over the course of the beer, but it never really amounted to anything that supersedes (or ""betters"" Duvel) - in that respect I see no point. Some bitterness builds along with a dry character, and it's not unpleasant, but WHY? Increased grapefruit is DEFINITE, and increased grapefruit is something I generally enjoy, but...
...""WHY?"" remains the underlying question here. This beer doesn't stray THAT far from Duvel, but why bother at all? I don't get it and frankly ultimately I just crave a straight-up Duvel even more."
Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,Miles Davis' Bitches Brew,,,Russian Imperial Stout,9.00%,bottle,3.75,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,9/25/2010,"750 mL bottle.
The usual hoopla that is associated with DFH (relatively) limited releases that is beginning to leave me cold. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of DFH but the hysteria that has been building over a number of beers in the recent past is getting tedious. Ho hum.
Pour reports nothing. It's jet black and there is not much head. Perhaps a few red highlights but so what. Good but standard.
Not a particularly rich RIS, in fact rather average. Solid roast notes, a decent splash of alcohol and perhaps some spice from the odd ingredients, but ultimately sort of unmemorable. I would not go out of my way for this, and in the end it does not stand out.
Again, don't get me wrong this is a tasty, nice beer, but some of the hysterical yabbering about this beer has been a little ridiculous. By all means buy a bottle and enjoy it, but expect a standard, good RIS and leave it at that.
Ultimately, as my 11 year old would say, ""whateva""."
Redhook Ale Brewery,Treblehook,,,American Barleywine,10.10%,bottle,3.68,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,9/24/2010,"Very low expectations for this beer, as the history with Redhook and the aggressiveness of the style put me in a bad mood before I even open the beer. In the updated presentation for the Limited release Series from Redhook.
Actually, the style forced me into aging this for a year because I knew I would probably not enjoy the alcohol and hop intensity when it was young. This both is almost exactly 1 year old, and carries a date of SEP 09 2009.
Pour and nose are exactly as expecting, giving a mid-brown, low carbonated body with a lot of hop aggression and some alcohol. Head and lace are both minimal (again as expected for the style and ABV). All in all, not much to report initially, and pretty much to style - so far, so good.
Given that initially this beer fits the style well, I am assuming that over time these tastes have changed and mellowed a LOT. There is a fair amount of peach-like fruit character, a decent amount of sweetness and a hop profile that has probably dropped off a lot. Much more malty than I expected, and I suspect it is a lot smoother than it was a year ago.
Good decision to leave this for a year, and pleasantly surprised."
Terrapin Beer Company,Terrapin Reunion Beer 2010,,,Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy,8.50%,bottle,2.43,2.5,3.5,2,2,2.5,9/24/2010,"As per the SP series, a 22 oz bottle with gold foil.
A dark copper body with a really disappointing lack of head a lace. Almost seems ""flat"" and this seriously detracts from the whole experience in terms of appearance and mouthfeel.
Nose is a malty, alcohol infused aroma - fair enough, no complaints there.
Carbonation seems a little low to me. Lacks spark, depth and life.
Massive, and I mean massive, bubble-gum presence in the taste; OVERWHELMING in fact. There is almost nothing here other than the bubble-gum esters and a little warming alcohol. The funny thing is that I quite enjoy the bubble-gum character normally, AND it is somewhat appropriate for the style, BUT this beer is so over the top it's damaging. Too strong a presence by a mile.
The tastes make the beer difficult to drink and really lacking in grace - ho hum."

Beer does DEFINITELY not have the color of a Belgian Pale, and on the menu it was advertised a ""Strong Golden Ale"" which again, it most definitely isn't. Not sure what they are going for here. To me it has more of the character of a dark(er), Belgian ""single""/""simple"" with perhaps a hint of Belgian IPA character in there too (American influence - unwelcome in my book).
The pour is amber with a fair amount of chill-haze. Light, but appropriate carbonation and a relatively smooth mouthfeel.
The nose and tastes combine to get an interesting sweet-sour note of light pineapple and then in the back end some more pineapple. Nice touches of Belgian yeast and some alcohol. All in all quite enjoyable.
The only problem I have is with the color. If this truly were a golden color, or indeed a Belgian PALE, then I would be happier."
Southern Tier Brewing Company,2XIPA,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,8.20%,bottle,3.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,9/23/2010,"12 oz single, Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Hazed, orange pour with a bone-white head. Not much lace. Unusually light in color for a DIPA with almost a Hefe (or a least a wheat beer) look about it.
Nose has sweet, sugary citrus which is replicated in the taste. Not especially bitter, and frankly a pretty reserved and low hop presence in this beer for the style. This is NOT a complex or complicated beer by any stretch of the imagination, and for me that's the appeal. Simple, tasty stuff.
Pretty drinkable, but there's no way that one could describe the tastes as typical for an American DIPA where the hop presence is supposed to be high. Definitely NOT a ""West Coast"" version of the style, which I suppose, makes perfect sense. Short finish without lingering bitterness. Alcohol very well hidden considering.
Not a classic example of the style, and I would imagine that this will disappoint many people that are looking for some palate wrenching bitterness. For me though, it works well and I enjoyed the simplicity of the beer despite the high ABV."
"Pyramid Breweries, Inc.",Audacious Apricot Ale,,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,5.10%,bottle,1.45,1.5,2,1.5,1,1,9/22/2010,"Thanks to Kevin for the 12 oz stubbie bottle.
In a nutshell, one of the nastiest beers in recent memory.
The pour is a surprisingly dark orange, almost marmalade color with a HORRIBLE fizzing associated with it. Pours like a soda with no head or lace of any description. The beer also looks murky. The soda-like nature of the carbonation is worrying.
Unpleasant non-descript, artifical fruit taste greet the nose and mouth and imparts a sickly, sugar attack on the senses that defies any real, specific explanation or description. It's definitely like some kind of generic fruit ""punch"".
Drain pour."
Hoppin' Frog Brewery,Frog's Hollow Double Pumpkin Ale,,,Pumpkin Ale,8.40%,bottle,3.83,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,9/19/2010,"$9.99 from Arbor Place Beverage, Douglasville, GA, USA.
22 oz bottle, the usual Hoppin' Frog presentation.
Pour has an attractive, deep orange color with good clarity, but a smallish and poorly retained head.
Nice combination of spices in the nose and the taste. The dominant flavor is a warmish, ginger. The ginger actually burns a little and is quite strong, with a little heat. The beer is plenty simple and reflects what one would expect from the style, but the ginger heat is definitely the feature that lingers, even giving a light burn in the chest on the way down.
A little alcohol warmth and even more ginger. The ginger mimics the alcohol warmth.
The beer is a little light in the body, but all in all I did enjoy it. You've really got to like the niche of pumpkin because without that you are going to find this difficult to cope with, but no more than any other in the style."
Spoetzl Brewery,Shiner Oktoberfest,,,Märzen / Oktoberfest,5.80%,bottle,2.15,3,1.5,2,3,2.5,9/19/2010,"12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Amber pour, with little head or retention. Head fades badly.
Aroma is bereft of any necessary elements. Horribly disappointing.
Light malt tastes, but weak when considering the O'fest category as a whole. Malts are supported by a little hop factor, but it's ultimately somewhat non-descript. Fairly well balanced if rather bland, sand the downfall of the beer is really its lack of malt presence.
Very little to report with this beer, a malt based beer that lacks any kind of depth or presence. As expected.
Scores (probably hundred's) of deeper beers in this style to try before this one."

My bottle is the ""Framboise"" that I'm pretty sure is the US version of ""Rose"".
To be honest, I'm NOT against this kind of beer as a matter of principle, but having tasted this beer it's not something that I can take.
Peach colored pour with a nice head that produces some lace. Th beer actually looks OK, as long as you observe it for what it is and no more. 
The nose is that bad either, with some artificial raspberry notes and some lightly acidic lemon. Things go awry when the tastes cut in. The nasty, fake sweetener taste that cuts across the whole drink is where the beer fails. It leaves that nasty, dry aftertaste. The fruit is there, and to be honest it's not too sweet or actually unpleasant but it seems fake. A little more lemony acidity and we're done here.
Not good, but to be honest I never thought it would be."

One of the three new LTM beers to reach Georgia relatively recently and I felt the Doppelbock would be the best place for me to start.
Pop on opening is not great that concerns me slightly but ultimately there was no need to worry.
The pour is a very deep, chocolate brown with a lovely, mocha head and a little lace. The depth of color is impressive.
The nose is even more impressive. An incredibly deep, malt bomb with lots of alcohol and plenty of chocolate notes. The nose and tastes also reflect more than a touch of whiskey too, but it's still classic Doppelbock. Plenty of alcohol comes through, but it seems appropriate and in sync with the style so nothing to concern you there. 
The mouthfeel is without exception, the weakness of this beer. Under no circumstances is it poor or watery, but it does not reflect the depth of color or the depth that we find in the nose. In that respect it is a slight disappointment.
Very boozy, but to be honest it seems appropriate. Not an easy beer to handle, but again, it works well for the style.
Lovely beer that represents the style nicely. Big presence, as it should have."
Brouwerij Smisje,t Smisje Grande Reserva,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,11.00%,bottle,4.93,3.5,5,5,5,5,9/17/2010,"11.2 oz ""stubbie"" bottle from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
WOW! This happens about every 6-12 months, i.e. a beer that truly blows me away.
A truly magnificent, regal beer.
The pour and the appearance are most definitely the weakest points. A light brown, murky affair with an annoy over-carbonation that leads to a difficult pour and foam that snakes out of the bottle.
After the somewhat disappointing appearance things REALLY take-off in a serious manner.
The nose and tastes yield a pretty much perfect combination of light liquor and beautiful depth of raisin based fruit, alongside a lovely, candied Belgian presence, with gentle warming alcohol. This beer has alcohol hidden beyond belief but still delivers a caressing, seductive warmth in the chest on the way down. Layer after layer of malt goodness break on the tongue with light peat and repetitive smoothness. the beer repeats it's gentle kiss over and over again that creates a lingering, loving ending and an aftertaste that is difficult to remove. Class.
I'm simply not a huge fan of barrel-aged beers but this an exception brew that takes me to a place that i was not expecting. Stunning."
Left Hand Brewing Company,Midnight Project #3 Oxymoron,,,American Double / Imperial Pilsner,7.20%,bottle,3,3.5,4,2.5,3,3,9/16/2010,"22 oz bottle.
Well, this certainly lives up to the name, a strange beer to say the least.
I don't quite know how to describe this, but it drinks like a dry, hoppy Marzen. It's odd because the last thing that you would associate with a lager of that basic description would be a dry character or a bitterness - odd.
Perfectly clear, the beer pours with a disappointingly scant head, not much lace and golden orange hue.
The nose is really rich and nice. It offers some classic sweet notes and some pretty malty notes - like a classic, German lager should. The tastes however cut in with a profound bitterness that is very dry. The hoppy notes seem really aggressive and the lingering dry tastes attack again in the aftertaste. Dry, dry, dry!
Odd, since the taste as described above does not suggest much drinkability, and indeed I would not want a lot of this, but the beer is not horrible.
I don't get this at all."

16 oz pint, on tap at Taco Mac, Woodstock, GA, USA.
Golden pour that produces some nice lace despite the head fading fairly fast. Carbonation is medium.
Nose delivers an unusual combination of a decent Pils-like bite of hops, but also a sweet background to the beer. The sweetness is the thing that stays with me which would normally make me a little unhappy, but the fact that there IS a decent dose of hop bitterness too, helps me to enjoy this beer a little more than I thought I might. Then sweetness comes with a touch of fruit, a bit like some peach infused soda.
Smooth in the mouth, the carbonation seems just right.
A simple beer that doesn't really encapsulate a typical German Pils, but it is drinkable and an excellent offering to open up some eyes for crossover potential."
Victory Brewing Company,Saison Du BUFF,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,6.80%,bottle,1.75,4,3,1,3,1,9/12/2010,"12 oz bottle from Hop City, Atlanta, GA. $2.99 I *think*.
Nice looking pour with a very attractive golden color and plenty of head. Some retention, a little lace. Solid looking.
The aroma gives a little white pepper and a few sinus clearing elements, but nothing out of the ordinary for a Saison. HOWEVER, this does not set me up for the taste!
The taste is a garlic laden, herbal assault that is difficult to get to grips with. It's abusive up front, but fades a bit as the beer warms. Nevertheless there is very little subtlety here. Perhaps this is the point of the beer I dunno, but it still makes it hard work.
Green elements, almost reminiscent of chewing on some floral hops are followed by a bitter, unrelenting, aggressive finish and aftertaste.The beer constantly recalls accidentally chewing on a cardamon seed in a great curry, or perhaps getting a mouthful of rosemary that was not properly integrated into a great lamb dish.
Extreme, and not not necessarily in a really good way. Barely even beer in the truest sense of the word.
I think this is a classic example of American brewing going awry. Stupid beer, flawed concept, difficult to drink, no point."
Brouwerij Roman N.V.,Adriaen Brouwer Dark Gold Ale,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,8.50%,bottle,4.2,4,4,4,5,4.5,9/11/2010,"750 mL corked & caged bottle from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Beer pours with a brown, Dubbel like color but with more clarity than one associates with the Dubbel category.
The bottle opens with a disappointing lack of pop, but pours in a very much better manner than the opening would suggest. the beer yields a lovely, creamy, cream colored film on the surface of the beer, and produces a small amount of broken lace. Nice, light booze in the nose that produces some decent sherry aromas.
There's a decent amount of yeast in the nose and this get carried forward to the taste. Some fruit, a little alcohol but the beer also produces a mouthfeel that is reminiscent of a nitro pour - strange.
Plenty of sweetness and a nice balance from a really malty background. A little boozy, but it comes in with some sherry notes and a touch of almond marzipan.
Definitely an odd beer. In summary I would say that this is a cross between a Dubbel and a BSDA, with a few alcohol notes and with a strange (but good), nitro-pour character.
Crazy, but drinkable and good beer."
Brouwerij De Molen,Heaven & Hell,,,American Double / Imperial Stout,10.20%,bottle,3.25,4,3.5,3,3,3.5,9/10/2010,"12 oz bottle with red wax on the neck. Brewed 23/11/09 and bottled on 08/01/10 - already 9 months old. Bottle # 1159.
$8.99 from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA. 
The beer pours as one would expect. Jet black body with a tan head that produces a little lace and some alcohol legs.
The beers' overwhelming aspect is a deliberate and sapping dryness. It's not the alcohol that you remember (it's well hidden), nor is it the considerable bitterness (which is persistent) and it's not even the roasty, burned and slight charcoal notes (as they should be present), but rather it's a chalky mid and back ending that will not go away. ""Chalk"" is really the dominant adjective for me.
Outside of that unfortunate taste, the beer does deliver all of the requisite aspects for the style, but they don't overcome the feeling that an indigestion tablet has been dissolved in the bottle before opening. It colors everything."
New Glarus Brewing Company,Stone Soup,,,Belgian Pale Ale,5.30%,bottle,3.45,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,9/9/2010,"12 oz single, thanks go out to Kevin for the opportunity.
Pour is a bright, honey orange affair with a large, but somewhat light and thinnish head. The head is not especially well retained and there is little lace, both of which seem to be a function of the high carbonation of the beer.
At times the beer almost seems ""fizzy"" and this obviously detracts from the mouthfeel. 
The aroma and tastes definitely have a nice Belgian yeast character, but ultimately that's all it is - a ""character"" rather than a fully blown presence. The beer needs an entirely larger and brisker presence to challenge the better beers of the style. Some dry pineapple does cut in, but the estery fruit notes seem to fade just one wants them to cut in with a vengeance.
A little more fruit in the finish but it also dies a slow death in the mouth.
It just feels as though the beer needs an injection of flavor to get it over the hump. God forbid, but it almost feels like it's a ""Lite"" Belgian Pale@ Gulp..."
Cigar City Brewing,110K+OT Batch #3 - The Other West Coast IPA (2010),,,American Double / Imperial IPA,10.00%,bottle,2.98,3.5,3,3,3.5,2.5,9/4/2010,"Purchased as a 750 mL at Big Z beverages in New York. Delighted to find this at the time, but also seems silly that paperwork (apparently) has prevented us from getting this in GA. 
Shared this one at The Brick Store recently.
Hazy, orange amber pour with some nice, sticky lace.
Nose and tastes are essentially a malt bomb which may confuse those people looking for a West Coast style DIPA. I have no problem with a DIPA taking on some significant malt character, but in this case the beer seems overwhelmed by a bready sweetness that is unrelenting. I suppose it's all in order, but it actually makes the beer have a very low drinkability IMO - surprising coming from me, since I usually enjoy that aspect of many beers.
Very little hop character and a LOT of Barleywine-like features, but strangely without the typical hop aggression of the American BW, or the sherry-like notes of the English original.
My first CCB beer, and to be honest, given all the hoopla surrounding this brewery I'm not greatly impressed. Having said that, the amount of hype that accompanies certain, new breweries and their beers these days, how could the hype be justified? Impossible.
Strange beer that I don't think much of."

Always delighted to get a new beer from a favorite brewery and this beer seems to be right in the wheelhouse of De Ranke.
A cloudy, honey orange body with a lovely, fluffy head which produces some super lace. Looks nice.
Nose has a light, soapy aroma which some small hop character.
The tastes largely reflect the nose, but the hoppy notes, soapy taste and light grapefruit are all exaggerated when compared to the aroma. Lovely light bitterness in the finish with a gentle sweet and sour final blast. Smooth and full in the mouth. Funk is not a big feature but it is there in the background, almost more like a sweetened, Belgian IPA. A gentle presence and a gentle beer.
Quite a delicate beer with some gentler hop presence than some other De Ranke offerings. A little more subtle, a little more sweetness and some added grapefruit-like fruit. In that respect, a De Ranke beer for beginners. Very tasty and moreish, a definite hit for me."
Clipper City Brewing Co. / Heavy Seas Beer,Heavy Seas - Märzen,,,Märzen / Oktoberfest,5.80%,bottle,3.38,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,9/3/2010,"12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Having been fairly disappointed with the Mutiny, 22 oz series from CC/Heavy Seas, I was pleased to see a ""back to basics"" beer from the stable, and also in one of my favorite styles.
Pour is a fairly light orange, amber beer with some scant head and lace.
The beer has a medium carbonation that produces a decent mouthfeel.
The beer does provide the typical element for the style- plenty of malt, yeasty aftertaste and a moreish and yummy taste, however the whole beer seems to drink WAY above the 5.4%. The alcohol is rather aggressive and the fusel ethanol is really odd considering the advertised ABV. The alcohol also manifests itself in the aftertaste as well. Odd.
It's all there, but so is a chronic alcohol taste which detracts from the experience."
Terrapin Beer Company,Terrapin Hopzilla,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,10.80%,bottle,3.9,4,4,4,4,3.5,8/30/2010,"#12 in the Side Project series.
Drunk twice; once on-tap at Leon's, Decatur, GA, USA on the night of the Terrapin takeover, and once from the bottle. This review is from the bottle version purchased at Green's, Buford Highway, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Usual 22 oz presentation with the gold foil.
Pour is a hazed, light orange affair with a big head that produces some excellent lace. Retention is OK. Looks nice.
Nose and tastes replicate a west Coast style DIPA quite nicely with huge grapefruit, pine and alcohol notes combining to produce a beer that represents the style VERY well. I need to be in the mood for this type of beer, but if I were, this would fit the bill nicely. With deliberate and obviously big alcohol, a syrupy mouthfeel and an aggressive blend of malt and hops, this beer is not trying to be anything other than an abusing assault on the palate. However, like great DIPA's of this ilk, it still manages to remain within the parameters of the style (whatever they may be) and has just about enough of each element to hold the whole package together.
I seldom want a beer like this, but if and when I do, this would be a good one to turn to.
Drinkability is what it is, i.e. not great, but to be honest you are not going to want to drink a lot anyway.
In short, it does what it says on the can (bottle)."
Abita Brewing Co.,S.O.S. (Save Our Shore),,,German Pilsener,7.00%,bottle,2.88,3,2.5,2.5,4,3.5,8/28/2010,"22 oz screen printed bottle. Abita's charitable effort.
Best By 08/11 on the neck of the bottle - can a Pils with an ABV of 7.00% really feel fresh over one year from now? I dunno - maybe.
Pour offers a light, straw colored body with a fairly low level of carbonation. The head is minimal, but at least it hangs around to leave a small film on the surface of the beer and a decent amount of broken lace.
Smell is a neutral sweet one with nothing else to report.
Tastes are inoffensive but frankly they lack any kind of Saaz bite or bitterness. The beer comes through with some creamy, neutrality but in the end it is somewhat weak. A lack of crispness and a lack of dark, bitterness that I expect from the style.
The bottle calls this a ""Weizen Pils"" which I'm not sure means, but there is a light haze in the body. The bottle also boasts that there is sweet malt (true) and bitterness (not true).
Ultimately this beer is rather uninteresting and lacks most of the redeeming qualities of a serious Pils - never mind."
Guinness Ltd.,Smithwick's,,,Irish Red Ale,4.50%,bottle,3.55,4.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,8/28/2010,"12 oz bottle as part of a six pack.
Body is a rather impressive brown/red with an excellent creamy head and some superb lace. Surprisingly good.
Nose yields a big malty presence plus a touch of hops - not much, rather a ""kiss"".
The tastes are somewhat uninteresting an neutral, but the back end has a touch of bitterness. The bitterness is fleeting but surprisingly strong. 
Quite a dry beer (despite the malt emphasis), and this is manifested in the finish which drops quite a profound bitterness on the tongue - odd! Strange beer that looks great and then comes back with some quite severe bitterness."
De Struise Brouwers,Pannepot Reserva - Old Fisherman's Ale,,,Quadrupel (Quad),10.00%,bottle,4.18,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,8/27/2010,"11.2 oz bottle from Charleston Beer Exchange, Charleston, SC, USA. $7.99. 2008 vintage.
Pour is a Dubbel-like affair that is a murky brown but also has a slight plum-colored, ""grapeish"", light purple hue - possibly just the light.
Thin film sits atop the beer and a ring forms around the edge of the surface. No lace. A few alcohol legs.
Even with a decent amount of warming, as the beer comes to ambient temperature the nose is largely muted - surprising.
Tastes are largely as expected with a tea-like base, followed by musty, light spice and plenty of sherry and dryish character. Plenty of brown sugar, too.
There is a touch of warmth in the finish and aftertaste, but it's pretty mild and the alcohol is generally well-hidden for a 10% beer. 
The oaking has produced a mellow beer that does not taste ""woody"" or barrel-aged to any extent, and in that respect I really like it. Not aggressive and certainly not typically oaked. Very drinkable, and for such a beer it drinks easily and without fuss. Surprisingly ""normal""."
Ithaca Beer Company,Ground Break,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,6.00%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,8/27/2010,"12 oz single from the brewery.
Slightly murky golden color with an impressive head that lingers. Some lace.
The nose and tastes are VERY organic and quite aggressive. Lots of serious grass and hay and a lot of bitterness. Some medicinal phenols to that come thorough in bursts, repeating the grass and organic feel.
Lots of rustic notes her that build in places to give quite a bitter beer. In other parts the beer drinks with a little more subtlety, but to be honest the beer is generally quite assertive.
Not a Saison that shows much restraint, but it does feel authentic and ""rural""."
Sprecher Brewing Company,IPA2 (Double India Pale Ale),,,American Double / Imperial IPA,8.40%,bottle,4.23,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,8/26/2010,"16 oz bottle presentation, the usual Sprecher, bulky ""stubbies"" which I really enjoy.
As soon as I tasted this beer I knew that if I read a few reviews at the lower end the criticisms would be that ""this doesn't really taste like an American DIPA"", and to be fair those reviewers are correct - that why I LIKE this beer! If you were to review this beer in a stylistic manner it would score very badly, but to me it drinks really well and is fantastically tasty, however if you are looking for a typical, American DIPA you are going to be severely disappointed.
Pour is a very nice mid-orange with some decent head, retention and lace.
The nose yields some alcohol and a little malty sweetness, but not really any hop note.
The tastes are very similar to the aroma and frankly the hops are pretty much conspicuous by their absence. This is a well put together, malty pale ale that has a slightly bitter and warm finish that rounds out nicely. Frankly, and rather confusingly, this is basically a beer that drinks like a malt-bomb rather than a hop bomb. Finishes with some warmth and a slightly liquor like back-end. Some sweetness and sherry round out the beer.
Very moreish for me, and a tasty beer that showcases the maltier side of things very well. Smooth in the mouth, it coats and is well balanced.
A catastrophic failure as an American DIPA, but a very pleasant to drink beer IMO. Reminds me more of a lighter Scotch Ale or a malt infused, ""double""pale ale in the English style. tasty."
Tröegs Brewing Company,Dream Weaver Wheat,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,4.80%,bottle,3.45,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,8/26/2010,"12 oz single from Kevin - many thanks. Different label than the one currently in the BA db picture.
Good looking, hazed butterscotch pour with good depth of color but a wispy, ill-retained head and virtually no lace.
Plenty of banana in the nose and tastes. The finish offers a little spice and bitterness that seems like orange peel. Lingers a touch as the beer establishes its aftertaste but the spice is not as big a feature as the fruity banana.
A bit prickly in the mouth as well which doesn't help the mouthfeel. In an odd way, the depth of color would suggest a smoother beer.
I like it, even if it is not all that thrilling, it seems to represent a decent example of the style."
Green's Gluten Free Beers,Green's Endeavour,,,Dubbel,7.00%,bottle,3.18,3.5,4,3,2.5,3,8/25/2010,"Older bottle (Best before 16/09/09). Interesting (again) in the non-beer/beer category.
Pour is a lively, fairly well carbonated affair that yields a Dubbel-like, murky brown body and a little, thin foam that hangs around. It even produces a small amount of lace - no mean feat.
Nose is VERY good with a strong sherry like, alcohol smell that is very enticing and promises much.
The beer delivers some of the characteristics that the nose does, but they are somewhat muted. Some light fruit, alcohol and more sherry plus rum, but not as intense as the nose would have suggested that they might be. Some oxidation, but that was to be expected with the slightly older nature of this beer.
Carbonation is where the beer falls down, with a thinnish body being rudely interrupted by a a fizzy, out of place , prickly carbonation. A little annoying.
The beer gets a little watery as it drinks too.
Well, considering the gluten free aspect this is not bad, however the body is where it falls down. I would drink this again, but not as good as St. Peter's Sorghum that I would buy again."

12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Mid-orange, macro like pour with good levels of carbonation and a rocky, if somewhat small head that produces some lace.
Nose and tastes are both lightly hopped with some of that characteristic soap note that can flag a beer with some bitter character. Dry body and a touch more bitterness make up the back end and finish. Definitely some grassy, hay like notes which is typical of many organic beers.
I was surprised by the hop-forward nature of this beer. No, it's not ""hoppy"" per se, but it does deliver a larger amount of bitterness compared to expectations."
Kiuchi Brewery,Hitachino Nipponia,,,Belgian Pale Ale,6.50%,bottle,3.13,3,4,2.5,3.5,3.5,8/24/2010,"550 mL bottle from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Not sure what to expect here, but what I do know is that it is brewed with the Sorachi Ace hop and the ""Ancient"" Kaneko Barley. Having not especially enjoyed Brooklyn's Sorachi rendition, I get a bit nervous about this beer.
Pour is a slightly hazed, golden body with limited head, retention and lace.
Nose and tastes give an awkward combo for me. There is a yeasty, light funk in the nose which promises much. It appears from the aroma that the beer is going to drink in a classic, Saison type manner with a light acidity and touches of traditional horseblanket and musty notes. All of these have great potential for me, however, when the beer reaches the palate it forces an IPA like bitterness on to the palate that just sits really awkwardly. There is a touch of lemongrass and honey in there too (good), and some other brief citrus notes, but then we get a blast of sweetened grapefruit and the beer falls between two stools as it aggressive seeks your attention. Sweet background complicates the issue for me.
Since my experience with Brooklyn's Sorachi Ace was almost identical (in terms of the odd, competing tastes), I feel that this is a feature of the hop and it's not something that I care for me. It's like the beer is trying to be a hoppy Saison, and it cuts right across both styles and does not deliver well on either front. More sickly sweetness too.
An odd beer for me, and not something that I'll be going back to anytime soon."
Sprecher Brewing Company,Black Bavarian,,,Schwarzbier,6.00%,bottle,3.85,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,8/22/2010,"Thanks go out to Kevin (again). 16 oz bottle in the usual Sprecher presentation.
The beer pours a solid black pour with a nice, creamy head and some superb red highlights. The lacing is not great. Still looks good though.
The nose changes with temperature (as expected) and there is a really large increase in the malt profile with temperature. The light licorice really builds a LOT with temperature.
The tastes give a lovely, sweet, light licorice touch that really develops IN the mouth. The light licorice bitterness is really the main feature of this beer. Sprecher develops some nice German brews and this is no exception. A decent rendition of the style and a beer that hits all the spots that one would expect.
Solid and tidy, the beer does pretty much what it advertises."

Typical Dubbel color with a burned orange appearance with a better than average head. Some creamy remnants form on the sides of the glass and on the surface of the beer.
The beer exhibits quite a lot of fruit in the nose and the taste with an emphasis on alcoholic, dry pineapples or peaches. Some marzipan notes as well. The combination of obvious malts and slightly more subtle yeasts drive this beer to a good place and it's nicely put together. In sheer terms of being ""well-brewed"", this is one on Terrapin's best efforts.
Finish is short.
I like the beer, mainly because it is so clean. Dubbels are a difficult thing for me as they have the potential to become somewhat ""muddy"" and lose definition. This one holds up well and has the potential to become a more frequent visitor to the Terrapin stable."
Ithaca Beer Company,Cascazilla,,,American Amber / Red Ale,7.00%,bottle,4.35,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,8/21/2010,"Had this a few times, including last month at the Brewery, but this review is from a 12 oz bottle that I bought at the Brewery about a month ago.
Pour is fantastic; a rocky head that produces great lace with plenty of retention.
The color of the body is perhaps one of the best! Reminds me of a classic ESB from England, even though the beer is a LONG way away from such a brew!
A classic example of the American Red style with potent hops, but bitterness that is tempered by a dry, rich malty backbone. Perfectly balanced, this is one aggressive beer, but, at least for the style, the ABV and other characteristics stay perfectly in balanced.
A really quintessential beer in the style and it comes without pretension.
I like this beer a LOT, it pushes the taste buds but keeps everything well within sensible parameters. No mean feat with this type of beer. Well done."
New Glarus Brewing Company,Crack'd Wheat,,,Hefeweizen,6.00%,bottle,3.55,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,8/21/2010,"12 oz single, courtesy of Kevin - many thanks.
Absolutely delighted to get a chance to try this beer. It promises much.
The pour is a lovely, butterscotch hazed affair with a nice, rocky head. Good looking beer without doubt.
The nose and tastes have plenty of clove and banana notes, but the emphasis seems to be on the clove and spice elements. Some alcohol, but also a few medicinal phenols. The phenols are where this beer starts to deviate a little from authenticity. They don't grate, but the y do add a pepper note which although is not too unpleasant, does take it a little out of the genre.
The finish comes through with a little more fusel alcohol.
Pretty nice beer with some good tastes but it does feel slightly out of the ordinary. You can make your own mind up as to whether this is a good thing or not."
New Belgium Brewing,Lips Of Faith Belgo IPA,,,Belgian IPA,8.00%,bottle,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,8/20/2010,"22 oz bottle in the usual Lips of Faith series presentation.
Beer pours out a pretty dark, copper color with a medium head. The lace is surprisingly good and forms a nice pattern. This is one of the better parts of the beer.
Nose is largely American IPA without much Belgian influence. The tastes do better, with a healthy dose of Belgian candy sugar and some yeast notes. Some metallic notes appear in the back end with a little coinage. The beer seems very dry to me, and the combination offers a bit of a battle of the senses which keep the beer interesting. There is some fruit, but it has a yeasty, fruit note like the slightly aging skins of black grapes. A bit of a musty note that's not funk, but is a little moldy.
Another interesting beer in the Lips of Faith series which keeps me interested. New Belgium has produced beers in the series that have varied between really good and really interesting and this one does not disappoint."
Full Sail Brewery & Tasting Room & Pub,Spotless IPA (Brewmaster Reserve 2010),,,American IPA,6.50%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,8/19/2010,"22 oz bottle from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Always interested to try a new Full Sail brew because I think that they brew some really good quality, simple beers.
The nose offers a bright citrus and a touch of alcohol.
The pour is a very slightly hazed, pale orange with a frothy head with mid level density. Some lace.
The tastes are very fruity upfront. Some nice, sweetish orange and other citrus notes at the front end which turn into more bitter citrus notes (grapefruit) on the back end with little metal as well. The sweet and then bitter combo works very well and offers what I would call an internal contrast. The beer is VERY refreshing and feels clean and tidy to me, which, is often a trait with Full Sail.
The bitter, brightness comes through in the aftertaste, too.
Nice beer, good value and something I would recommend to those seeking a clean beer that offers a fruity bitterness. Well balanced and clean."
Anchor Brewing Company,Anchor Humming Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),5.90%,bottle,3.45,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,8/16/2010,"Usual Anchor presentation. Bottle says 5.9% alcohol. Dot-matrixed freshness says OLU.
Always interested by a new Anchor brew, so here we go.
Bottle produces a beer that looks a little macro in its appearance except for a much better head that is solid and is retained well.
Neutral nose and some simple, balanced malt and hops make up this easily drinkable and simple brew.
In true Anchor style, this beer sits in the well-made category without setting the world on fire. A light fruit note is there, but it's pretty restrained.
All in all a beer that hits all the right notes and is in keeping with what one would expect."
Shipyard Brewing Co.,Shipyard Smashed Pumpkin (Pugsley's Signature Series),,,Pumpkin Ale,9.00%,bottle,4.35,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,8/15/2010,"22 oz bottle, classy presentation with high quality on the paper label that wraps around virtually the whole bottle. Gold foil on the neck.
Pumpkin Ales are not my favorite, so I feel a little wary, but this turned out to be a magnificent beer.
Pour gives me exactly what i was looking for in terms of color and clarity. A perfectly clear, copper/orange body with a decent head that is a little short lived. Given the ABV I can deal with that, so all in all a great looker.
A very light touch of spice and pumpkin on the nose, but a bigger burst of pumpkin in the taste. With it comes a big blast of alcohol but it seems all in proportion.
This is a great beer, with a beautiful balance of spice, alcohol, pumpkin and malt that comes together in a superbly tasty beer. LOTS of character and VERY drinkable.
Astonishing that this beer was made by the same people that made Pumpkinhead!"
Green Flash Brewing Co.,Bière De L'Amitié (Green Flash & Brasserie St. Feuillien),,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,9.50%,bottle,4.63,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,8/14/2010,"750 mL, corked and ""banded"".
An interesting collaboration, and on top of that an unlikely one. Green Flash are not exactly a subtle brewer (their existence in San Diego is unlikely to produce much of that), so I was concerned about their influence on a beer that would NOT benefit from a typical West Coast battering.
The beer is very highly carbonated to the point of being a little annoying. The corked pops with alarming ferocity and the beer pours all the way to the bottom of the bottle with a HUGE, semi-dense head. The one advantage is that it produces some of the greatest head retention and lace I have ever seen in a beer. The body is a perfect, light orange, honey hazed color which looks tremendous.
A big phenol nose is present, but to be honest it is well within parameters and sits well with me. It is tempered by fruit notes and some alcohol. Good.
This is a CLEAN beer, with very well defined edges and a fantastically hidden ABV. Some pineapple, lots of white pepper and very subtle, light spice. The finish is dry, bitter and warming with some alcohol, but before that point it remains restrained. A touch metallic, but nice.
Great beer. It is SO gentle it's scary. Beautiful."
Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,Sierra Nevada Tumbler Autumn Brown Ale,,,American Brown Ale,5.50%,on-tap,4,4,4,4,4,4,8/14/2010,"On tap @ Taco Mac in Peachtree City, GA, USA.
Absolutely delighted by the concept of a SN beer that *should* reduce the hop profile to a lesser role, let's see if the beer manages to apply that theory to practice.
Nothing to complain about in the pour. A decent dark brown color (personally I'd like to see a little more red in the body but that's really a personal preference) with a nice, rocky, full head that lingers and produces some super lace. Good looking beer.
Nose and tastes do well to uphold the malt aspect of the Brown Ale. Whenever I see the style ""American"" Brown Ale I slightly cringe, since what that usually translates into is a Brown Ale that is over-hopped. To me, Brown Ales are one style that simply suffers when we start to add extravagant hop profiles, and given SN's ""house style"" this had warnings ALL over it for me. Personally I think there IS a little too much hop profile in the beer, BUT by SN standards, and by the standards on many American Brown Ales, I can live with it. A little toffee starts the beer and there is plenty of light roasted sweet malts to help it along. The finish and aftertaste seem to reflect a little too much bitterness for me, but to be honest it's short lived and fades pretty quickly. NOT a fruity beer, but still gives light touches and manages to stay away from jarring bitterness.
The beer does manage to retain an important quality of Brown Ales which is the moreish element. One is never quite enough so I credit SN for pulling that off.
So, we've managed to gt SN to dial back the hops and produce a very nice Brown Ale, now all we need to do is to take the ABV down to 4% so we can call this a session ale and it can take its proper place in the drinking rotation! That might be too much to wish for! All in all a success that should go well with some cooler weather."
Terrapin Beer Company,Terrapin Substance Abuse,,,American Double / Imperial Stout,?,on-tap,4.25,4,4,4,4.5,5,8/14/2010,"Sampled at Leon's Decatur for the ""Terrapin Takeover"" on 8/12/10. I went to this event specifically for this and Big Sloppy Monster, neither of which I had tried before.
Rumor had it that this was a '06 version but at the time there was no way to confirm.
Beer poured into a 10 oz glass looks much as expected. Jet black, but with a tan head that was a little smaller and less well-retained than other versions of this beer.
The combination of age and liquor element provides a beer that is astonishingly smooth. Virtually ALL the edges were taken off this and as a result the drinkability was incredibly high. For me the liquor and alcohol elements were almost completely missing, and they had been replaced by a velvet smooth creaminess. The only hint of alcohol was in the warming finish. Roast on the malts seems light, and overall the age has produce a beer with a light touch that kisses the palate. Very gentle drinking. Coffee elements have also faded, but this does not detract from the experience for me. A lot of sweetness and vanilla.
Delicious, but this will disappoint if you are looking for an aggressive, boozy, in your face beer."
Terrapin Beer Company,Terrapin Big Sloppy Monster,,,American Amber / Red Ale,8.30%,on-tap,3.83,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,8/14/2010,"On tap at Leon's, Decatur, Atlanta, GA, USA on 08/12/10 as part of the ""Terrapin Takeover"". Attended the event particularly for this beer and Substance Abuse.
10 oz pour.
The beer poured an alarmingly cloudy mid-brown with some serious yeastiness. The keg must have been terribly unsettled, and it wasn't until the second glass that I had (about an hour after the first), that I felt I had a handle on this. (It settled down in that time).
The beer had lost it's hoppy edge in the barrel and it had turned into a much milder beast. Age and liquor turned the Big Hoppy Monster into a tamed beast, and it would be difficult to draw comparisons between this and the original version. That isn't to say that I didn't enjoy the beer, I did, it was smooth and easy drinking, but it wasn't just a slightly amped up BHM - it had changed. to be expected I suppose. Some vanilla, muted hops and sweeter than i remember, but the beer is at least interesting and offers a decent experience.
Interesting."
De Struise Brouwers,Struise Tsjeeses,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,10.00%,bottle,4.33,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,8/13/2010,"11.2 oz bottle, $6.99 from CBX, Charleston, SC, USA. Lot B 9 09.
Deweer's ABB describes the name being derived from the brewer exclaiming, Tsjeese wat een lekker biertje, or ""Gee, what a nice little beer""! I'm not about to disagree.
Pour offers up a clouded, well hazed orange body with some sticky lace and froth. Burnt marmalade in color.
Nose offers some fruit peel and perhaps a touch of spice but it's not strong.
The tastes deliver some more, biter citrus notes including a lingering aftertaste. Touch of alcohol burn and some bracing acidity are also there. Even though the beer is described in many places as a ""spiced"" Christmas Ale, frankly it lacks some of the typical spice notes for me. Rather, the beer seems to deliver it's very distinct character with lemons, oranges and grapefruits and a splash of sharp lime.
Some noble hop elements, more alcohol warmth and a light Belgian candy note round out the beer against the final flash of bitterness.
Complex beer - lot's going on and NOT typical of a ""spiced"" beer at all. Coupled with the the fact this is definitely ""pale"" or ""blond"" (Christmas beers often often much darker malts), this beer is a bit of a surprise but drinks beautifully. Highly recommended."

Strange one this.
I think if you had given me this in a blind taste taste I would have sworn it was Yeungling! Now, you can take that any way that you like. I don't dislike Yeungling, but as we all know it's hardly a bastion of high quality beer so...
Pour is a pretty clear, mid-brown affair with a disappointingly poorly retained head and not much If any ) lace.
Nose and tastes produce a slightly yeasty, 100% non-offensive, light caramel malt and hop note which is pretty muted and reserved all around. Medium body. Attractive ABV to me, but lacks a lot of flavor to go with that particular subtlety.
The non-offensive nature of the beer means that there are no off-flavors as such and that the beer is pleasant enough to drink, but to be honest it's a touch bland. Definite Germanic character from the malts, but the beer lacks dept or defining moments."
Rogue Brewery (Brewer's on the Bay),Chatoe Rogue First Growth OREgasmic Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),6.00%,bottle,2.3,3,2.5,2,3.5,2,8/11/2010,"22 oz bottle from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour here offers a good, high head (deep and rich with a nice off-white color) that lingers. The color however, is a different matter - a turbid, murky, dirty brown that I don't care for. The color undoes the good work of the head IMO.
This is a VERY strange beer to me.
Firstly it does not look (or feel) like an APA at all. It seems to dark to me, and the tastes are odd.
This beer just seems overdone. At first the beer seems too malty. Then, in the next mouthfeel it feels too hoppy. It's as if there is a constant fight going on between the opposite ends of the flavor spectrum that never come to an agreement. there is conflict. It feels unbalanced to me, but in a way that I don't recall experiencing much. It's not that one element is too big, it's just that the character that is there seems to be in a constant battle with other tastes in the beer.
Many Rogue offering these days seem over-hopped to me and this beer goes a bit further and seems ""over-everythinged"". Odd beer, not good and so much so that the whole concept of GYO is completely lost here."
Sly Fox Brewing Company,Phoenix Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),5.30%,can,3.95,4,4,4,3.5,4,8/11/2010,"12 oz can from a recent trip to NY. Purchased at Finger lakes Beverage in Ithaca, NY, USA.
Nice pour with a good, solid copper colored body. Head is decent and leaves some pleasing, broken lace. Carbonation is mild but in proportion.
Nose offers good malts but also a lightly assertive bitterness - it has strength, but in no way do the hops overwhelm the beer or make it feel bitter.
Tastes offer a similar balance to the nose, and the beer works nicely. It's definitely ""American"" in the manner that it does have some significant bite and hop presence, however the malts keep pushing back to give some decent balance.
The beer offers a sensible ABV with PLENTY of taste. There is a good degree of assertiveness (a word which keeps coming to mind) and the hop note is both (paradoxically) aggressive and subtle.
High drinkability, a nice beer."
Thunderhead Brewing Company,Golden Frau Honey Wheat,,,Braggot,7.50%,can,2.68,3,2.5,2.5,3,3,8/11/2010,"12 oz can thanks to Kevin for a chance to try this beer. Astonished to see that this is a Braggot - to say that style is fairly rare is a significant understatement.
Alarmingly thin looking macro pour. The beer is VERY pale and lacks any depth in the color - not what I was expecting at ALL. Disappointing head and very watery.
Nose and tastes (somewhat unfortunately), follow suit and the lacks much presence at all. Some extra sweetness that one would expect, but after that the beer just seems lackluster and missing way too many distinguishing elements. Don't really know how to place it, but it feels weak and lacking several key characteristics.
Alcohol seems well hidden although there is a hint in the finish.
Blah - very disappointing on a number of levels. High hopes that are dashed."
Goose Island Beer Co.,Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,,,American Double / Imperial Stout,13.00%,bottle,3.9,4,4,4,4,3.5,8/10/2010,"Another example of how strangely one can get to taste these beers that are highly sought after without even trying.
I got to get a decent taste of this at a recent BA gathering in Charleston, but given the size of the pour and the amount of other beer being consumed I decided to pass on taking formal notes or writing a review, but I did make some mental notes. Then, a few days later, I unexpectedly got another chance to try the beer in a better light and make these observations.
Not much to report on the pour. Jet black with little or no head, motor oil appearance - not exactly shocking!
Nose gives up some pretty astringent alcohol and very little else for me.
The tastes were similar to the nose, and for all of my efforts to register as massive dose of coffee I simply did not get a big wave. The coffee for me was relegated almost entirely to the very back end of the beer, and to be honest it was a espresso note and not much else. The alcohol was there, as were some liquor notes and although prominent in each case I did not find them overpowering.
Considering everything, this was a pretty smooth beer to be honest, BUT definitely not as drinkable as the ""regular"" version of the brew. Small quantities (obviously), but the beer worked well, at least within the parameters that these things have to.
If you are looking for a coffee ""tasting"" beer then I don't think this is it. If you want a typical, VERY high alcohol sipper in the coffee/RIS/big/bourbon category then this will probably be for you. For me, too much going on to ever be a beer that I would actively seek out again."
Goose Island Beer Co.,Night Stalker,,,American Double / Imperial Stout,11.70%,bottle,3.6,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,8/10/2010,"22 oz bottle purchased on a recent trip to NY.
Pour is a very standard, jet black with a little ring of mocha lace that settles around the edges of beer, plus a thin film over most of the surface of the beer. Some decent alcohol legs on the side of the glass. Definitely menacing and viscous.
Nose and tastes reflect one another with all of the usual dark, roasted malt and chocolate notes that one would associate with this kind of beer, but with the added hop element that one usually does NOT find in this style. Surprisingly green and grassy too which puts me off a little.
The hop note fades for me and leaves a touch of smoke in the rear of the beer which is more to my liking, and fits better against the overall package than a true hop note does.
An interesting beer with the green notes, since I would not normally expect such a trait to a beer of this style, but ultimately not really what I'm looking for. An increase n the smokey element would be fine for me, but somehow the resin note needs to e dialed back for me to get excited about the beer.
Not thrilled, but having said that, this is a beer I would like to re-visit for pure interests' sake."
Brasserie à Vapeur,Vapeur En Folie,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,8.00%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,8/8/2010,"750 mL bottle, capped & corked from Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA. Cork comes out pretty easily with on a dull pop. Champagne style with large dimpled bottom. Green.
Pour is a golden orange with a fine, light froth for the head. Some good haze and the fine carbonation leads to some nice smoothness in the mouth.
Nose has some floral notes and a does of medicinal, estery, phenol. Not strong but noticeable.
There is a fairly large hop profile for a beer of this type. Of course, that's not to say that it's remotely ""hoppy"" as such, but there is a little medicinal note that feels oily and hop based. Some orange peel and cumin comes through, but even though they are detectable you would really put it down as a big note. Nicely classified in the BSPA category. A little extra lemon and citrus as it warms and I go down the bottle.
Alcohol is well-hidden and only gives a tiny bit of warmth.
The beer does have a touch of cardboard (a typical musty note) about it particularly in the finish, but to be honest that may be related to its age. Without any dates on the bottle, it's difficult to know. It doesn't detract very much from the experience anyway.
All in all a nice beer that drinks well and is enjoyable."

Nice pour, with a golden body and a fluffy, light, non-dense head.
An interesting beer to me since the upfront tastes seems to suggest some English influence (with some biscuit-like malts and some sweetness), but finishes with a decent amount of aggressive bitterness. Somewhat contradictory.
Some decent oily bitterness in the finish that manifest itself in an ""American"" manner.
Tasty and drinkable, another one of the growing legion of drinkable cans that can serve on multi-purpose trips to places where glass is not appropriate."

Other review (with more notes) for reference, here;
http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/3818/43687/?ba=Ding
The beer does have a slightly disappointing look in terms of head (or lack of it), even taking the ABV into full consideration.
The overwhelming experience here remains the toffee elements and the sweetness. On draft it seemed a little lighter than the bottle and the body was less intense. The outcome was that the beer became more drinkable in one way (in as much as you could drink MORE), but it a strange way less satisfying. For me, this is a beer where a more viscous, intense experience is better than a lighter, larger quantity. This particular beer works better as a liqueur-like experience.
Toffee dominates with some burned sugar in the finish."
SweetWater Brewing Company,Sweetwater Dank Tank Magnum IP,,,American Double / Imperial Pilsner,9.00%,bottle,3.5,4.5,3,3.5,3,4,8/7/2010,"22 oz bottle in the usual Dank Tank presentation. I've had this a few times before now, this is the bottled review.
Poured into the DFH glass, the beer is truly a deep golden color with (considering the ABV) a decent head and some retention.
The nose gives plenty of fusel alcohol notes but it's not overpowering. A little spice in the aroma too.
The tastes give up the usual (and expected) malty, alcoholic bitterness. There is some white pepper (especially in the finish), and a little dryness in the back end. Maybe a touch of honey coming through in the sweetness. Finishes with some extra bitterness and a little mire alcohol.
Also, the mouthfeel produces the expected viscosity and syrupy nature.
Very drinkable for the style, but it's all relative since this is a beer that can only be consumed in relatively small quantities. Still, if you happen to be seeking one of these Imperial Pilsners then this will do a decent job."

Beautiful light copper pour with superb clarity and a nice head and decent carbonation. Despite the glass being impeccably clean, the head is not retained well and there is no lace.
Clean malts and a light alcohol touch in the nose.
Tastes continue the clean feel with sharp malts giving way to some middle sweetness and then a dash of hops in the ending.
The aftertaste gives a pleasing and satisfying biscuit malt feel that is reminiscent of an English Pale Ale.
Very tasty and pleasing, an APA that isn't really an APA at all - more depth of character, and a beer that reminds me somewhat of an English style brew. Interesting.
Cans are a bonus and I could see this doing a job in many outdoor circumstances."
Weyerbacher Brewing Co.,Fifteen,,,American Double / Imperial Stout,10.80%,bottle,2.65,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,8/5/2010,"12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA.
Had this one on the fridge for a few weeks.
Jet black body with a few brown colors at the extremities. The body sets itself up with a very thin, wispy mocha film. A few legs and a little lace drips down the glass.
There really is very little smoke in the nose at all, and what little there might be is overwhelmed with booze anyway.
The beer also lacks much smoke element in the taste, too. The first wave of taste is a large sweetness, but this quickly gives way to a alcohol burn and a bitter finish. A little charcoal in the back end too, perhaps THIS is where the smoke manifests itself.
The bee is fairly thin for the style and doesn't really hit the typical depths for the style. Still not much smoke for me, and it seems as though the beer substitutes a burning bitterness for the smoke.
Disappointing that there isn't much smoke character and the beer is definitely one that I'm glad I tried only one, 12 oz bottle of."

Well, it needs to be said that this beer does not look like, or drink like, a Belgian Pale Ale. This is one thing that REALLY pisses me off. When a brewery puts the words ""Belgian Pale Ale"" on the label, it seems reasonable to assume that there is a Belgian Pale in the bottle - in this case there isn't, there's a beer that is much closer to a Dubbel, or at very least a Brune. It beer looks good as a ""beer"", but it looks awful as a ""Belgian Pale"".
Anyway, the pour is a dark brown with a creamy head that produces some nice lace and the cream is nicely persistent.
The nose and tastes are a combination of rich malts and a LOT of yeast - I mean a LOT of yeast. It's appealing in one way since the beer leaves you in no doubt about what its trying to do, but the strength of the yeast character is a little tiring toward the end of the bottle. It finishes with a touch of burnt sugar and more yeast. Also adds a dash of soap
Mouthfeel is rich and creamy which frankly is not the way a Belgian Pale should feel - it's nice, but a mess for the style.
What's going on here I cannot fathom. It's a tasty Dubbel, but it's a ridiculous BPA. This beer annoys me."

The beer pours a hazed orange with a tea-like appearance. No head, retention or lace to peak of. Looks a little ""dead"".
A lot of tropical fruit in the nose with an especially large emphasis on the pineapple for me. 
The beer drinks and tastes a little drier than the nose would suggest, but it still has a strong fruit note as opposed to any kind of wheat. The pineapple keeps coming and there is a touch of bitter aniseed in the finish. the bitterness could also be attributed to the clove element, but it's not very noticeable.
Despite the apparent lack of carbonation, the beer still drinks with a creamy mouthfeel.
Drinks and tastes better than it looks."
The Bruery,Trade Winds Tripel,,,Tripel,8.10%,bottle,4.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,7/25/2010,"The usual Bruery presentation in the 750 mL bottle from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA. The latest Bruery offering to arrive in GA.
Beautiful pour with plenty of fluffy white head that comes with good lace and retention. The color is interesting because it changes with the light more than most beers. In strong light there is a lovely, bright orange hue and in lower light it takes on a deeper, darker honey color. I like to see it in full light, but either way it looks great. It also exhibits a wide range of other orange shades between the extremes.
The nose gives a hint of the white pepper and alcohol that is to follow, but it gives very little of the herbal qualities that comes through in the initial tastes. The carbonation is just about perfect and lends of lovely, creamy quality to the beer which is a wonderful match for the style. More white pepper and the herbal flavors lend a certain bitterness to the beer that has a sweetness associated with the style.
To be honest this beer is a pretty herbal Tripel, so much so that it starts to touch upon the Saison area. A little more honey and a grassy herbal quality in the finish. The bitterness builds.
Super beer, well made and a pleasure to drink. You have to enjoy that slightly elevated herbal note, but if you do this is a beer for you."
Bison Brewing Co.,Bison Organic Imperial Brown Ale,,,American Brown Ale,7.00%,bottle,3.6,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,7/24/2010,"12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA.
Deep brown pour with a nice head. Not very good retention and no lace. Body has a few orange and rust colored highlights.
A barrage of sweet, bready malts in the nose and not hint of bitterness of alcohol.
The tastes still keep the malt based at the forefront, but add some alcohol and a little bit of bitterness to back up the idea that this is in the American end of the Brown Ale spectrum. Malts hold up well, and the alcohol never gets out of control.
In fact, the beer is pretty much EXACTLY what one would think of if you had to merge the ""Americanize"" and ""Imperialize"" a brown ale, so in that respect it's pretty much on the money. The debate as to whether a brown ale benefits from more alcohol and more hop character is a completely different one and perhaps left for another time."
Stone Brewing Co.,Stone 14th Anniversary Emperial IPA,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,8.90%,bottle,1.93,3.5,1.5,2,2.5,1.5,7/22/2010,"22 oz bottle, usual Stone presentation. Arbor Place Beverage, Douglasville, GA, USA.
OK, off the top I think the name is tacky. There, got that out of the way, now back to the beer.
Very light haze on the mid-orange pour. The body looks a bit like a cask pour. Not much lace as the beer forms a light, thin film on the surface which has some good retention.
The nose is very odd - it literally smells like cheese to me. Like a slightly overripe soft cheese - perhaps French. 
The tastes are a bruising assault on the taste-buds right off the bat, and to be honest it doesn't let up much. It's fairly abrasive and the abuse comes in waves of sweetness followed by a little bitter lemon peel and grapefruit. Not subtle (but then again who said it would be?), but it really attacks the mouth in a manner which screams Stone but lacks their usual skill. The cheese note also manifests itself a bit in the taste. There's some herbal, aniseed, nasty bitter notes in there somewhere, too.
On the plus side I do like the hoppy burps that it induces, and it does grow on you a little, but this is a poor beer by Stone's high standards.
After the absolute genius of 13th, this is a massive disappointment. A bitter, aggressive beer that lacks the Stone touch for pulling this kind of thing off. Edgy and very rough, the beer feels as though it's not yet finished.
As for English IPA - LOL, not in a contemporary sense. 0/5 for style."
Stone Brewing Co.,Saison Du BUFF,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,6.80%,bottle,2.68,3,3,2.5,3,2.5,7/22/2010,"12 oz single from a recent trip to NY.
The pour is a very bright orange color with a fizzy head that fades quickly to leave no lace but some thin film on the surface of the beer.
The nose is very strong. It's a sweet, citrusy, herbal mix with the emphasis on the herbs. This is something that I usually enjoy, but this seems unusually aggressive and wears a little.
The tastes reflect that nose, but here the orange-like citric notes come much more into play. There is also a soapy bitterness that manifests itself.
I don't actually dislike this beer, but to call it a Saison seems stretching it to me - it's just too bitter and has a weird, dark, gnawing hop presence which is out of place for me.
The alcohol warmth is just too great and the odd combination of flavors (pepper, lime and floral bitterness) don't sit very well together for me. It reminds me of getting a mouthful of shampoo when in the shower."
Brasserie Cantillon,Cantillon Fou' Foune,,,Lambic - Fruit,5.00%,on-tap,4.58,4.5,3.5,5,4,5,7/16/2010,"It's funny how these things work out, and over the years I learned that it's just SO much better to simply roll with the punches. What am I talking about? Well, for many years I;ve stared at bottle of this on the shelves in Atlanta and decide to pass - not a huge fan of Lambics. Then, as usual, all hell breaks loose with massive hysteria when news comes that Cantillon is/was will be/may be, NOT brewing this anymore. Cue panic buying and extreme geekery. I shrug my shoulders and content myself with knowing these just a huge amount of other, great beer that I can easily out my hand on.
....then, out of the blue, while visiting The Blind Tiger in NYC last Friday, there it is, on tap, right in front of me!
Poured into a small glass that was reminiscent of an Allagash White glass, the beer has a surprisingly bright orange hue with the usual cloudy body. To be honest, the cloudy body gives the beer a real depth, and it starts to look a little like a glass of orange juice. Th the extremities there is a little, watery lightness. Some delicate head and lace complete the picture.
The nose gives up very little to me, except a fresh, apple like acidity,
Tastes a re of some light fruit that I would not be able to recognize as a particular entity, but more than that the beer just has an extraordinary balance. It's tart, but very delicately so; it's fruity but in a very light way; it's also slightly sweet but in a manner that's lightly acidic. The combo certainly oozes class, as understatement is the watchword.
Insanely drinkable, and difficult to put down, and given the ABV this beer is really quaffable. The beer offers a really light touch all around without ever losing it's credibility or authenticity.
A lovely beer that I'm glad I got to - eventually and in a round about way!"
Ithaca Beer Company,White Gold,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,8.00%,bottle,2.88,2.5,3.5,3,3,2,7/16/2010,"750 mL bottle purchased at the brewery (or maybe Finger Lakes Beverage in Ithaca), either way, close to the source!
Batch: E!022
opening the cap gives me a gusher, and quite a profound one. It takes several minutes before the cascading, fine foam relents by which time maybe a quarter of the contents of the bottle are on the counter.
Poured in two separate portions into a 16 oz glass. The first pour gives a murky, yellow or butterscotch color with some good head. The head does fade rather fast though to leave some watery lace.
The nose gives an odd combo of light funk (unexpected) and some wheat notes. The taste reflect some of that, but also give a funky Belgian yeast taste and some alcohol sweetness - slightly Tripel like.
The second pour gives a much murkier body and as the yeast and sediment settles, some really NASTY looking green/gray particles. So nasty that I decided to drain-pour the last third of the glass rather than drink it. Normally I gobble up the yeasties but this really looked unappetizing.
Given the gushing, and the slightly funky tastes, I suppose it's possible that this beer COULD be a little infected, but it's difficult to tell for sure.
This is a bit of hybrid beer and I'm not sure tha tit works all that well."
Karl Strauss Brewing Company,Big Barrel Double IPA,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,9.00%,bottle,3.85,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,7/16/2010,"22 oz bomber, courtesy of BitterBill - thanks, Bill!
My first beer from Karl Strauss - excited to try it.
Pour is very standard for the style, with a high, fluffy and rocky head atop a slightly murky, mid-orange/brown body.
Nose and tastes reflect a very distinct fruitiness that seems like a combination of a number of things; grapefruit dominates, but you also get several other soft, tropical notes.
Well hidden alcohol.
One criticism for me is that the beer is a little muddled in the tastes. The tastes are good, but lack a clean, sharp edge which takes away some of the drinkability for me. If this could be improved a little, this beer would be really top class.
This beer reminds me a little of Coasts Boy King - it's not as good, but even to be mentioned in that manner is definitely a compliment."
The Bruery,Black Orchard,,,Belgian Dark Ale,5.70%,bottle,3.28,3,3.5,3.5,2.5,3,7/16/2010,"Happy to come across this on my recent trip to NY. This never made it to GA (The Bruery got here after this was done), so happy to hook myself up! Also glad to to see a more sensible ABV from The Bruery on this one for a change.
Popped the cap on the 750 mL, usual style Bruery bottle (I do like their labels) and the pour is an impressive JET black! A few gold highlights at the extremities, but otherwise pretty solid. 
Carbonation is annoyingly fizzy. It detracts from the smoothness, leaves little or no head and the lace is basically nil. Prickly mouthfeel results which is bearable, but little more. Sits there looking like a Coke.
Nose and tastes are light, roasted malts with a hint of bitterness and licorice but very restrained and subtle. Alcohol too is subtle, and the beer drinks like a very mild stout or perhaps a watery porter. Not much Belgian character.
To be honest, the beer drinks a bit better than my last paragraph would suggest! There is a decent maltiness to it, and a bread character that I enjoyed. A hint of chocolate and dry cocoa and a touch of Belgian character comes through in the back end and finish, as does the slight bitterness.
In the end, quite tasty and glad I tried it, BUT the fizzy carbonation and subsequent mouthfeel were turn-offs for me. I think the beer is a bit better than my scores would suggest."
Sly Fox Brewing Company,Route 113 India Pale Ale,,,American IPA,7.00%,can,3.98,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,7/14/2010,"12 oz can.
Very interesting beer.
The pour gives an amazingly dark, copper color with superb clarity. The copper color is pronounced and quite dark for the style. Nice head, decent lace, good looker.
There is a real, significant bitterness in the nose and initial tastes, but these change to a quite obvious, herbal, earthy, light spiced hop note. It feels quite organic.
The beer lacks any real dry character (that I was expecting), but still delivers a firm finish. Hints of grapefruit are also present.
All in all absolutely delighted."
Sly Fox Brewing Company,Pikeland Pils,,,German Pilsener,4.90%,can,2.93,4,3.5,2.5,3,3,7/14/2010,"12 oz can.
I've heard quite a lot about this beer over the years, and some of it I suspect has been simply because it has been canned; there seems to be a mild hysteria that accompanies some canned beers where people get ahead of themselves and forget to worry about what the beer actually tastes like!
Pour is a well carbonated, golden body with some decent head. the lace is not huge, but a decent, semi-thick film hangs around on the surface of the beer.
A strange, citrusy, lemon like smell that surprised me, but that I quite like.
The tastes are less impressive, with a malty sweetness that has a certain macro quality. Not good. Some soapy character (which I sometimes like but seems way out of place here) and a little bit of bitterness in the finish. I like the bitterness but it lacks a clean edge to leave me unhappy.
Clearly a beer that has been hyped because of the can angle, and is one that is not quite as good as people imagine."
Brewery Ommegang,Rare Vos (Amber Ale),,,Belgian Dark Ale,6.50%,on-tap,4.13,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,7/10/2010,"Apparently the house beer brewed by Ommegang for BXL in NYC, NY is actually not a new beer at all, but it's actually Rare Vos. Reported as an alias. Consumed today at BXL East on 51st.
Pour is a mid-amber one with impressive head and lace. The lace is especially pleasing.
A LOT of yeasty, bread notes in this beer that dominate both the nose and the taste. Excellent combination of sweetness and competing dark(er) dry character. Some fruit as well, the beer almost has a plum or other dark fruit note. In that respect it slides toward a Belgian Dark area, but never gets anywhere near that as the beer is light and very drinkable.
An amber, mid-brown aspect that is Dubbel-like.
Tasty and moreish with plenty of bread in the feel.
Excellent brew that I REALLY enjoyed as it took the edge of walking around the city in some seriously hot weather. I could have sat here and had several of these without any effort."
Clipper City Brewing Co. / Heavy Seas Beer,Heavy Seas Cabernet Barrel Aged Below Decks,,,English Barleywine,10.00%,bottle,2.9,2,3,3,2.5,3,6/30/2010,"22 oz bottle form Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
I've become really wary of this series from Clipper City because frankly, the beers have been pretty poor. I'm a little more optimistic about this one though, since I liked the original Below Decks so there would appear to be some solid ground to build upon.
The pour is NOT attractive. A watery light brown with no head retention, lace or indeed much of a film.
Underneath this beer is a decent ENGLISH styled BW. Obviously if you are looking for a big, brash, bold, American BW with a large hop presence you not going to find it here, because Below Decks is not that beast. The sweetness and malt still make themselves felt and the Cabernet gives a definite vinous quality, but they sit a little awkwardly in conjunction with one another. A bit too much fusel alcohol in the finish which makes the beer harsher than it really should be considering this is an English styled BW.
Thinnish in the mouth, it ultimately fails to please.
Still a VERY disappointing beer for me and another loser in the series."
Alaskan Brewing Co.,Alaskan Baltic Porter,,,Baltic Porter,9.90%,bottle,4.15,2.5,4.5,4.5,3,4,6/27/2010,"22 oz bottle thanks to BitterBill for the opportunity.
2009 Vintage.
Pour is a standard black, with some brownish highlights at the extremities. Head appears quickly but it is very ""fizzy"" and then it dies immediately. Coupled with the color, the beer looks EXACTLY like a freshly poured Coke - exactly. The head (or rather the lack of it) is rather disappointing and although the color is good but the overall appearance is not all that thrilling.
The nose gives a heap of sweet molasses and vanilla and a lot of rich, marzipan/almond based notes. Very attractive.
The tastes reflect some of that, and the tastes give a little more alcohol than the nose would suggest. Lovely, warming sherry like character in the finish and a gentle kiss of bitter licorice in the ending. Really tasty with some lovely brown sugar and delicate alcohol heat. Small amount of detectable evaporation on the tongue. The sherry adds massively to the experience for me. Some big, bold forest fruits and a healthy dose of rich, caramel based malt.
Scores are ALL over the place here. The appearance is a bit disappointing because of the apparently high carbonation for the style, but the color is good. The mouthfeel lacks depth and smoothness because of the fizzy carbonation, but the nose and tastes are both great. Drinkability is good too.
Nice, but for me the fizzy nature ultimately slightly detracted from what would otherwise be a stellar beer. I'd like to try this with some age."
Alpine Beer Company,Nelson,,,American IPA,7.10%,bottle,4.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,6/26/2010,"22 oz bottle courtesy of BitterBill. Thanks Bill!
Pour produces a beautiful color. A really rich orange and an excellent head with some sticky lace. Very nice to look at.
The nose and the tastes are one and the same and exhibit and extraordinary deep, clean and sharp hop note. The hop is, without question, a unique one and the cleanliness of it is what stands out for me. Overall the beer does exhibit a large, West Coat hop feel, but at the same time it seems incredibly light. Plenty of sweet malt adds to the mix and the beer seems really well balanced. I'm not a fan of rye at all, but to be honest it doesn't seem have much bearing on the beer.
Alcohol seems lower than 7.1% and the beer drinks very easily. I get plenty of citrus but it's much more tangerine than grapefruit. This adds to the drinkability.
I was a little wary of the potential for hype with this top 100 beer (#74 as I type), but to be honest in the end it pretty much delivered. Nice beer, and great use of the hops. Tasty and moreish."
Brewery Ommegang,Ommegang Zuur,,,Flanders Oud Bruin,6.00%,bottle,4.53,4,4,4.5,5,5,6/25/2010,"750 mL corked and caged, Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Damaged cork pops out ALARMINGLY quickly ( http://beeradvocate.com/forum/read/2851950 ).
Pour is a resplendent dark brown with a pretty decent amount of carbonation when considering the style. No lace to speak of, but a thin film on the surface of the beer and a nice collar of foam at the extreme edges.
Mild, fruity acidity in the nose but nothing too ethanoic acid based.
Tastes are very gentle with the beer not really living up to its name. A nice, fruity, sweet and sour taste meets the palate but not a great deal of cherry taste. The bitter cherry skins do kick-in a little as the beer warms, and the carbonation is fine, light and pleasing. A touch more apple like acidity completes the picture. Smooth and silky with a lot of fine bubbles dancing on the tongue to stimulate the senses and add to the mild sour notes.
VERY drinkable, and very approachable. Not at all ""sour"" as such, more of a fine balance of flavors and sensations. Mouthfeel (gentle, fine bubbles) also a high point for me.
A super beer that really speaks to me."
Clipper City Brewing Co. / Heavy Seas Beer,Heavy Seas - Smoke On The Water,,,Smoked Beer,8.00%,bottle,2.48,3,2.5,2.5,3,2,6/25/2010,"22 oz bottle from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
This is now a serious pattern rather than a few blips in the Big Beer series from Heavy Seas/Clipper. This is just not a very good beer - ANOTHER poor effort in the series.
Pour is fine with the standard black body and a decent amount of early carbonation. Head fades quickly; no lace or retention to speak of.
Nose gives virtually no smoke element which in itself is not an encouraging thing, but when the beer warms and there is only a tiny change and still no significant smoke it goes from disappointing to not good.
The beer offers virtually no smoke in the taste and there is a persistent acidity that I don't care for. A strange dry character afflicts the finish and the aftertaste is chalky and bitter. None of the cream notes that I would like to enjoy.
Drinkability is very low and the second half of the bottle goes down the drain. Poor beer IMO and the worrying thing is now that I've seen this in a whole succession of this series. They appear to be coming out at alarming rate with not much regard for the quality. Bleh."

OK, pretty interested to find my first Thornbridge beer in the US, There's been plenty of talk about this brewery and I'm keen to make up my own mind and to experience some of their beers for myself.
Very unusual appearance. In a nutshell the beer resembles a Hefe in terms of the color. A hazy, orange, butterscotch affair with some fizzy carbonation. Head is small and not very well retained by does give some lace. Not what I was expecting at all.
Nose and tastes both threaten a big grapefruit attack, but both back away VERY quickly to give a lot of sweetness. The beer leaves a residual grain-like sweetness and it lingers. There's some sickly, honey like notes and a syrupy feel that gets a little tedious.
The alcohol, although hidden in terms of the taste, does start to accumulate and begins to tire the palate a little.
Frankly I didn't care for this a great deal and I'm not sure what the beer is trying to be."
Brooklyn Brewery,Brooklyn Sorachi Ace,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,7.60%,bottle,3.05,3.5,4,2.5,3.5,3,6/20/2010,"750 mL corked & aged beer from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA. 
Always very excited to try a new beer from Brooklyn, especially one in one of my favorite styles.
The pour has a beautifully rich, butterscotch, lemon yellow hue, but to be honest the head, lace and retention are not all that great.
The nose delivers the lemongrass aroma as advertised. Quite attractive.
The taste is where things start going a little awry for me. There is no doubt that the Sorachi Ace delivers an absolutely unique taste, but to be honest I don't care for it much. There is a herbal and soapy quality to the beer that COULD be good, but unfortunately it fails for me. There is a distinct soap taste that some hops can deliver (I think of Courage beers from the UK from many years ago), but this LITERALLY delivers a soap taste which is not what I want. In addition, the herbal quality is not like that I've found in many other beers - it's a little grating and just way too floral.
I'm a little disappointed in this beer. Lots of potential, exciting to try, but in the end it just doesn't work for me. The Sorachi taste profile doesn't sit well with me. A good idea that just doesn't work with the taste buds.
Not a ""bad"" beer by any stretch of the imagination rather for me, it simply didn't TASTE very good!"
Pivovar Náchod a.s.,Primátor Double Bock Beer,,,Doppelbock,10.50%,bottle,3.53,4,4,3.5,3.5,3,6/20/2010,"500 mL bottle, different to the current presentation in the BA db and a $2.99 purchase at Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Let me preface this sentence by saying that I am a fan of malty, sweet, non-hop forward brews, and I am VERY experienced in the Doppelbock style so I know what to expect, BUT...WOW, this SUPER, SUPER Sweet! I mean in a way that I don't remember encountering for a long, long time!
Pour is the standard, deep brown almost black color with a small, coffee-like head that fades quickly. Not much lace, but that's OK, it's a pretty high ABV beer. Nevertheless, still solid looking. Quite acceptable.
Nose gives the expected sweetness, but the sugar tastes PILE on in a very harsh manner. Not really syrupy (which is the surprising thing, but sweet beyond all belief. WOW! I love sweet, malt based beers and I was expecting a pretty sugary brew based on the style, but this surpassed all expectations. Lots of molasses and honey and frankly not much else. The sugar gives a decent depth to the mouthfeel (full), but obviously detracts somewhat from the drinkability.
Interesting bee as it flirts with the style. An over-sweet Doppelbock which is a thing I wasn't sure was possible. As Ken Wolstenholme would say, ""It is now""!"
Terrapin Beer Company,Terrapin Boom Shakalager,,,Märzen / Oktoberfest,9.00%,bottle,2.6,2.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,2,6/19/2010,"22 oz bottle as part of the Side Project Series, this one is #11. The usual gold-foiled presentation.
Pour is a surprisingly dark amber in color. The head is largely absent and the retention and lace are close to zero. Disappointing.
Nose gives some phenols and a little fusel alcohol in the back end of the finish.
It's a pretty viscous and heavy beer, but to be honest, given the style that's in line and OK, but it certainly does not add to the drinkability. There's a little marzipan in the beer and the syrupy feel does gets a bit much, pretty quickly for me.
Lots of extra alcohol comes through in the finish and there is a mild burn. Sugar sweetness overwhelms the beer and there is a lack of bitterness that one would hope for in a beer of this style/type. I'd like a bit of extra bitterness and a less heavy feel to the beer, but ho hum. Mild burn in the finish too. Lacks the energy of a Sam Adams Imperial Pilsner for me.
In the end this is a bit of a yawn (again) from the SP series. I'd really appreciate a lower ABV beer in this group."
New Belgium Brewing,Eric's Ale (Lips Of Faith #3),,,American Wild Ale,7.00%,bottle,4.48,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,6/18/2010,"22 oz bottle from Green's on Ponce.
Got lucky with this one. Brickstoredave gave a few of us a blind sample and I (like most others) loved it. I then proceeded to miss the very few bottles that came to GA. A week or so later, apparently a small second wave made it back to the state and I stumbled on to one - lucky me, this is a SUPER beer!
Pour gives lovely clarity from the bottle with plenty lively carbonation out of the bottle that subsides quickly to leave a thin film on the surface. Golden orange reminiscent of lucozade.
Nose gives a combination of mild acidity and mild funk but not hint of the peach juice.
Smooth. Smooth. Light funk, and the dry character is perfectly balanced - not too aggressive at all. Light fruit in the back that i would NOT necessarily associate with peaches, but nevertheless has a certain, mild ester note. Lots of typical, Somerset/Devon scrumpy stuff going on which is the way a great Wild Ale should feel IMO. Rustic and authentic. The apple cider notes increase, ad with them a lovely warming, volatile acidity.
As it warms and as one drinks more, it mellows out further and the beer becomes amazingly drinkable."
BrewDog,Trashy Blonde,,,English Pale Ale,4.10%,bottle,3.73,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,6/17/2010,"12 oz single courtesy of James all the way from Scotland. many thanks.
Beer pours with an impressive rocky, white head which gives some super lace. Body is a slightly hazed, golden pour with mid to low carbonation - a smashing looking beer.
Nose gives some typical sweet malts abut also a little white peppery bitterness.
The beer drinks very dry with a lack of malt presence for a beer in the English pale Ale category. There is a very stout, Saaz-like, crisp bitterness which gives a little pepper, and given the relative lack of malt character, I might have even guessed the style of this beer to be that of a Pilsner. The finish mimics the style too, with more lingering bitterness, a dry aftertaste and more cracked grains.
This is a pretty tasty beer with a lot of flavor packed in (take note you lower ABV beer bashers), but it's a bit strange for the style. There's a lack of malt presence which doesn't make it a beer that doesn't taste good, but it does make it a beer that is not really"

Blah, ultimately very disappointed consider the supposed gravity of this series.
The biggest problem here was the carbonation and general life associated with the beer - in the end nothing but flat and dull.
Pour was a surprisingly dark, mid-copper body with some large bubbles and a decent head. The problems started as the head faded, both quickly and badly. It left a brown; literally ""dead"" liquid in the glass which was flat and unappealing. All of this after a decent pop from the corked and caged bottle and some significant gun-smoke.
Nose and tastes gave a crisp, Saaz-like edge (which sat a little oddly against the color of the beer) and there was a good peppery, cracker feel about the initial tastes. The alcohol seemed to build though, and as it did the beer became heavier and less appealing. Coupled with the hard work associated with the body it really slowed the beer down. It got heavy and cumbersome very quickly. This beer was in STARK contrast to something like Rogues recent Maierfest offering which showcased all the great things about the style - this showed virtually none.
Extremely disappointed and a really poor beer when you consider the fact that this was supposed to be something special. One of my favorite styles, badly missed by SN."
Evolution Craft Brewing Company,Exile ESB,,,Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB),5.80%,bottle,3.2,3,3.5,3,3,3.5,6/15/2010,"12 oz bottle from lackenhauser as part of Veterans BIF.
Pour is a touch on the light side of amber and also gives quite a lot of murkiness. Head is average, dissipates quickly and leaves a little watery lace. The head is not too much of a problem, but the color and lack of clarity give me a little cause for concern.
Nose has plenty of sweet malts and a little fruit.
The tastes reflect some of the nose but also have a touch of acid and some prickly carbonation. The light acidity seems to replace the hop bitterness that otherwise might be there. Dry finish where I would like to see some more, biscuit like malts.
It's OK, and I think has potential but to be honest I think this beer has some work to do. It's either got to up the malts make it a typical English ESB, OR up the hop character to give it a bigger American twist. For now it sits somewhere between the two and it doesn't quite make it."
New Belgium Brewing,Lips Of Faith Belgian Style Blond Ale,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,8.50%,bottle,3.85,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,6/13/2010,"Golden pour with some delightful looking, full, frothy head that leaves some great lace. Good clarity on the pour. Attractive looking beer.
Smells and tastes replicate a light yeast note with a touch of sweetness.
The beer is pretty well balanced and as such it *could* be a potential stepping stone for a non-craft drinker. However, the problem is really the ABV. Even though the alcohol is very well hidden, the beer still creeps up on you a little, and even though the alcohol does not necessarily manifest itself too much in the taste, it still comes through strongly in the effect. There's a little residual sugar too in a typical Belgian candy way. Strangely the beer still drinks easily with a light touch that does not get syrupy.
I like this beer, but the name, the time of year and the relatively light mouthfeel ALL demand a beer that is easier to drink, and on that note this fails. Anyway, tasty but a beer the ought to be easier to consume."
Shmaltz Brewing Company (He'Brew),He'Brew Rejewvenator (Year Of The Grape) 2010,,,Doppelbock,8.20%,bottle,4.63,3.5,4,5,4,5,6/13/2010,"22 oz bottle from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA. 2010 version, ""The Year of the Grape"".
Very typical of the Rejewvenator series. Described on the label as half Doppelbock, half Dubbel!
A difficult to beer to classify but delicious and rich in malt just like the rest of the Rejewvenator series. The Shmaltz beers all seem to have a deep, richness about them both in terms of the color and the depth of flavor and this beer is absolutely no exception.
A nice, noisy pour with a very rich, reddish brown hue and a tea-colored head. The beer does not hold the head very well or create any lace, but based upon the ABV (8.2%) that's not too much of an issue. As it warms there are more and more caramel malts with a lovely, light marzipan background - delicious. Burned, light brown sugar with a touch of molasses too. Wow!
The beer is very vinous indeed. A sharp, tart sweet and sour combo with plenty of fruit and some yeasty character. there's a touch of bitterness in the back end and more grape character in the aftertaste. A little fortified wine character in there as well.
Extremely drinkable, very fruity and incredibly moreish. A sweetness that is pleasing and combined with the Belgian yest notes this is a VERY intriguing beer. Tasty and delicious, I want more!"
Williams Brothers Brewing Company,Midnight Sun,,,English Porter,5.60%,bottle,4.03,4.5,4,4,4,4,6/13/2010,"500 mL bottle thanks to lackenhauser as part of Veterans BIF.
Pour is a very solid, jet black body with any initially large, light coffee colored head. Some lace is left along with a thin film on the surface of the beer.
The first few sips seem a touch on the bitter side, BUT after a few minutes of warmth and a few more sips the beer starts to take on the flavor profile that a beer of this style demands.
Some light licorice amongst the slightly sour cream like notes. Some more sweetness comes through with a few medicinal, bitter and herbal flavors. The herbal nature builds and becomes quite a prominent feature. Alcohol is well hidden and the finish is neutral (in a good way).
Pretty interesting beer that stays true to a low-hopped, relatively creamy based beer that does a nice job."
Brewer's Art,Brewer's Art Green Peppercorn Tripel,,,Tripel,9.20%,bottle,3.43,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,6/6/2010,"750 mL corked and caged bottle. Thanks to lackenhauser as part of Veterans BIF.
Clouded orange body with plenty of thick, yeast sediment coming from the depths of the bottle. Head is initially a high, white affair but it fades quickly to leave a thin film and a white ring at the edges of the beer.
There is a lot of fruit (pineapple especially) and alcohol up front as one would expect, and then there's a traditional white pepper note as well, but the finish brings that much greener, fuller, bigger feel that the peppercorn addition gives. It's a good combo and it works really well since the pepper has a naturally synergy with the style.
So, the beer comes together nicely, BUT the alcohol and taste combo just gets too much, too quickly.It's VERY hard work after the first 6-8 oz and the syrup, spice, fruit and alcohol just get too much for me. Two or three points down on the ABV scale would help, but for now it's just a bit too much for me to handle."
Flying Fish Brewing Company,Exit 16,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,8.20%,bottle,3.85,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,6/6/2010,"750 mL capped bottle, thanks go out to lackenhauser for the chance to try this.
Pour is a cloudy, orange color with a nice head. Some decent retention and some sticky lace. Very good, and solid for the style.
Nose offers a typical, west coast, hop-resin astringency. Not something that I care for necessarily, but definitely true to the style.
The beer does not stray much from the style with massive, astringent hops, slightly dry in the finish and plenty of grapefruit and oily, resin notes. In the end, very little to report. Alcohol is there too, but the beer remains drinkable.
This is a beer that hits the main points for the style without impressing greatly or disappointing."
Southern Tier Brewing Company,Hop Sun (Summer Wheat Beer),,,American Pale Wheat Ale,4.90%,on-tap,4,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,6/5/2010,"Had this a few times in the last week or so, both on tap and from the bottle. Definitely preferred the draft version and this review reflects that serving style.
Bright orange pour with a decent amount of cloudiness. Seems clearer on draught than from the bottle which adds extra haze. Nice, high, substantial white head.
In both cases I got a really decent amount of soap character in the taste. The hop presence seems to work up quite a big taste considering the style of the beer. If the soap taste is done right I really enjoy it in a beer; reminds me of the old days of Courage Best and Courage Director's. Finish is clean and reflects a touch more citrus (tangerine) than we found on the front end.
The beer is refreshing and satisfying at the same time.
Really enjoyed this beer, and to be honest one of the better Southern Tier beers that I've had of late."
Williams Brothers Brewing Company,Williams Gold,,,English Pale Ale,3.90%,bottle,3.63,3,3.5,3.5,3,4.5,6/5/2010,"Big thanks go out to lackenhauser. Received as part of The BA Veterans BIF.
Marketed in the USA as ""Scottish Session Golden Ale"" which seems VERY odd since the word ""session"" is so abused here. I don't get it at all.
500 mL bottle, nice label. Best Before Jul 2011 which seems odd given the probable, relative fragility of this beer.
Mixed feelings about this beer. 
Firstly I am absolutely delighted that we get a TRUE session beer (&lt;4%), and that it's called ""Session"" too. Label says 3.9%. On the other hand I shun the ""Golden Ale"" part of the name/beer. I've always though that the dawn of the English ""Golden Ale"" is really a reaction to dumbing down the traditional bitter, so in that respect I'm very much against it. Anyway, on to the beer in the glass.
Pour is a golden color with rather a lot of large bubbles present. Not much depth, and the head, retention and lace are not great. It's a touch thin in the mouth.
The nose has a sweet, malty start but also incorporates a surprisingly organic grassiness in the back end.
A LOT of flavor is packed into this beer, and anyone that thinks lower ABV beers do not have large flavor profiles needs to think again and taste this beer. Having said that, it delivers in an odd way that I don't necessarily approve of. The beer is shockingly dry when you consider the type of beer it is trying to be. There is a real lack of sweet malts, and it comes across as being quite ""hoppy"". Don't get me wrong, under NO circumstances is this a hop based beer per se, but the organic, dry, hay-like feel is surprising and prominent which takes away from the small malt presence even further.
Reminds me a little of an old-fashioned, ""Light Ale"".
Despite the slightly disappointing aspects for me, the beer is still hugely drinkable."
Flying Dog Brewery,Wild Dog Double Pale Ale,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,9.00%,bottle,3.58,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,6/4/2010,"Massive thanks go out to BEERchitect for the chance to finally try this beer!
750 mL, corked & caged bottle, from September 2004, this was bottle #1466. Thick, heavy green glass with dimpled bottom. Substantial bottle.
Pretty much exactly as I anticipated to be honest.
The beer pours with a large amount of cloudiness and a significant amount of yeasty, floaties. Some carbonation seems to have dropped off (only a small pop on opening and it drinks with little life), but the head and retention are incredibly impressive with a really rocky, off-white crown on the brown body.
Nose and tastes come forward with some mild oxidation on top of what was once a really hoppy beer. The tastes have obviously become much less well defined and somewhat muddy, but for me that's often preferable to a massive, smack you in the face hop bomb. There is a fair amount of sweetness and the beer still packs a pretty decent alcohol punch. Some carbonation seems to have dropped off (only a small pop on opening and it drinks with little life), but the head and retention are incredibly impressive with a really rocky, off-white crown on the brown body.
Purists will hate the fact that this beer is now 6 years old before it was consumed, but to be honest I still enjoyed it immensely and I bet that I would have like it less when it was fresh."
McAuslan Brewing,St-Ambroise Oatmeal Stout,,,Oatmeal Stout,5.00%,bottle,3.65,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,6/4/2010,"12 oz single from Green's on Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour is a standard black body with some initially good head but the retention is not great. Lace is minimal, but we do get a ring on the surface of the beer.
Light roast greets the nose and taste, and to be honest this beer never gets too demanding. In that respect I like it, and the drinkability of the beer remains good throughout the bottle.
Light lactose and licorice combine nicely to give a smooth mouthfeel which is no doubt enhanced by the oatmeal.
Standard, but solid offering within the style and a beer I would happily try again and one that I would like to experience on draught."
Atwater Block Brewery,Atwater Cherry Stout,,,American Stout,6.50%,bottle,2.8,3.5,3.5,2.5,3,2.5,5/31/2010,"12 oz single.
Really not sure what's going on with this.
A dark brown body with a decent enough head, but it fades pretty quickly to leave very little lace. Poor retention.
Nose gives a little malty chocolate.
The tastes are odd. The cherry obviously manifests itself, but to be honest it is simply a sour, ""beer gone off"" type taste. It's odd. I can't really work out if the beer is rancid, or if the cherry notes are indeed supposed to taste that way! Difficult to distinguish between the (potentially) good and the (obviously) bad. Weird.
A little more fruit in the aftertaste and the acidity drops off a bit.
Interesting and peculiar beer to pt it mildly. Might be interesting fresh, near the source and perhaps even out of a cask, but from the bottle and a long way from home it's all over the place."
Fort Collins Brewing,Chocolate Stout,,,American Stout,5.30%,bottle,2.65,3.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,2,5/31/2010,"12 oz bottle as a single from Total Wine, Perimeter, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour gives a still looking, dark brown body with some spotty lace on top of the mill pond body.
Nose and tastes reveal some gentle, dry, bakers chocolate (cocoa) like notes. Light acidity falls in the back end. The beer seems to round out with an odd, solvent like feel and another blast of acid. Not much to like here.
Mouthfeel is a bit weak and this doesn't help the apparent acidity much at all. Beer with not a lot of presence.
Tastes are light chocolate with a smattering of dry hops but not much else. Lacks much malt depth for me.
One and done for me, here."
Saint Louis Brewery / Schlafly Tap Room,Schlafly Coffee Stout,,,Oatmeal Stout,5.70%,bottle,2.93,2.5,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,5/31/2010,"12 oz single.
Amazed at how light the pout on this is. No hint of any kind of blackness from a typical stout, rather the body is akin to a red or amber ale and lacks depth in the look. Head is minimal. Actually looks like cold tea.
Nose has a strong coffee aroma and the tastes reflect that. However, not much depth at all, and definitely quite light - even watery. Mouthfeel is correspondingly weak and disappointing especially considering this is supposed to be (apparently) an oatmeal version where one would expect some depth.
Light acid mixed in with the coffee. Some acidic bitterness completes the picture.
A forgettable beer all around."
Tröegs Brewing Company,Tröegs Java Head Stout,,,Oatmeal Stout,7.50%,bottle,3.48,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,5/31/2010,"12 oz single.
Nice deep brown/black body with plenty of high, mocha head. Head color is particularly pleasing.
Roasty and dry in the nose and the roast continues in the initial tastes. Some light, teeth coating tannins come forth quickly with some alcohol in there too. SA little organic tree bark and a green, fresh hop note also present. Perhaps a touch of smoke in th aftertaste.
A bright beer that gives the impression of being drop-hopped. The oatmeal doesn't make its presence felt in the one place that you would expect - the mouthfeel. It seems to lack any depth considering the addition of the grain.
Bitterness lingers in the finish with some serious dry character - seems like a dry version of a stout in the back end.
Alcohol is well hidden."
Avery Brewing Company,Avery Anniversary Ale - Seventeen (Dry Hopped Black Lager),,,Schwarzbier,8.70%,bottle,3.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,5/30/2010,"The usual Avery presentation with gold foil on the neck.
Glad to see the Avery Anniversary series come back to Atlanta after the very strange omission of sixteen after we've had the others.
Pour is at first glance a solid black, but closer inspection reveals a browner appearance that first thought. Head is good, but fades quickly and little or no lace is left.
Lots of licorice notes and quite a bitter twang in the finish. This comes after a more gentle start that showcases some simple, sweet malts quite nicely. Hop bitterness is quite restrained as the malts hold up well.The licorice really is the dominating factor here for me, and it get a bit medicinal in the finish.
This has the potential to be a really satisfying, sweet and refreshing beer but unfortunately the alcohol level really spoils it for me. It builds and builds and about half way through the bottle it feels like I'm drinking every single drop of the almost 9% beer. Would be better at half the ABV for me.
Apart from the alcohol presence I like the beer, but the ethanol really curbs the drinkability."
Hoppin' Frog Brewery,Wild Frog Wheat Ale,,,Hefeweizen,6.00%,bottle,3.75,2,4,4,3.5,3.5,5/30/2010,"22 oz bottle from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
A surprisingly dark pour that takes on a honey-orange color. Head is really disappointing considering the style, in fact one of the worst I ever recall seeing for a Hefe. Virtually zero head or retention. The darker than usual color I can cope with, the lack of head is a no-no for the style.
Pretty good pineapple, banana and clove in the nose and tastes with for me, the emphasis on a candied pineapple sweetness. It tends to build and get a bit tiring after a while, but tasty all the same.
Seems a touch syrupy in the mouth.
Drinkability is pretty good, although the alcohol also seems to build a bit, and in the end after 22 oz I've had enough."
SweetWater Brewing Company,Sweetwater Sch'Wheat,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,4.70%,bottle,2.3,1.5,2,2.5,2,2.5,5/30/2010,"12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
After a few seconds of settling down, the pour gives a very suspiciously clear, macro-esque body and a head that fades badly. Despite the description on the label, the beer looks as though it has been filtered and in that respect it's horribly disappointing.
It's difficult to see how this beer creates much of a ""wheat"" effect at ALL. From the clarity of the look, to the lack of head and the largely watery body, the beer looks and drinks much more like a macro lager than anything else. Almost zero depth in the mouth.
Perhaps a touch of citrus freshness in the taste, but it is also muted to say the least. Corny taste in the finish. Reminds me a little of a Bud Lite lime - gulp!
Not really offensive in any way, but a weak effort and especially considering it is replacing the much better Hummer. Disappointing all around."
Rogue Brewery (Brewer's on the Bay),John John Juniper,,,Herbed / Spiced Beer,5.20%,bottle,4.23,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,5/27/2010,"Picked up the latest of the John John series to make it to Atlanta at Green's on Ponce. 22 oz bottle.
Not really excited by the first one in the series, but this one seems to offer more potential for me.
Color is an attractive, slightly hazed, golden body with a fine, wispy head. Not much retention or lace but a good color.
Nose offers little other than some sweet malts and perhaps a touch of alcohol.
Tastes are what I would call refined. A very tasty, noticeable light, citrus and herbal twang which come together very nice in the finish. Clean and a hint of more mixed, herbs, the flavors are floral and very aromatic. Very drinkable, thirst quenching and light. Light lemon finishes it off. A bit like a SERIOUS fruit beer.
Full disclosure: I'm a fan of gin, and that may make a difference here.
Delicious and I enjoyed this more than most of the bourbon/whiskey barrel aged beers that I've had in the past."
Terrapin Beer Company,Terrapin The Iron Tankard,,,Old Ale,9.40%,bottle,3.98,3.5,4,4,4,4,5/27/2010,"Impressive presentation, but also an impressive price (between $13 and $16), but when you consider the beer is being sold as a vehicle to make money for what they consider a good cause, it makes it slightly more palatable. Slightly. Hand numbered bottle 4480/4884.
22 oz bottle, boxed with a gold foiled neck.
Cloudy, hazed mid-amber pour that creates little or no head with poor retention. Just about zero lace. OK, I guess when you consider the ABV and the style.
Nose gives a sugary, malty, slightly liquor based aroma - not strong, but basically as expected for the style.
The tastes reflect the nose and fit very nicely into the style. There is a lot of nicely blended sweetness and alcohol with some rich, sherry-like tastes. Smooths out pretty well and the alcohol drinks lower than the 9.4% quoted. Not harsh, well constructed and balanced.
Very nice example of the style, and the beer comes together nicely. Not spectacular but I'm pleased to see a beer that is well put together and within some simle style parameters.
Pricey, and strictly speaking a one-off for me, but nevertheless glad I tried it."
Church Brew Works,Pipe Organ Pale Ale,,,English Pale Ale,4.30%,bottle,2.25,2,3,2,2.5,2,5/26/2010,"12 oz bottle as part of my Secret Bunny package from PittBeerGirl - thanks Sara.
Pour gives are very surprisingly dark, copper pour with a really poor head and no lace or retention.
Nose seems somewhat neutral but certainly no offensive. Light sweetness.
This is a bit of an odd beer. The beer is a very neutral, frankly fairly tasteless affair and very bland. However, the finish and aftertaste is EXTRAORDINARILY bitter and metallic, in a nasty lingering way too. Very unpleasant.
Not good and the second half of the bottle goes down the drain."
Southampton Publick House,Southampton Keller Pils,,,German Pilsener,5.00%,bottle,4.05,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,5/25/2010,"12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour is a slightly clouded, lemon colored body with a rocky, if not dense head, sitting on top. Not much retention or lace.
Nose gives a nice grassy, hoppy note.
Tastes are really quite bitter up front (and in the finish), but in between there is a lovely balance and beautiful, creamy mouthfeel. Rounded with some sweet notes in the middle. Lingering bite at the end. Slightly metallic ending as well.
VERY tasty and highly drinkable with a good, crisp thirst quenching note."
Abita Brewing Co.,Abita Select Weizenbock,,,Weizenbock,8.00%,on-tap,3.98,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,5/22/2010,"Lovely, another Abita Select and to be honest after some initial scepticism on my part I've been increasingly pleased with some of their efforts. It seems as though most Taco Mac's in the Atlanta area have installed a permanent Abita Select tap; even the Douglasville one where this was consumed.
Pour is the requisite, caramel colored, hazed affair with some pretty good head, lace and retention.
Nose is important for this style and the beer does not disappoint. Good pineapple, bubble-gum, candy and banana notes.
The tastes are slightly weaker than the nose and don't quite reach the zenith that the initial aroma would suggest. The body, although by no means weak, is also a touch light for the style but still decent with a little syrup note. Drinks very easily and alcohol seems solid if not overpowering.
Pretty good example of the style where the only question appears over the mouthfeel. Otherwise solid and a pleasing beer."
Victory Brewing Company,Baltic Thunder,,,Baltic Porter,8.50%,bottle,4.65,4,5,5,3,4.5,5/22/2010,"22 oz bottle that I bought way back when it came to GA for the first time. The bottle has a white, dot-matrixed date that says, Best Before Dec 31 08. Deliberately held on to this for aging purposes.
Pour is a classic, dark brown, black, ruby red combo. The head is good to start, but fades badly to leave little retention and no lace.
The nose is AMAZING. An extraordinary, beautiful, slightly oxidized Madeira fruit, alcohol and boozy, liquor note. Lots of sherry notes.
Taste replicate the massive liquor note and a light hint of smoke. Some alcohol that is sharp but seems in line with what is appropriate. Delicious sweetness associated with a dark fruit, fig-based note that is reminiscent of the finest, dark Belgians. Moreish and slightly drying in the finish. Sherry comes again.
The only problem here is NOT the fault of the beer, but as an aged beer it has lost the mouthfeel, body and carbonation. I like my Baltic Porters to have some life, and the gain in beautiful oxidation notes has come with a price, but that's my fault for aging it. Mea culpa."
"Lao Brewery Co., Ltd",Beerlao Dark,,,Euro Dark Lager,6.50%,bottle,3.18,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,5/21/2010,"Single from Camp Creek Beverage, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour gives a mid-brown body with a good degree of clarity and an impressive, high, white head. Not a great deal of lace but decent to look at.
Nose and tastes give that typical, sweet, malty slightly watery feel that also has a note of cocoa powder about it. Alcohol is well-hidden. Maybe some light apples amongst the malts and light flavors?
Some acid like bitterness in the finish. Aftertaste lingers a touch and is a wee bit astringent to boot.
Pretty much as expected, in fact it could have been much worse."
Saint Arnold Brewing Company,Saint Arnold Divine Reserve #8,,,Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy,9.30%,bottle,2.55,2.5,3,2.5,3,2,5/21/2010,"12 oz bottle into the Sam Adams perfect pint glass.
Body is a ugly, clouded, Dubbel-like affair with very little discernible head, retention or lace.
Nose has quite a lot of sweet peat, and then this is followed-up a LOT in the taste. Unfortunately the combination of light smoke (good), peat (also good) with an overwhelming sweetness gives a syrupy, difficult to drink cough medicine effect. The alcohol is also prominent and the combination gets way too much very quickly.
Even with this level of age the beer still seems ridiculously hot and gives a nasty burn on the way down. It's still a bit solvent like even after this time.
I just don't get a beer like this. By all means give the peat and smoke notes as big features, but why then bother with alcohol up near double digits? It just doesn't work well as a combination, and the kitchen sink approach here lets the beer down. What's wrong with a bit of balance or restraint?"
Brasserie Dubuisson Frères sprl,Bush Blonde,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,10.50%,bottle,3.2,4,3,3,3.5,3.5,5/20/2010,"750 mL corked & caged bottle from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Opens with an alarming, large pop with lots of gun smoke. The pour into the Duvel tulip yields a darker than expected, orange colored body with a pretty good head and some really nice lace.
This is a confusing beer since it also has the word ""Tripel"" on the label (along with Blonde). It's really quite a sweet beer than lacks any kind of white pepper notes or spice. The beer is really quite bland in many respects and lacks even an alcohol edge in the taste. Plenty of honey. It's a little slick in the mouth. A bit muddy and lacks much definition at all.
Ultimately a slightly disappointing beer for me which fails to hit many of the expected notes."
Weyerbacher Brewing Co.,Tiny,,,American Double / Imperial Stout,11.80%,bottle,4.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,5/20/2010,"750 mL corked & caged affair from Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour is a jet black pour with a khaki colored, fine-bubbled head that forms with a pretty good definition.
Nose and tastes definitely have some decent dark fruits, a touch of alcohol and plenty of Belgian yeast notes which are pleasing to me. It IS true that the beer treads a fine line between a traditional Belgian Dark and a Stout (with the stout winning more often than not), but there is sufficient Belgian character to keep me interested. Finish is a little darker with some smoke and slightly bitter character that I could do without, but nevertheless it still works for me. Some dark fruits in there but the Belgian character is first followed by a drier, stout-like back end. Bitterness builds a little down the bottle and in the finish.
It's a bit like a cross between Unibroue Trois Pistoles and a light, American RIS. The fact that it says ""Belgian Style Imperial Stout"" on the label therefore seems very appropriate.
Considering the ABV, it's very well hidden and pretty drinkable. Tasty, and easy to drink when you consider the overall package."
Oskar Blues Grill & Brewery,GUBNA Imperial IPA,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,10.00%,can,3.85,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,5/18/2010,"Resisted the temptation to buy a $15+ four pack of this for a few weeks and went with a single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
12 oz can, the usual OB presentation.
Can cracks with a somewhat disappointing (but expected) lack of pop, but given the ABV this is acceptable. 
Pretty nice looking golden body with some frothy, loose white head. Even a little lace. lowish carbonation on the pour.
Nose is a light hoppy, musty aroma but not an especially aggressive one. Reminds me of a relatively restrained IPA or simple pale ale. Surprisingly light.
Alcohol warms one a touch, but again it is well hidden and quite understated. A little of the light onion that some others have mentioned, but nowhere near the amount that I was anticipated from some other comments. A little dryness and bittering in the finish, but considering the style it's all in check. Finish adds some citrus rind and the beer cuts a pretty clean swathe across the palate - AGAIN surprising for the style.
I must admit I was ready NOT to like this, but it was actually MUCH better than I was expecting and I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. I was extremely surprised at how low-key the overall package was given the ABV and the style; it drank well below some of the usual parameters for the combo."
Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),LongShot Lemon Pepper Saison,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,6.40%,bottle,3.73,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,5/16/2010,"12 oz single as part of the Longshot sixer. Green's on Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Crystal clear, lemon-yellow color. Head is good initially but fades quickly with poor retention but conversely leaves some nice, sticky lace.
Mild, earthy funk in the nose but it's pretty light, simple and not big at all.
Tastes are where there is a touch more lemon citrus than the nose would suggest. Nice creamy balance is in the mouth and the beer comes together well. Some nice round malts. There is an interesting combo of white pepper and sweeter vanilla tastes that come together in the middle of the beer. Finishes with some citrus acidity.
Pretty nice, enjoyable beer but not something that I think I would want much of. ABV is fine, but restricts my intake despite the ease of consumption."
New Belgium Brewing,Skinny Dip,,,American Blonde Ale,4.20%,bottle,2.73,4,3,2.5,4,2,5/16/2010,"12 oz single, Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Clear, honey golden pour with a decent frothy head.
Nose has some acidic malts, but not much else.
Tastes are very neutral to me. High level of carbonation gives a mineral like, sodium hydrogencarbonate taste as if I was drinking an antacid. The mineral base and large carbonation does give a lively mouthfeel which I like. Finish leaves a touch of bitterness and more of the lingering dissolved salts.
Very odd beer for me and I can't get past the odd, dissolved salt effect. It's what I would imagine a numbers of alkali metal salts would taste like give they were put into solution and then slightly carbonated.
Like the ABV, don't like the beer."
O'Dempsey's LLC,Big Red Ale,,,Irish Red Ale,6.00%,bottle,3.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,5/16/2010,"12 oz single, Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Very good color on the pour with a lovely, dark red/mahogany color and a nice head that has a toffee colored hue. Not much retention or lace.
Carbonation produces some streaming bubbles.
Nose has a bunch of quite seriously sweet malts.
The tastes highlight and showcase the malts even more than the nose would suggest. The beer is really quite sweet and lacks much of a typical dry finish that is often associated with the style. As the beer warms and as I drink more, the sweetness seems to subside to give more bitterness, but the beer never gets aggressive.
Well, not much to report here, but a nice beer that I could drink a couple of without too much trouble."
Red Brick Brewing Company,Red Brick Brown Ale,,,American Brown Ale,6.00%,bottle,3.05,3,3,3,3.5,3,5/16/2010,"12 oz single.
What? I've never reviewed this? Seems unlikely, but here we go.
Pour is quite a light, orange color that one would perhaps associate more with an IPA rather than a brown. Head is decent, but retention is not great. Lace is present, but fairly wispy and not especially sticky.
Large caramel malts with also a (apparently odd) bourbon note! WTF? Anyway, in the taste the beer gets back to being ""normal"" with extra malt caramel and some rounded sweetness. A little touch of smoke for me (which again seems odd), but it meshes nicely.
The mouthfeel is VERY light for the style, and I guess one can view this either way. On one hand one might say that this adds to the drinkability, but on the other you could say that it makes the beer a bit weak for the style - I tend to go with the later. In the finish, that strange bourbon note pops up again in the aftertaste!
Frankly this is not a great beer and I generally don't drink this often, even though it is right on my doorstep."
Yards Brewing Co.,India Pale Ale,,,English India Pale Ale (IPA),7.00%,bottle,3.48,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,5/16/2010,"12 oz single, from PittBeerGirl as part of my secret bunny 2010.
Nice, authentic orange body with a good head initially but it fades pretty quickly. Not much lace either.
Light hops in the nose that are replicated with more force in the tastes. Quite sweet, so lots of malts must back up the hop profile. The alcohol is very well hidden and would not have guessed this was 7.00%. The finish also has some residual sugar. The malt base, the relatively low alcohol taste and the sweetness, certainly add up to this beer being on the English end of the spectrum.
Mid level carbonation is appropriate.
A little soap taste buils in the finish along with some acidity and a little grapefruit."
Brewery Ommegang,Tripel Perfection,,,Tripel,8.90%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,5/15/2010,"The usual, 750 mL presentation with cork & cage from Ommegang. Purchased from Green's on Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Decent pop on opening with some gunsmoke. 
Body is quite a dark orange considering the style. Head is decent, but fades to a collar and some spotty surface note with no lace on standing.
A high level of Belgian yest in the nose.
More yeast are the initial tastes. Plenty of alcohol and it warms slightly. Also the requisite white pepper but the alcohol comes back (along with the yeast) time and time again. Quite aggressive and upfront in terms of alcohol.
I guess there is a little honey as well, along with a dry, slightly bitter, short ending. Very light spice.
Tasty and just about what I expected from Ommegang. They seldom make mistakes and generally produce a high quality beer that fits style parameters well. This is no exception."
Elevator Brewery & Draught Haus,Elevator Bleeding Buckeye Red Ale,,,Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB),5.70%,bottle,2.83,2.5,3,3,2.5,2.5,5/14/2010,"12 oz bottle from my recent Columbus, OH trip.
Nice color on the pour, but the beer lacks life. The red highlights and general bright body and clarity are encouraging, but then the lack of carbonation, head, lace and retention let the beer down.
Some light malts in the nose and not much else.
The beer delivers a decent malt punch and a little too much dry character that I really don't want in the style. The beer fades quite quickly and is easily forgotten. Decent malt tastes for the style with some dry notes that DO define it, but the lack of life lets me down. This would be a better beer if it were trying to be an American Red; as an ""English"" ESB it's seriously lacking.
A beer that is lost in the sea of average craft beers and would need to step up quite a few notches before I could imagine me ranking this in a manner that would mean I would seek it again."
Erie Brewing Co.,Golden Fleece Maibock,,,Maibock / Helles Bock,8.50%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,5/14/2010,"I love a good bock and was delighted to get this as part of my Easter Bunny package from PittBeerGirl - thanks!
12 oz single.
Pretty much a quintessential American example of the style for me. Nice golden color with a decent head and some good retention and lace. In addition we get a nice golden color (important for the style), and a decent alcohol warmth that does not get in the way of drinkability. Now of course, the beer does creep up on you come the end of the bottle so the alcohol is still a feature.
Nice malts compete for your attention all the way through the beer. There is a touch of bitterness in the finish but the malts dominate in keeping with the style. A nice sweet and sour combo guide the beer. As i say above, the alcohol builds but it still remains very tasty and moreish. Good stuff, I'd happily drink this again."
Spoetzl Brewery,Shiner 101 Czech Style Pilsner,,,Czech Pilsener,4.60%,bottle,3.1,4,3,3,3.5,3,5/14/2010,"12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour is a golden color with a frothy, light head that although not especially well-retained it does produce some significant lace.
Nose and tastes create a feel of a Pils without the true Saaz-like kick in the back end. Some light, white pepper that for a second seems like we have a Belgian Pale note, but it fades and the bitterness does not figure.
Relatively light and easy drinking, but a beer that ultimately seems fairly pedestrian. Grassy notes are missing and beer lacks a certain crispness for me. Seems a bit lightweight all around to me.
I'd be happy to drink a few at a summer gathering but beyond that I'm not reaching much for that."
Harpoon Brewery,Harpoon Single Hop ESB (100 Barrel Series #31),,,Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB),5.80%,bottle,2.98,3.5,2.5,3,3.5,3,5/12/2010,"OK, it's not brewed in England and it's NOT a cask offering, and I could still be happy if it was taken down another 0.5% on the ABV, BUT, on the face of it this at least has the potential to help me out in my desperate and generally futile search for high quality ESB's in the USA.
Let's see.
Nice authentic color in the body with a deep, orange/amber hue. Head size is especially disappointing to me and the retention and lace should also be better for a beer of this ABV.
Nose reveals little, with a touch of fruit perhaps and some general, malty sweetness.
The tastes are too hoppy for the style IMO, and the bitterness certainly outstrips the nose in terms of what one might expect from the beers' aroma. Some fruit upfront with a hint oif traditional biscuit malts and also a pleasing (and surprising) soapy nature - that was especially pleasing. However, the fruit soon gives way to the finish which lingers and is quite a grapefruit centered, bitter affair. Also unfortunately, the beer has a bitterness that builds which is NOT what I want in the style, in fact I really rather want the opposite. This subtracts substantially from the drinkability for me.
Not a bad effort, but I'm almost completely resigned to the whole, ""high quality ESB"" thing not ever happening in the US."
Flying Dog Brewery,Raging Bitch Belgian-Style IPA,,,Belgian IPA,8.30%,bottle,3.23,3,3,3.5,3,3,5/10/2010,"12 oz bottle. Not quite sure why this did not/has not made it to GA, perhaps it HAS but I've not been looking for it. Was it in the Canis Major mixed pack? Anyway...
Hazy, orange body with low to mid-carbonation and a little head and some retention. Not much lace at all.
Nose offers some light hop character, a bit of sweetness and perhaps a touch of Belgian yeast.
Tastes are reminiscent of the nose, but crank some of the aspects up quite a lot. The sweetness comes first, followed by the yeast and finally a really direct and assertive metallic bitterness comes in. The beer feels a bit too thin for me, and there are several examples of this style give much deeper (And better) interpretations for me. There are are some citrus fruit peel and zest notes with some orange, lemon and grapefruit influences.
In the end I didn't find this especially interesting. One and done here."

I've been pretty pleased with a number of the recent Fort Collins offerings, and it is my suspicion that they don't quite get the respect that they deserve.
Beautiful, bright copper colored body with some wispy head that fades quickly. Not surprising given the ABV. Little or no lace. Color is attractive.
Malty alcohol in the nose, not much else.
Medium carbonation greets the mouth.
The tastes are alcohol based with malty intentions but ultimately the beer drinks much like a toned down American Barleywine. It's nowhere near sweet enough to be considered an English version of the style, but on the other hand it's also significantly less aggressive in the bitterness/hop category to be condsidered an American Barleywine. Some of the other wheat wines I have had managed to distinguish themsleves as a seriously different animal in terms of style - this one does not do that, and it seems just like a very strong beer without much defining character or style.
More sweetness in the finish that makes the beer a little more mellow than the ABV might otherwise suggest.
Not the best beer form FCB; I've been happier with other things that they have done."

The pour into the Terrapin snifter and gives quite a still body with a light, copper color with obviously no head or lace. Ultimately it looks like a brandy in the glass.
The nose has some alcohol but there is a feeling that the light solvent effect is mainly in the nostrils rather than the taste. A little acidic apple in the nose as it warms.
The taste is extraordinary in as much as the alcohol is enormously well hidden and there is none of the expected alcohol burn. In that respect the ABV on the bottle seems incredulous.
The tastes are sweet and smokey with an element of light tangerine. It's really quite amazing in its unique nature. VERY odd but I like it. Dry finish which is the way in which the alcohol manifests itself. The smokey, dry effect builds but it seems amazingly in check. More light fruit soaked in alcohol.
This is a CRAZY beer which I don't really understand at all. It delivers a bunch of gentle and subtle character but also comes in a 10.5%! Weird.
One of the most interesting beers that I've tasted in some time. I'm not 100% sure where it sits with me, but it's got me thinking. Not sure if that was Dan's intention but that's what's occurring."
Mikkeller,1000 IBU,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,9.60%,bottle,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,2,5/7/2010,"375 mL bottle, corked (synthetic) & caged. Green glass, thick dimpled champagne-style bottom. Green's on Buford, around $10 for the bottle (I think).
Pour gives a murky brown color with a LOT of yeast floaties. Drab and dull in the mid-brown color. Quite unattractive, especially with the cascading floaties and the dirty dishwater appearance. Looks like a nasty, home-brewed, unfiltered Dubbel.
Smell is surprisingly non-hop based. Quite neutral without much hint of the tastes to come. Some sweetness.
Tastes are an offensive barrage of unsweetened grapefruit with the emphasis on the tartness rather than the bitterness.To be honest the beer did not drink as aggressively hop-tasting as I was expecting but it did have an astringent combination of sour notes amongst the hops. It is true that the hops did build down the glass. A little citrus based pine and a very unbalanced malt profile complete the picture - not good.
The beer quickly became very syrupy and thick in the mouth with a (literally) sticky feel around the glass where it had spilled.
Nasty stuff really and a silly beer with a silly name. Mikkeller seems to be falling into the style-over-substance trap increasingly."

Thanks to the wife for bringing this back from SC just a few days before ST hit GA - typical.
Pour is an obvious orange color, but the two things that strike me as particularly prevalent are the light cloudiness and the fact that the beer seems quite thin in appearance.
Nose and tastes are typical for the style with a combination of grapefruit, syrupy alcohol and sweet sugary notes. This is not any easy drink by an stretch of the imagination and the beer begins to wear on me after a pretty short time. Pretty typical for the style in as much as beer produces many aggressive elements that attack the senses but fails to satisfy me. Too much going on."
Three Floyds Brewing Co. / Brewery & Pub,Robert The Bruce Scottish Ale,,,Scottish Ale,6.50%,bottle,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,5/2/2010,"12 oz single.
Had this a couple of times before, just getting around to reviewing it now.
Color is a beautiful garnet pour with a real, red appearance and plenty of mahogany highlights. Body is great, BUT unfortunately the head is poor and consequently there is little retention or lace. That's a shame.
Malt based is an understatement of course, but the beer also imparts a little hop bite in the finish and some alcohol presence. Finish has a touch more alcohol mixed in with the warm malts and even has a little burn.
Very malty and drinkable, the beer creates some warmth and drinks easily but I feel this is better suited to the colder months."
Clown Shoes,Brown Angel,,,American Brown Ale,7.00%,bottle,3.33,4,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,5/1/2010,"Massive thanks go out to Gregg for the opportunity to try this. Delighted to have the chance, and also humbled by his generosity.
22 oz bottle - silly label that does no favors for craft beer. (I agree with the Bros. comments in the mag about this).
Pour is an attractive, deep chestnut brown with some red highlights. Head is a mocha color with some decent retention and a little wispy lace.
Nose has the expected (but unwanted), fresh green hop note. Not much to say other than I don't want it, and it masks all of the malt notes and sweet nutty character that a brown ale should have.
Tastes reflect the nose, BUT the hop profile does NOT screw-up the sweet malts and nuttiness to the extent that the nose would suggest. In that respect it was better than I expected, although the green hop presence still takes much of the joy of the brown ale style away for me. The finish has a bakers chocolate/cocoa dry finish which I enjoyed.
Overall the beer is NOT the worst example of an American Brown Ale that I've had, BUT of course I really don't want significant hop features making all the good stuff (malts, sweetness and nut character) that I want in my browns. As such obviously my review is not especially objective so take it or leave it. However, as expected, not my cup of tea."
Gordon Biersch Brewery Restaurant,Gordon Biersch Blonde Bock,,,Bock,7.00%,bottle,3.98,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,5/1/2010,"Very happy to see GB bottle their beers now, as I have always felt that they are generally under-rated and get a bad rap when in fact they make some half decent beer. Not stellar, but decent, especially in one or two, specific, German style areas.
Blonde Bock six pack from my local Publix supermarket, $8.99.
Pour is a golden body with a nice head that forms quickly. Sadly the head is poorly retained and there is a little lace.
Sweet malt nose with some alcohol and some pale malts. The tastes reflect the nose and there is some decent viscosity about the mouthfeel, almost as if the beer is a lot higher in ABV. A good Bock will always give you a slightly syrupy note and an alcohol presence that definitely holds its own, and this is no exception. Some light apples and acidity upfront and a crisp finish put together a pretty nice, thirst quenching package that drinks every bit of its 7%. It has a moreish, malty sweetness that sits nicely with me.
I like this beer in small quantities, as a lot of it seems like it might accumulate some sugar and give a nasty hangover.
I think GB deserves a bit more credit than they get, and I for one will be buying their beers again."

Water like pour with a only hints of color, carbonation, head , lace or retention.
Carbonation seems higher than the appearance would suggest.
Grains and pale malt dominate the tastes and aroma and the beer drinks much like a pale seltzer water.
Aggressive burps suggest the carbonation IS indeed, high.
Pretty much as expected."

Pour as expected, gives a nasty looking, macro urine color with plenty of trapped, large bubbles. Head is very fluffy and light, but has little or no retention but does give surprisingly good, sticky lace on the glass.
Nose gives a neutral, light corn note and little else.
Tastes are bland and lack any kind of real, Saaz-like Pils bite - then again, I wasn't exactly expecting much! Finishes with a lingering, bitter aftertaste and some residual sugary sweetness.
Pretty poor, and largely in-line with expectations."
Rogue Brewery (Brewer's on the Bay),Chatoe Rogue First Growth Single Malt Ale,,,American Blonde Ale,?,bottle,3.08,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,5/1/2010,"Simplicity on the pour with a nice, orange body hat sits underneath the white head. Some lace, but not much to speak of and the head fades rather quickly.
Nose has plenty of grain character but the threat of extra hop presence also wafts into the nostrils. The tastes confirm that exact combo with the hops taking too forward a role for me (at least in terms of the style).
Finis is interesting since it imparts a fairly significant dry, cracker like ending that I wasn't expecting and again seems a little out of style.
In the end this is like a LOT of Rogue beers in as much as it ultimately just seems over-hopped to me. Don't get me wrong, this is not a ""hoppy"" beer as such, but it always seems the same with Rogue, that is the malts take a backseat in places they should be more to the fore.

Saint Arnold Brewing Company,Saint Arnold Divine Reserve #6,,,American Barleywine,10.00%,bottle,3.33,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,5/1/2010,"12 oz single.
Well, if nothing else, true to style.
The beer gives a rather unattractive, murky brown body similar to a Dubbel in appearance with little or no head, retention or lace. The head situation is to be expected given the ABV, but the body is somewhat drab and uninspiring.
The brew exhibits all of the classic American Barleywine characteristics along with the way that one normally expects them to change over time. Plenty of slightly faded, hop forward aggression with little malt backbone to hold them up; a lot of hop bitterness and plenty of alcohol still present to drive the whole beer deep into the palate. Nothing subtle about this beer, even after the time that the cellar has given it. The hops have faded some, but it's all relative.
This is pretty much a quintessential beer in the style, but not one that I care for very much."

22 oz bottle in the usual screen printed ST style.
Pour is a beautiful, golden clear body with a smashing white head that gives some nice sticky lace - decent retention considering the ABV of the beer. Looks nice, especially the depth of color.
Nose is plenty of sweet alcohol (and not much else) and this is exactly how the taste manifests itself. This is not a subtle beer, but with a serious decrease in ABV it could be a delicious one. All of the elements are there with a smooth look and a nice body, and also some good, solid malt bases, but the alcohol is just abusive after about half of the bottle. For me it's too much and the solvent aspect of the beer overwhelms all the good stuff. Syrupy mouthfeel.
Close, but no cigar on this one for me. Perhaps as a six percent beer this would hit it, but for now it feels too fusel for me. A bit ""rough"", and gave me the feeling of a high gravity, malt liquor and not in a good way."

Lovely, beautifully carbonated, golden yellow pour with a pillow-like, fluffy head that gives some nice lace. The beer is very lively and adds a certain anticipation of the taste. Looks great.
Light citrus nose but this all but disappears when the true nature of the style cuts in quickly with some severe bitterness. Clean though, so the marriage is a good one.
Finishes crisp and somewhat dry but has a lingering malt ""effect"" at the far back end. Perhaps some tart, hard fruit especially reminiscent of gooseberries.
Tasty and full of flavor but the bitterness caught me a little by surprise. Almost a Saaz, pils like bite in the ending. interesting beer that I would like to try along side some from Cologne."

750 mL, plastic (don't like that) corked, caged and foiled. VERY difficult to get the cork out - annoying. Getting the cork out produces a weak pop - disappointing.
Disappointingly dark pour, with an amber hue. Head is also weak and leaves watery lace. No retention.
Nose yields a little funk but a confusing, and unexpected sweet caramel note. The sweetness increases dramatically over time and the tiny funk recedes as the beer warms. 
The tastes are also caramel influenced with some sweet yeasts. I don't get this beer; it says ""Belgian Wild"" on the label and is categorized here as a Pale, it's all very confusing. It has some biscuit malts and caramel that reminds me of an English beer, a tiny bit of funk and some Belgian yeast character. What the hell they were trying to pull together here I have no idea.

Nice pop on opening, a little gun smoke.
Pour yields a standard, yellowish body with a wispy, light head. The head lacks some depth and the body seems a little on the thin side. I anticipated this a bit, and though that the second pour and/or agitation of some sediment might change things but alas, nothing. Very disappointing in terms of depth of body in the look, taste and mouthfeel.
All of the classic ingredients for a good Wit are there with the light spice, herbal notes and a touch of citrus, but the beer fails quite badly in the mouthfeel and body department and comes across as somewhat watery.
This simply doesn't quite get above average, and with so much competition in the market place it;s unlikely to get my support again in the near future."

Small pop on opening, not huge, but nevertheless there is some carbonation - always a slight concern with Lost Abbey.
Pour is as expected with a dense, slightly off-white head that has pillow-like character and a hazy, orange/golden body. Solid looking.
Nose and tastes combine in a rather unusual way to bring the best of Belgium with that, typical slightly over-hopped American influence. Tangy orange, light yeasty spice and then a sprinkling of bitterness thrown in for good measure. Belgian IPA-esque I suppose.
It's really a competition between the yeast notes that one expects in a range of Belgian based beers like Saison's, Farmhouses and Pale Ales, and the West Coast, American hop influence which undoes some of that good work. To me, I don't feel as though the two complement one another, and in the final analysis I think I'd prefer beer that firmly came down in one area or the other.
Having said that, if you good into the beer knowing that it will be hopped more than a tradition beer of the style, I suppose it won't be too disappointing, however, don't look for a classic in the style here, you won't find it."
Church Brew Works,Quadzilla (Cherry Quad),,,Quadrupel (Quad),10.30%,bottle,3.88,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,4/22/2010,"Many thanks to PittBeerGirl for the chance to try this one as part of Secret Bunny 2010 - thanks Sara.
750 mL capped bottle with white foil on the neck, not gold as in the BA db picture.
Pour is a surprisingly light, cloudy, orange color that is reminiscent of tea. I was expecting a dark, black cheery color which would fit with the advertised fruit and the quad categorization. Not much head and little or no retention.
Nose gives some fruity notes, but they are not strong and definitely not obviously cherry based.
The color confused me a little as it was not remotely dark enough to be considered typically quad-like. The tastes are also VERY fruity (although virtually zero discernible cherry) and reminiscent of a triple. The alcohol is present but not especially strong and again is triple like. There are some pears and light pineapple which again point to triple, not quad.
I guess what I'm saying is two things. Firstly this is essentially a triple, and secondly it has almost zero discernible cherry flavors, but IS very fruity.
Tasty, relatively well hidden alcohol and highly drinkable, this is a nice beer but to be honest I just can't see it as being a quad by any stretch of the imagination."
Clown Shoes,Hoppy Feet (Black I.P.A.),,,American Black Ale,7.00%,bottle,2.8,4.5,3,2.5,4.5,2,4/18/2010,"OK, big props to Gregg for taking the time and the trouble to hook me up. I truly appreciate the gesture.
Firstly, the style or name ""Black IPA"" is ludicrous and I am glad that American Brewers Association agrees with me and calls this type of beer, ""American-Style India Black Ale""! Anyway, back to this particular ASIBA!
Pour is a dark, dark chestnut (bordering on black) brown body with a lovely, creamy, thick mocha head. A few orange/red highlights at the extremities which are enhanced by the tapered glass that the beer sits in. An encouraging, ""noisy"" pour which suggests good body and creamy depth. Decent head retention and some above average lace. Looks great; so far, so good. 
Nose reveals some deep, resinous pine, and as is usual with the style this starts to confuse the senses as the eyes see one thing and the nose sees another - I don't like the confusion, but that is not a function of this particular beer rather a problem with the style in general.
Initial tastes reflect the pine nose, but this beer changes quite significantly as it warms. The malts really do come into their own and there is even a hint of chocolate that comes to the fore to compete with the hop bill. A little roastiness as one would expect with a licorice hint. For me the hops are simply way too aggressive and although they are tempered in the middle of the beer, they come back to haunt the aftertaste in a very, very aggressive manner. The aftertaste is bitingly bitter, and not in a good way. Alcohol is well-hidden. I'm just not sure that this malt bill can hold up the resin-based hop profile.
The mouthfeel is that of a classy brown ale, with great depth and a lovely creamy texture, however all of that good work is undone by the astringent bitterness that bites back over and over again. Along with the look, the mouthfeel is definitely the beers' strongest point, but because of the unsubtle bitterness the drinkability is really pretty low for me.
I dunno, this is an extremely difficult style for me to get into and my review WILL reflect my general dislike of the combination rather than (necessarily) that of this particular beer, however I'm always upfront in saying that my reviews are not 100% ""to style"" and have my own preferences and subjectivity built in, so you can take it for what it's worth. To be fair, I disliked this beer much less than some others I have had in the same style so I suppose you could call it a triumph in that respect!
I would imagine if you can stand the (what seems to me) unbalanced bitterness, and you enjoy this style you might really like this beer, but for me it's a bit of a non-starter in terms of actually sitting down and drinking it. This would be so much better off if it were tweaked to be a straight up brown ale of even a porter. I understand that would negate the whole point, but nevertheless that's what I leave with at the end of the bottle."

Impressive presentation. Pour yields a hazed orange body with wispy head. Darker than expected. Retention and lace are not huge, but are sufficient.
Nose has an acidic, citrus twang with a touch of mild funk and an organic feel. 
Light carbonation dances on the tongue to give a lively presence. Acidity is quite large but in keeping with the style. A bright, lemon and soap taste combines to give a heavier feel than one expects from the style. A little more hop character than I was anticipating....""American Style"". Good depth on the mouthfeel.
Alcohol is present and the beer is quite viscous for the style.
Very tasty, but not a simple, easy drinking Saison, and not ""light"". I guess that's to be expected. More hop character than I wanted or needed but still holds up well. I'm not sure that my score represents how much I really like this, but..."
Brewery Ommegang,Ommegang BPA (Belgian-style Pale Ale),,,Belgian Pale Ale,6.20%,bottle,3.98,3.5,4,4,4,4,4/11/2010,"VERY excited to try any new Ommegang beer and the fact that this is pitched in the way it is (as a somewhat potential ""single"" or ""simple"" Belgian Ale) makes me even more interested.
750 mL, corked & caged, packaged on 01/19/10, Best By 01/2011.
Color on the pour into the Duvel tulip is a little darker and more orange than I was expecting. Head is not well retained and fades to a thin film on the beer and some scant lace. A little disappointed in the color, I wanted something lighter.
Nose offers up some serious yeast and some simple, grape like aromas. 
The initial tastes enhance the fruit and the beer comes through as sweet which denies the ""Dry Hopped"" text on the label. A LOT of pineapple and other sweet tropical fruit come through as well, but the finish is surprisingly dry considering the nose and sweet fruit angle that hits the palate initially.
It's a little confusing to me as to what a ""Belgian Pale Ale"" is. Is it a Belgian Simple, or single, is it a watered down Belgian IPA, is it an American version of a Belgian Ale? Dunno.
Confusing beer that is solid and drinkable but I'm not really sure what Ommegang was reaching for here. I'd like to hear more from the brewers on this one."
COAST Brewing Company,Boy King Double IPA,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,9.50%,growler,4.33,4.5,5,4,4,4.5,4/10/2010,"OK, here we go with the much vaunted Boy King from COAST. I got really lucky as my wife was in Hilton Head when the Boy King was tapped at The Lodge - one growler = $19.
Growler opens with a pleasing ""phhssst"" which gives me confidence - you never know how well the growler was filled or how it will hold up over a couple of days. This one seems perfect.
The nose up front is really quite strong with a hop-laden tangerine citrus coming to the fore. The aroma is pretty interesting because as the beer warms a little the fruit intensifies but the smell seems to become increasingly malty and less hop-dominant.
A hazed and clouded amber/orange with degrees of color down the tapered glass, the beer has an Olde English Marmalade look about it in terms of hue. Head is light but full, leaves excellent lace, and has nice retention but is less ""sticky"" that some DIPA froths.
EXTREMELY well balanced with a malt presence and backbone which MUST be one of the largest ever encountered in an American DIPA. Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of west coast style resin and pine in the middle and back-end of the beer, but the start is very, very malty for the style and this rounds out the aftertaste too - very unusual and subtle aftertaste for something in this style. Mild bitterness but not palate wrenching. There's even a touch of unsweetened bubblegum in there!
Extremely drinkable, and although I wouldn't say that the alcohol is nowhere to be seen, I would say that it is quite subtle and very understated in terms of the taste. It does not manifest itself in the 9.5% range! As a result, take care, this beer could clearly sneak up on you and bite you pretty hard.
I score this beer pretty highly, BUT this is really interesting because if you are a SERIOUS hop-head I don't think that this will quite cut it for you. In that respect it's an interesting DIPA and a beer that will appeal to those of us that like a hop blast but still demand balance. Some American drinkers shun such balance so, in time, we should get some mixed reviews on this one. I'll be watching with interest."
Jailhouse Brewing Company,Breakout Stout,,,American Stout,7.80%,on-tap,4.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,4/8/2010,"Drunk at the brewery just a few days after the first batch was brewed. (This was brewed for the first time in April 2010, but will eventually become a winter seasonal according to JBC).
Classic, black pour with a few reddish highlights in the strong light. Head is thick, well formed, offers excellent retention and some nice lace. Creamy head.
The nose gives a distinct oatmeal aroma (even though the beer is NOT an Oatmeal Stout) - Glenn (the brewer), suggested that this could be due to the flaked grain that was present in the beer. Unfiltered to protect the roasted flavors from being diluted (again according to Glenn).
Light roast (to me there was virtually no coffee depsite the fact that Glenn suggested there may be), but with some really gentle and rounded fullness. Very non-aggressive (hooray) a really simple, well rounded and drinkable stout. Glenn said it weighs in at around 7% (I think).
Medium body with enough presence to make itself heard, but with plenty of light subtlety to make you want to come back for more.
A light touch on this beer without it ""being"" light. Very drinkable and a very nice beer all around."
Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Duvel Draft,,,Belgian Pale Ale,6.80%,on-tap,4.18,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,4/3/2010,"Having missed out on the first wave of this coming to Atlanta several months ago, I've managed to catch it about four times in the last few weeks - pleasing. On each occasion (The Fred, The Brick Store and Ormsby's) the beer was served in the Duvel Green glass.
Appearance is a nice golden clarity with a billowing head, but the whole package seems a lot flimisier than regular Duvel. Much wispier head, and talthough the lace is good the retention is not great. Well carbonation, even feeling a little ""fizzy"" at times.
Lots of dry, light spice which seems to dominate the sweetness a little more than I was expecting. Very light drinking, and it's a pity that the ABV isn't a few notches lower; if it were it would be more drinkable.
There's some light grassy notes (not exactly hop based but they do feel green) and nature to the beer too which added to the fresh, drinkability.
Impressed, and easily a beer that could become a springtime/summer favorite, but it probably won't be around for long so I'll get it whenever I can."
Minhas Craft Brewery,Simpler Times Lager,,,American Adjunct Lager,6.20%,can,2.53,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,4/3/2010,"12 oz, single can, Trader Joe's, Sandy Springs, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Golden body on the pour (nice) but with a seemingly very low carbonation. Head is quite big at first but fades badly to give no retention and no lace.
6.2% is an interesting level of alcohol as the beer drinks below that and with plenty of room for kicking back a few.
Simple is the watchword here with some mild cereal and quite a lot of sweetness.
Big fan of the can, so that's in its favor, but as expected this is very ordinary when it comes down to a beer analysis. Apart from the ABV I might categorize this as the quintessential American beer experience."
Abita Brewing Co.,Abita Select Double IPA,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,9.00%,on-tap,3.75,4,3,4,3.5,4,4/2/2010,"On tap at Taco Mac, Douglasville, GA, USA. Part of the Abita Select series that we now see in Atlanta.
Pour gives a golden body with a touch of chill-haze and some significant head,. The head retention is good and he lace that it produces is not insignificant. Good looking, but for some reason reminds me of a nitro pour - odd.
Sweet nose and tastes which reflect the style pretty well. Plenty of sweetness to back up the aggressive hops, this beer is surprisingly simple but good. Large hop presence in the finish and it provokes some nice burping - a good sign for me.
A little light in the mouth, but still performs well overall.
Definitely one of the best Abita offerings that I have had over the years so in the that respect it's good. As for an entry into the top echelon of American DIPA';s it still has some way to go but nevertheless kudos to Abita for continuing to work at this."
Boulevard Brewing Co.,Saison - Brett,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,8.50%,bottle,4.18,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,4/2/2010,"750 mL corked & caged bottle courtesy of PittBeerGirl as part of Secret Bunny 2010. Batch number 2009-1, bottle 00220 out of 11925. 
I loosened the cage on the bottle, turned around to get a glass of water and 30 seconds later the cork flew out and hit the kitchen ceiling. Good level of carbonation!
Beer gives a light orange, mid-butterscotch pour. HUGE head that sat there like an ice-cream. Super looking.
Nose is true to the description of a Saison with Brett, but quite mild. 
Tastes reflect the nose with a lemongrass note on top of the Brett and some more pronounced bitter, funk in the finish. Carbonation lingers for some time as well. Light mustard also makes an appearance with some timid acidity.
Mouthfeel is excellent and the beer is easy drinking.
Perhaps my expectations were a little too high, and although this is a very nice beer it never really broke through into stellar quality. All the same, a first class beer and one that I would always be more than delighted to drink."
"Cervezas Moritz, S.A.",Moritz,,,Euro Pale Lager,5.40%,can,3,3,3,3,3,3,4/2/2010,"Thanks go out to DogBrick for the chance to try this.
I suppose it depends on what you are looking for at any one particular juncture. If you want a macro-colored, well carbonated, sweet lager brew with some veggie highlights and some mild cereal, then this will fit the bill. Otherwise it will not work well for you.
Dark straw colored body with typically large initial carbonation that fades fast. No lace, poor retention. Nose and tastes are of the aforementioned mild, cereal sweetness and largely non-offensive.
I finished it quickly and without trouble, but that was because the beer fit the context nicely.
It is what it is, no more, no less."
Pivovar Náchod a.s.,Primátor Maibock,,,Maibock / Helles Bock,7.50%,bottle,4.25,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,4/2/2010,"$2.99 for the 500 mL bottle from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
The pour is a truly gorgeous golden color with good clarity and nice carbonation. Head is OK with some lace and a little retention. Color is really great.
Nose reveals very little other than lots of rich, deep malt.
Tastes reflect the nose but bring some dry character and a little alcohol. The dry character is quite a surprise by it merges well with the malts and produces quit a bit of depth. There seems to be some fruity notes amongst the other competing flavors and it drinks with a certain crispness which may be a function of the dry notes that come through.
A beer that comes with some decent character and intensity which was not what I was expecting. Good value too, especially for me in one of my favorite styles."
Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,30th Anniversary - Fritz And Ken's Ale,,,American Double / Imperial Stout,9.20%,bottle,3.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4/1/2010,"$9.99 Arbor Place Beverage, Douglasville, GA, USA.
Impressive pop from the unusually shaped bottle that is corked & caged. Some gunsmoke. Presentation is classy, including the label.
Pour is definitely intense-black with a large head at first but it fades away. Not much lace and a thin film is left on the surface. A little disappointing in the head department, but given the ABV not all that surprising. Having said that, I've seen similar strength stouts with much better retention and lace.
A little bit of roasty licorice in the nose but it's not that big. Surprisingly very little solvent alcohol - a good thing in my book.
Tastes reflect some of the light roast but there is a larger smoke element for me. The surprising thing is the manner in which the alcohol is hidden. Very little burn or presence. The roasty bitterness builds a little down the bottle and in the finish.
Well, at least it wasn't over-hopped! Outside of that a little too simple IMO for a signature event. Not a bad beer, but to be honest i was really expecting a LOT more. When SN gets out of AIPA mode they can sometimes struggle a little to define themselves."
Lagunitas Brewing Company,Wilco Tango Foxtrot,,,American Strong Ale,7.80%,bottle,2.85,4,2.5,3,3,2.5,3/28/2010,"22 oz bottle from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
(Potentially) excellent value for money as usual from Lagunitas, the usual presentation.
Pour is a very nice red-brown with nice clarity in the body. Off-white head that produces some sticky lace; retention not great. 
The nose has a surprising level of green hop presence. Really quite strong.
Tastes are a little mixed where the hops fade from their aroma level but still hang around, and then the malt bill kicks in. It still remains quite ""organic"" and green in its' feel. The beer definitely drinks MUCH more like an American Brown Ale than an American Strong to me, and that's my problem. I want Brown Ales to be sweet and malty and I don't like the hop presence to be high. It doesn't still all that well with me.
I don't like this beer very much as there is an odd, unhappy marriage of a beer that basically should have a low hop-profile, with a huge, green hop note - odd and unbalanced for me. It's NOT actually a very hoppy beer, but the combo just doesn't work for me."
The Porterhouse Brewing Company,Porterhouse Red,,,Irish Red Ale,4.40%,bottle,3.98,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,3/28/2010,"11.2 oz (330 mL) single from Hop City at $3.99. Pull tab cap - not very often you see those.
Great color and clarity on the pour, but let down by a disappointing head with poor retention and lace. The color is VERY red, and my guess is that this really is an Irish Red rather than an English Pale (as currently categorized in the BA database)...anyway...
Nose has some simple malts and the tastes are also very malt based with a dry finish. Hop profile is unsurprisingly low and the beer drink easily. Lots of complexity from the malt bill and a pleasingly simple beer that we see not nearly enough of in the US. What little hop character we do get comes with an English edge.
From the label:
Grain: Pale Malt, Crystal Malt, Wheat Malt, Chocolate malt
Hops: Galen, Nugget, East Kent Goldings."
Moa Brewing Company,Moa Original,,,German Pilsener,5.50%,bottle,3.23,3.5,3,3,4,3.5,3/27/2010,"It's been in Georgia for a few weeks now so I decided to take the plunge with one of the three Moa beers available here. All in 750's, all corked and caged and all $7.99. Reliably informed that these beers are bottle conditioned with champagne yeast. Opening the bottle backs that up with a BIG, impressive pop. Pour also suggests massive carbonation with an ice-cream, fine bubbled head on top of a murky, orange body. Looks good.
The head IS impressive but fades surprisingly quickly to give a complex but light, lace pattern.
Nose is a little grainy with some macro, adjunct characteristics. It seems like some highly carbonated malts.
Tastes are surprisingly neutral and although there is some bitterness, to say that this beer has any kind of noble, Saaz like hop bite would be a bit of a stretch and as such the German Pilsener moniker seems optimistic to me. Much more like a highly carbonated, Euro Lager in my book. Nevertheless, not really a problem as the beer drinks nicely with a simplicity and (the best part) a lively carbonation. A few earthy notes especially in the finish.
The carbonation is probably the best features and is enjoyable and perhaps hides some other shortcomings. I could see drinking this in large amounts at a summer wedding!
Without the carbonation a pretty ordinary beer, and not such of a Pils, however it was non-offensive and in the regard I didn't dislike the beer. Not bad value either."
Pretty Things Beer & Ale Project,Baby Tree,,,Quadrupel (Quad),9.00%,bottle,4.23,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,3/26/2010,"22 oz bottle thanks to Penney who brought this one back from The Foodery in Philly, PA, USA.
Mid brown body that sits nicely in the Brasserie de Abbaye des Rocs chalice with a lovely, frothy light tan head. Some lace.
Nose is surprisingly neutral to me (even with warming) and gives only the slightest hints of sweet malt, a touch of alcohol and some sharp carbonation (yes, carbonation in the nose!)
Taste start to reveal more of the dark fruit, BUT the taste remains quite distinctly ""unsweet"". A definite authenticity about the fruit, by that I mean it seems natural and NOT artificially sweetened. n that respect it seems quite different to a Belgian-grown version of the style. Also the alcohol is missing, in as much as it seems less boozy than many Quads.
The finish is very interesting to me. It gives a bitter note that is often missing in the sweeter, Belgian originals. For a moment it feels like almost a hoppy edge (which i feel would be out of place), but it pulls back from that particular edge and comes crashing in with the plum skins. Tannin and light, natural bitterness are very prominent which is an interesting touch. Almost a sweet and sour ending, but ultimately a pleasing, bitter dry edge.
A lovely beer, BUT be warned, the sweetness and the alcohol ARE muted for a typical Quadrupel. The good news is that those attributes are replaced with some authentic, bitterness from the dark fruit which seems like it emanates from the skins."
Terrapin Beer Company,Terrapin Capt'n Krunkles Black IPA,,,American Black Ale,7.50%,bottle,1.85,4.5,2,1.5,2.5,1.5,3/26/2010,"22 oz from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA. Gold foil on the neck as the remainder of the Side Project series, but reflects Depth Charge rather than the 1-9 side project label.
Pour is great looking, Inky black with a resplendent head that is thick and big with great retention and lace. The look is by far the best part of this beer - by a mile!
Nose is a hop based one but is light and reminds me of an anesthetic - think a visit to the dentist.
The tastes are nasty bitterness upon nasty bitterness. Not subtle and not roasted, rather it tastes like a piece of licorice that was constructed by a 10th graders chemistry set. Bitterness lingers and leaves a dry unhappiness in the mouth. Mouthfeel seems light and weak. 
Medicinal hops complete the package and the beer seems like a herbal mix of homebrew and vitamins.
It's a poor beer IMO."
"Anheuser-Busch, Inc.",Michelob DunkelWeisse,,,Dunkelweizen,5.50%,bottle,2.2,2,3,2,2,2,3/25/2010,"12 oz single, $1.19 from Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Glad to finally catch up with this beer. Oddly I have quite high expectations for it!
Pour is a murky, unattractive iced-tea like affair with a very poor head and as a resut little retention or lace. Body is an ugly, rust color that does not invite one in.
Carbonation is a little on the high side which gives the beer an off, fizzy sensation - again, not good.
Initially the tastes seem OK with some yeasty malts up front and some decent sweetness, but pretty soon it gets a bit acidic and thin. At first it seemed like this was going to drink something like a Gordon Biersch Marzen, but pretty quickly it declined into an acidic beer that gave me a little heartburn. In the end the sweet and sour effect did not save the beer and I was disappointed.
I thought this might have been better, but ultimately I guess I got sucked in. Not good."
Harpoon Brewery,Harpoon Crystal Wheat,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,4.80%,bottle,2.35,3,3,2,3,2,3/24/2010,"Filtered wheat beer in the 12 oz bottle as a single from Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA. $1.19.
The appearance is as expected with a decent head but little or no retention. Filtering means good clarity but somewhat lacking in character for me in its look.
Lemon is very strong for me. the label suggests a ""hint"" but to me it somewhat overwhelms the beer and it certainly does a number on the wheat aspect of the brew. For this reason i found the beer difficult to drink and wondered why they felt it necessary to drown the wheat, out.
Thirst quenching on a hot summer or spring day? Sure, but so are a billion and one other, better craft examples.
Not good for me."
Left Hand Brewing Company,400 Pound Monkey,,,English India Pale Ale (IPA),6.70%,bottle,3.43,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3/24/2010,"12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
My worry with all beers that start life in the USA and claim to be ""English"" style, is that we will get over-hopped products with alcohol that is too high and malt profiles that are insufficiently developed. This beer confirmed my reservations on two of those but did better on one.
Decent copper body with good clarity and a nice white head that is well retained and leaves good lace. The appearance was the strongest suit in this beer for me.
It's clearly too high in ABV to put it into ""sessionable"", but that's where beers of this nature really need to sit. The hop profile was sufficiently muted (good), but the biscuit malt intensity to accompany that was missing and ultimately disappointed.
Not a ""bad"" beer as such but in the end it just comes up short all over the place."
Brouwerij De Ranke,De Ranke H.O.P. Flower Power,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,6.00%,bottle,4.33,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,3/21/2010,"750 mL bottle that came from Green's on Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA. In the $14-15 range.
As expected, a very interesting beer.
The beer pours a very nice, deep orange color with a decent head that is well formed and leaves some nice lace.
Nose has a very distinct aroma that to me, is not especially hoppy. It's more of a sinus clearing white pepper effect.
Tastes are very dry with a distinct pepper note and a definite soapy presence that reminds me (strangely) of a Courage Best Bitter from years and years ago! Very odd. Quite a large portion of dry grapefruit also cuts in and is very prominent in the finish.
I'd be interested in finding out the hop profile for this beer, since it seems to remind me of an English Bitter or Pale in in many respects. At the time of writing the De Ranke web site is of no help.
Interesting beer with a dry finish and lots of astringent bitterness. Definitely more ""Saison"" than ""Belgian IPA""."
"Lakefront Brewery, Inc.",Big Easy Imperial Maibock,,,Maibock / Helles Bock,7.10%,bottle,3.35,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,3/21/2010,"12oz, $1.35 single from Green's on Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Honey colored body with a nice white head but it lacks much retention or lace.
Nose is surprisingly sharp with a sweet and sour elements and seems quite alcoholic - a bit odd.
The tastes break-in with typical-for-the-style, musty yeast notes and some light funk which is the way that the sour bitterness sometimes manifests itself.
Pretty straightforward with alcohol below the advertised 7.1%."
Magic Hat Brewing Company,Odd Notion (Summer 09),,,Belgian Pale Ale,5.90%,bottle,3.88,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,3/21/2010,"$1.35 as a 12 oz single from Green's on Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour gives a lightly hazed, well carbonated golden yellow. Small head.
Nose has a really nice yeasty presence - good for the style.
Tastes reflect the nose and are sweet and yeast based as one would expect. A decent amount of Belgian character for me, and this could easily pass for a Belgian ""single or ""simple"" in a cafe around Grand Place.
Nice to get a simple beer that plays a role that fits the style and re-creates an experience that is recognizable."
Goose Island Beer Co.,Pere Jacques,,,Dubbel,8.00%,bottle,3.48,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3/19/2010,"12 oz single from Jungle Jim's, Cincinnati, OH, USA. 2009 vintage.
Bottled on 10/05/09. Also has 2019 printed next to it which I first thought might be a BB date, but that would contradict the text on the label that says it will develop in the bottle for up to 5 years. Maybe a batch #.
Poured into the Terrapin snifter the beer ultimately settles to take on the appearance of a cognac. Still, light copper colored body with zero hint of head or lace. Strange since it suggests a MUCH higher ABV.
A lot of brown sugar and alcohol in the nose. This gives way to some massive bubble-gum highlights in the mouth and finishes with plenty of warming alcohol. The bubble-gum is somewhat off-putting as it seems to go against the style. It IS in line with a big, sugary candy note, but it seems out of context for a Dubbel and a Belgian yeast note is not there.
Strange beast and not my cup of tea."
Three Floyds Brewing Co. / Brewery & Pub,Moloko,,,Milk / Sweet Stout,8.00%,bottle,4.18,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,3/18/2010,"22 oz bottle, thanks to Micah (DogBrick) for the chance to try this beer.
Jet black body with a lovely looking mocha colored head. Small, fine bubbles with nice density. Very compact and tight with a degree of orange color that seems to match the label. (Perhaps my imagination!)
A super beer that captures a lovely combination of the lactose sugar and mild sweetness that come together in the way that a sweet stout should, i.e. as a welcome, refreshing antidote to the incessant onslaught of a roasty bitterness that we find in so many American stouts (both RIS and ""regular"").
The sweetness is really reserved and generally I prefer it to be a bit more advanced in my Milk stouts, but this still drinks beautifully.
Extremely smooth with a lovely mild carbonation that really adds to the drinkability of the beer.
Very tasty and although perhaps not as sweet as some in the style, I still really enjoyed this. Would definitely try again."
Bison Brewing Co.,Bison Organic Honey Basil,,,Herbed / Spiced Beer,6.00%,bottle,3.48,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3/14/2010,"12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour is a fairly dark orange body with a fast receding head and little retention.
The nose and tastes do not benefit much from the honey, but there is a distinct herbal quality to the beer which reminds me a little of a a Cinzano Bianco or other herbed/spiced vermouth. This is not really recognizable (at least to me) as specifically being basil, but the herbal nature is unmistakable.
The herb nature adds an organic, green feel to the beer and a refreshing edge to the beer hat feels clean and new.
Enjoyable as a change of pace."
Bluegrass Brewing Company,Rye 75,,,American IPA,7.50%,bottle,3.2,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,3/14/2010,"Big thanks go out to Kevin for the chance to try this BBC beer.
Impressive, champagne style presentation with a THICK, gold foil on the neck of the capped, 750 mL behemoth!
Pour gives a standard, mid brown IPA-like body but some excellent, thick, frothy head and lace that lingers. Solid looking.
Nose gives a very distinct rye whiff right off the bat, and this builds even more with increasing temperature.
The tastes do the same, with the spiced rye building over the course of the beer as the hop presence takes a bit of a back seat as the temperature warms. The spiced nature of the malt really doesn't give one a break from the bittering angle and the beer gets difficult to drink in any kind of quantity for me.
I'm generally not a huge fan of rye beers, but this one was OK. It's difficult for me to get really enthusiastic about them though, since I find the combination of a spicy, aggressive malt alongside the hops to give me a little too much of an assault on the palate. This gives the beer a combination that reduces the drinkability for me, but that is really a personal preference.
Hard work for me in this quantity and probably a good beer for the rye loving crowd but not one for me."
Nøgne Ø - Det Kompromissløse Bryggeri A/S,Imperial DunkelWit,,,Witbier,10.00%,bottle,3.48,5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3/14/2010,"So what's going on here? More craziness from Scandinavia? We'll see.
Picked this one up at Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA. 500 mL bottle approx. $8-9 for the chance to try this one.
Poured into the Tucher, 0.5 L Weizen glass the beer is truly exceptional. An amazing color of reddish brown which is deep and garnet in its' color, but in certain light almost looks purple - VERY distinct! Surprisingly good head, lace and retention for a beer with this ABV.
The nose gives up some alcohol and a very strong herbal, spiced and medicinal note.
Tastes are somewhat bizarre. At first the beer seems like liquid licorice - literally! After that we get varying amounts of pepper, MORE licorice, medicinal herbs. Then comes a serious wave of aniseed bitterness which ultimately is the distinguishing taste. Aniseed is the final flourish and the has the final word. Light alcohol burn. Very odd.
Mouthfeel is quite lively.
A licorice aniseed BOMB!
I dunno, it seems like Nogne are getting increasingly distracted by the American influence of doing weird stuff and for me it's not working. It's just getting a little too quirky and bizarre and the experimental nature of the brew seems to be overtaking the taste - ""crazy"" is often not ""good""."
Saint Somewhere Brewing Company,Pays Du Soleil,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,8.00%,bottle,3.6,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3/14/2010,"750 ml, corked and caged, usual St. Somewhere presentation.
Pretty interesting beer to say the least that pushes the boundaries of what I'm comfortable with.
Pour is an usually dark color for a Saison and takes on an orangy, peach hue with significant cloudiness. Looks like sweet tea. Head is good initially but becomes spotty quite quickly and lacks much retention or lace.
The nose is aggressively floral and estery with massive pear, peach and pineapple notes thrusting through the nasal passages. This is NOT subtle and really gets a little too much for me quite quickly - and this is coming from someone that tends to like this kind of big fruity aroma as well.
Tastes follow the nose with a non-too subtle arrangement of the aromas coming together with a slightly medicinal edge as well. A definite sweet and sour effect takes over and the beer is a touch syrupy as well. Slightly building alcohol too.
This is NOT a clean, bright, fresh, vibrant Saison to me, rather it is a heavy going floral package that is better in smaller doses. Do not expect a simple beer either, there are some complex bubble-gum notes and heavy sugars that remind me of a Doppelbock or large Weizen (oddly). Starts to round out with some more alcohol and further peach and flowery characteristics.
Odd beer, and one which I'm going to have to re-visit before I actually understand."
Firestone Walker Brewing Co.,Firestone 10 - Anniversary Ale,,,American Strong Ale,12.00%,bottle,4.15,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,3/13/2010,"Huge thanks go out to Grant for sharing this at the Brick Store.
Dark mahogany pour that produced a pretty good head considering the age of the beer, the style and the ABV. One of the most distinct parts of this beer (at least visually) were the legs.
The aroma is quite complex with a fairly large dose of vanilla. As Gregg pointed out, you could certainly detect a sort of old, musty hop note in the aroma too.
Smooth and warming in the mouth and a mild burn on the way down. Definitely manifests some more alcohol in the mouthfeel.
Tastes are light alcohol with some nice liquor like notes up front. It finishes with a chocolate like note, but it's not a stout like, smooth chocolate taste but much more like a semi-sweet, bakers chocolate. A bit of cocoa too. The baker's chocolate brings a seriously dry note in the finish that was surprising. It's a complex beer but the sum of the parts is not stunning for me, rather just very solid. Despite the alcohol in the nose it is well hidden in the taste (at least relatively).
Absolutely delighted to have had the chance to try this - thanks again Grant."
Brouwerij Lindemans,Lindemans Faro Lambic,,,Faro,4.20%,bottle,3.38,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3/12/2010,"Thanks go out to Kevin for hooking me up here.
Pour is a rich looking, brown with a decent amount of head considering the style. This is not a highly carbonated style and it has the tendency to feel a bit flat.
Nose and tastes are crushingly sweet. Very pronounced sugars and candy notes dominate just about everything else that might be competing for your attention.
The mouthfeel and some of the tastes (and indeed the look) remind me quite a lot of Duchesse but obviously significantly sweeter. There's a certain quality about this beer which makes it feel slightly old and musty, almost as if the bottle has been hanging around for an extended period of time. I've noticed this with one or two other examples of the style and I'm beginning to think that this is basically a feature of beers like this one.
All in all this is not a beer (or a style) that really captures my attention and as such this will be a very infrequent visitor to my table. Nevertheless delighted to have tried it."
San Miguel Corporation,San Miguel Dark Lager,,,Euro Dark Lager,5.00%,bottle,3.3,2.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,3/12/2010,"Single from Total Wine @ Perimeter, Atlanta, GA, USA.
I wouldn't go as far as to say that I ""like"" this beer, but what I will say is that it pretty much nails the style. Now, whether or not you consider that to be a good thing is a different question, but I suppose we should offer some credit!
Black pour with some significant orangy/red highlights. The color is fine bu the beer is quite badly let down by the lack of persistent head - it dies in the glass very quickly.
Obviously a sweetish, malt based beer with not much hop presence (if any) at all. Very malty all the way through with little other clear flavors. Perhaps a touch of bittering licorice but that's about it. Some residual sugar on the tongue.
Finishes a tad musty and one is plenty."
The Bruery,Saison De Lente,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,6.50%,bottle,4.65,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,5,3/11/2010,"750 mL capped bottle.
Recent addition to The Bruery line-up in GA.
Pour is a resplendent, butterscotch yellow with a creamy looking white head that looks dense. 
The nose has some light Brett that does not really manifest itself in the tastes which suits me just fine! In fact, I'm happy that it does not come into the picture too much in terms of the palate. the nose is further enhanced with some serious Belgian yest character. VERY nice.
The mouthfeel is a VERY strong part of this beer. Deep and creamy in its nature, it manages to pull off the look that the head suggests. 
The tastes are all about a very light touch, and the Brett is so reserved that I would go as far as to say that this drinks much more like a Belgian Pale and less like the Saison that it claims to be. Not a great deal of funk here at all, but some light grapefruit and plenty of yeasty character. There's also light lemon and some classic white pepper on the tongue too.
If you are looking for a Brett infused beer, forget it. This drinks like a slightly hopped Belgian Pale, perhaps even putting a single toe into the Belgian IPA pool. Either way it is subtle and enormously drinkable. A classy beer that transcends a lot of nonsense and gets right down to quality and drinkability in a couple of easy steps."
Buckeye Brewing Company,Hippie I.P.A.,,,American IPA,6.80%,bottle,3.7,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,3/10/2010,"Thanks go out to Seth for the chance to try this one.
Poured from the 22 oz bomber the body is a lightly hazed, light copper color. The head is light and fluffy but impressive in terms of retention and lace. Bone white.
If the truth be told this is a very simple beer, but well constructed and the kind of thing that could easily be overlooked. Careful attention will find an easy drinking, well built American IPA that should garner respect.
Malty and bready nose and upfront tastes are followed by assertive (but not aggressive) hops to complete the picture. Clean, light grapefruit notes finish the beer.

Surprisingly golden/orange pour with good clarity - like a little like a Tripel in terms of color. Head is minimal and limited to sticky film on the surface of the beer and some creamy bubbles at the edges.
Nose gives quite a lot of sweetness and a hint of medicinal hop character but not much.
Tastes have some chest warming alcohol and more sweet candy notes but a lack of any great hop presence. To me this drinks more like a Tripel than anything else with some light, white pepper and some lemony spice. Hops are there, but are very reserved, perhaps manifesting themselves most strongly in the aftertaste and finish. Dry in the final flourish.
Quite a thick, syrupy mouthfeel too which once again takes me to Tripel thoughts rather than Belgian IPA.
Drinkable and tasty, but a beer that is sweeter than many other Belgian IPA renditions I have tried. Much more like a hopped-up Tripel to me."
"Bell's Brewery, Inc.",Bell's Batch 9000,,,American Strong Ale,12.50%,bottle,3.7,4,4,4,4,2.5,3/9/2010,"Mass hysteria broke out in Atlanta on the release of this beer with single bottle limits are general geek, pant-wetting. I was given a couple on a recent trip to Kentucky without the general, associated madness - thanks Kevin.
12 oz single. Pour is a dark brown/black Porter like affair. Little lace other than a touch of spotty character on the surface. Obviously the ABV impairs any significant head or retention. It ultimately dies to just about zero carbonation which is OK.
Nose is an extremely rich, sweet. liquor based aroma. Some alcohol but not overpowering at all. The liquor element is prominent. Obviously some good alcohol legs. The alcohol manifests itself with even more sweetness.
A very sweet rum infused assault is the start on the tongue. The molasses and licorice are certainly there, but they combine to give a slightly smoky charcoal bitterness and the rum like sweetness still continues to shine through. Slightly bitter, dry aftertaste and with it the slightest hint of hop character - VERY slight! 
One might describe this as a poor man's Utopia's (after the initial carbonation has gone) as it tastes and drinks in a very similar manner.
If you don't enjoy a sweet beer you'd better stay away. Certainly a pretty extreme brew and a beer that is in a bottle about twice the size it needs to be, but still a pretty interesting beast - In fact it reminds me a little of Avery's The Beast! Drinkability is not great, but that's really a given for a 12.5% beer.
In the end, fine, but 6 oz every six months would be too much for me."
Saint Louis Brewery / Schlafly Tap Room,Schlafly Pale Ale,,,English Pale Ale,4.40%,bottle,3.45,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3/9/2010,"Ha, Ha - very nearly a true session beer made by an American brewer - NEARLY! Thanks go out to DogBrick for the chance to sample this 12 oz offering.
Pour has a somewhat uninspired color (a hazed, light brown/orange) but better than expected head, retention and lace. Quite sticky and more in line with a higher ABV IPA.
Nose and tastes are in the English style, but both are less fruity and drier than one would expect. There isn't really the depth of biscuit malt that would would normally associate with a true English Pale and that takes away some character for me. The dry character builds and this beer does not have the malts that are really needed. Conversely it has a pretty low hop profile too, and the combination makes it a touch too light for the style in terms of flavor; the depth is just not there. There is a very light (almost diet) grapefruit in the back end.
On the plus side very drinkable and hit has a clean edge that makes it drinkable if a touch light in the mouth.
Not a great example of the style, but these days if get a beer less than 5% from an American brewery I feel somewhat happy, anyway!"
Fort Collins Brewing,Maibock,,,Maibock / Helles Bock,6.30%,bottle,4.15,5,4,4,4,4.5,3/8/2010,"Fresh brewed beer, 22 oz bottles now reaching GA. Purchased this one at Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA. Request to have the beer un-retired in db made 03-07-10.
Pour is an exquisite looking, beautiful red garnet color with a tan colored, rich head. Looks excellent with maximum red/copper highlights catching the sun.
Nose and tastes combine in the way that they should for the style with a significant yeast not amongst the deep, repeating, rich malts. Very good depth of flavor. Tastes are caramel based with a persistent nod to the yeast. Finishes rich and bready. Some alcohol too.
Superb example of the style (in an American sense) and a very nice addition to the GA scene. Solid beer with excellent drinkability. 
Very strong (in a solid sense not a ABV sense) beer."
Goose Island Beer Co.,Sofie,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,6.50%,bottle,4.55,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,3/7/2010,"Delighted to pick this 22 oz bottle up from Jungle Jim's in Cincinnati. Presentation is great with the green gold and white label adding a classy touch to the beer. The paper is a little higher quality too, with that slightly textured, cotton effect. Bottled on Oct 23, this is a 2009 vintage.
Pour is a beautiful, rich, yellow golden body with a nice, bright white head. Lace and retention are very good. Smashing looking beer.
Nose has light straw amongst the mild funk and barnyard notes. Some slight lemon zest but it's pretty reserved.
Tastes seems more funky than the nose would suggest at first, but this backs down fairly quickly to even out to a moderate funk. Dry notes in the finish with a nice, and surprising champagne like carbonation at the back end. The tastes manifest the orange peel more and more with an increasing note of bitterness amongst the horse-blanket. 
Very clean and dry but still manages to compliment those attributes with sufficient citrus fruit pith and zest to keep it all together. Overall the emphasis seems to be on the Farmhouse side of things rather than the Saison.
A beautifully constructed beer which reminds me a sweltering hot European continent summers and optimistic spring days. There's a lot of character about this beer which screams France and Belgium to me, and makes me yearn for some Gite and street cafe time. Delightful beer that catches my imagination."
The Brew Keeper,R Lager,,,American Adjunct Lager,4.60%,bottle,2.9,3.5,3.5,2.5,3,3,3/7/2010,"22 oz bottle from Kenny Road Market, Columbus, OH, USA. $5.49. The label on the bottle is obviously amateurish which is probably a combination of deliberate style and cost consideration. Either way it looks like it was done by a freshman art class.
Pour is a little odd with a clouded butterscotch appearance that was mildly reminiscent of a Hefe or other wheat beer. Strange. Head was poorly retained though and the lace was watery.
Nose was a nice combination of sweet malts and some citrus based volatiles.
Tastes are quite frankly bland. The zesty nature of the nose is not transfered to the taste with any authority and there is a prickly mouthfeel that seems a little out of place. No offensive so the drinkability does not suffer too much, but this is the kind of beer that I could only appreciate if I was really dying for a beer. I thought it tasted like something I could make in my basement without too much difficulty. Again it seems ""wheaty"" to me.
Strange beer and unlikely to be visited again by me."
Founders Brewing Company,Founders Nemesis 2009,,,Wheatwine,12.00%,bottle,3.95,3,4.5,4,4,3.5,3/5/2010,"12 oz single in the usual Founders bottle presentation. From Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA. $4.99 for the single.
Murky, honey orange pour with a thin film of wispy foam on the surface of the beer. No head and no retention. Some viscous legs greet the eye too.
Nose has some extremely large vanilla sugar notes - very big.
Tastes have some bourbon character that builds. It's not an especially aggressive beer in terms of the depth, and to be honest it melds better than I was expecting. This is not a beer that I would normally enjoy but this works relatively well. There's some spice flavor which seems to temper the alcohol a bit. In fact, the alcohol is quite well hidden.
Increased vanilla as the beer warms but it never gets sweet. Some bitterish honey notes (presumably from the maple) that manifest themselves in the finish.
The mouthfeel is especially viscous and syrup-like and although entirely appropriate given the style and the ABV, it remains as a prominent feature.
Better than expected for me, but still strictly a one-off in my book."
Stoudts Brewing Co.,Stoudt's Heifer-in-Wheat,,,Hefeweizen,5.00%,bottle,4.23,4,4,4.5,4,4,3/4/2010,"12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA a couple of weeks ago. Unfortunately this had best before 11/27/09 dot-matrixed on the neck, this is one that slipped through the cracks.
Murky yellow pour with not much head, lace or retention. 
Nose has a really fruity, very lemony clove and banana note. Tastes very bright despite being a little past the Best By date and the fruit does not manifest itself quite as strongly as it did in the aroma. We get some more light acidity and some more banana with a tangy edge.
More brightness and wheat inthe finish and aftertaste.
Drinks very easily and I'd imagine fresh and on draft this beer would be a big hit with. Although not exactly in the same league it reminded me strongly of Live Oak! That's very high praise."
Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),Samuel Adams Noble Pils,,,Czech Pilsener,4.90%,bottle,2.55,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3/3/2010,"An impressive number of reviews for a beer that's only been out for a couple of months. I suppose that reflects both the distribution of Sam Adams and the relative power of BBC's advertising reach - they really are a macro, micro!
I actually bought this 22 oz bomber on the road in OH. It's been here in GA for a few months now but I've only seen it here as a 12 pack, then again I've not really been looking for it.
Pour is pretty much as expected with good clarity but the color is really VERY light almost to the point of being watery in appearance. I was surprised at the lack of real color. Wispy, eggshell white, delicate head with some nice lace.
Nose is a little bit corny, a little sweet and slightly vegetal. I might even say ""macro"" like! Not distinctive and somewhat unimpressive. Lacks hop character.
Tastes are fine, but lack a real Saaz BITE in the finish that I'm usually looking for in my Pilsners. There are some competing hop notes with a touch of grapefruit, a touch of metallic coinage and some fresh green notes, BUT it seems a little muddled. When I say muddled, I don't mean in a ""messy"", unpleasant way, rather it seems that the competing hops seem to add up to somewhat less than they should. It doesn't quite come together for me and I think that simplicity would have been better.
I'm not sure that the beer has benefited from the over complication of hops - too clever? Unimpressive to me with a very watery character and some serious lack of depth. Disappointing."
Southampton Publick House,Imperial Russian Stout,,,Russian Imperial Stout,10.20%,bottle,3.45,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3/3/2010,"750 mL bottle, #396 out of 400; 2009 vintage. Shared with BEERchitect on a visit to Lexington, KY.
Standard, balck pour with a less than impressive mocha-like head (ABV obviously curtails this a little)) but still surprisingly poor given the fizzy nature of the beer. The carbonation seems really high at first and this leads to an annoyingly, prickly mouthfeel that subsides a bit but seems present throughout the brew for me.
Nose and tastes release a LOT of burned character, and it all gets a bit much charcoal like for me. As kevin said, burned berries are in there.
Not much smooth character at all, and although the beer does lose some carbonation as the time passes, it still seems overly aggressive and bitter. Not much chocalte, malt or coffee to temper the sharp edges.
I generally really like Southampton but this beer seems a bit on the high side of burned for me. Alcohol was obviously opresent but not too aggressive, but the charcoal notes would simply not die for me.
I dunno, this just didn't do it much for me, perhaps a beer that would benefit from some longer term aging?"
BridgePort Brewing Co. / Brewpub + Bakery,Hop Czar,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,7.50%,bottle,4.23,4,4,4.5,4,4,2/21/2010,"On tap at the newly re-named place that used to be The Grange and The Angel and is now called The Marlay House.
Pour is a solid looking, strong orange body with a small amount of head but excellent, sticky lace.
Nose and tastes reveal plenty of fresh, citrus hop character and not much else. Decent sweetness accompanies the hop-fix and malts hold it together nicely.
A good example of how the hops can be amped up without causing a palate meltdown. As balanced as a DIPA can ever hope to beer, the beer drinks fairly easily but palate fatigue could still settle in quite quickly.
For me, strictly a one-off, hp-fix beer, but nevertheless a very nice departure from me usually favored path."

Pour gives a lovely, deep garnet body and some head and lace that were better than I was expecting. It had some real depth in the visuals.
A very surprising beer. I was waiting to be overrun with the Bourbon experience but the rush of alcohol and warming vanilla notes simply did not come. Some age on this beer may have altered it dramatically, and the beer was very mellow.
Oddly it seemed to have some earth notes, and a little grass hay and green feel. I wouldn't go as far as to say ""saison-like"", not did I taste any ""funk"" as such, but there seemed to be a fresh hop note around the beer. It remained sweet (as a I was expecting) but it did NOT deliver on the BIG bourbon note. To be honest, although i was surprised I actually still enjoyed the beer very much.
My guess is that a little age has gone a long way to changing this beer which was interesting.
More drinkable than I thought it might be as well.
A bit of crazy experience with this one and I wouldn't mind betting that my tasting was pretty atypical."
Mikkeller,Santa's Little Helper 2009,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,10.90%,bottle,3.15,4,3.5,3,3,3,2/21/2010,"750 mL, corked, caged and red-foiled affair. $12.99 from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Rich looking dark brown pour with a creamy, tan head. Some nice, creamy lace and a thin film forms on the surface and around the rim.
A few cocoa notes and some Belgian yeast in the nose, along with a bit of hop presence.
The beer doesn't deliver many (if any) typical Dark Belgian character. Outside of the look, it gives a slightly odd cocoa note (that I don't much care for) and is low on the advertised spices. It also doesn't really come through on the big, plummy dark Belgian fruit either. Some residual sweetness BUT a surprising amount of hop presence. The hops come through is a strange aniseed like manner which I find less than appealing. Dry character that I suppose comes from the cocoa input. Lacks rich, creamy alcoholic and deep fruit character.
Not a bad beer, but it does not do the job as a BSDA, nor does it deliver a typical Christmas spice character. I'm afraid it does not come together all that well either."
New Belgium Brewing,Mighty Arrow Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),6.00%,bottle,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,2/21/2010,"12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA.
Very simple, but well constructed brew.
Orange, slightly chill-hazed body underneath the firm, white egg-shell head; average lace and retention. Looks solid.
Very light citrus aroma with a decent malt base that comes through with some English style biscuit flavors in he flavor. Tangy, orange based hop finish, but nothing of any real consequence.
Mouthefeel and drinkability seem fairly standard.
Tasty and simple fare that one could drink a couple of and real mildly satisfied.
Another beer that I would drink over BMC, but in no way am likely to seek out. A nice beer to drink locally, fresh and close to the source I suspect, but away from those circumstances this beer is likely to be lost in the sea of standard APA 
(and such) offerings."
Rogue Brewery (Brewer's on the Bay),John John Dead Guy Ale,,,Maibock / Helles Bock,6.40%,bottle,2.9,3.5,3,2.5,4,3,2/21/2010,"22 oz bottle from Smyrna World of Beverage. Around $8-9 for the privilege.
Probably should have taken a closer look at the label here rather than just grabbing it, as I'm not a huge fan of either Dead Guy or barrel aging in general - ho hum.
At first glance I wondered if this was another of those annoying Rogue habits where the beer get re-packaged and re-named. Apparently I'm in the clear.
Beer seems slightly over-carbonated as I open the bottle.
Creamy head sits a top of a light copper body with a large stream of bubble. Some lace, retention OK.
Nose reveals a light, bourbon/whiskey nose with some mellow vanilla. The nose of the liquor is stronger than appears in the taste, but the beer seems to struggle with an awkward sweetness and a bitter finish. It's all a bit strange with apparently strongly competing flavor profiles up against one another. Finish is annoyingly bitter and dry. Metal adds confusion in the lingering, oaky ending. the whiskey element is really a light caramel or toffee which is OK but not my favorite flavor profile. Plenty of malt presence but it never comes together for me.
Mouthfeel is one of the better features and is relatively rich.
This doesn't work much for me which is not surprising as we are starting with a beer I'm not in love with and added the barrel component which I'm not a fan of either. Not for me."
"The Tap / Haverhill Brewery, Inc",Joshua Norton Imperial Stout,,,Russian Imperial Stout,9.30%,bottle,4.33,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,2/21/2010,"22 oz bomber from the October 2009 bottling, drunk in Feb 2010.
Pour gives a standard black affair with medium head, retention and a little lace.
Nose and tastes are quite restrained with all of the usual roast, light bitter and mild-chocolate notes but it is ALL very restrained and tempered. This is also true of the alcohol which gives a tiny bit of heat to the finish, but to describe it any other way than subtle would be wrong.
If you are looking for an aggressive, hop-forward high alcohol beast for your RIS experience, I think that you will be disappointed. I on the other had, was delighted by the approachability of this beer and the way that it drank - super offering.
Alcohol is very well hidden, and along with the mild roast notes and understated nature of the beer, this is extremely drinkable and does not seems like an aggressive beer at all. The drinkability score reflects some of that.
Tasty and a beer i would definitely try again."
Terrapin Beer Company,Terrapin Oak Aged Wake-n-Bake Coffee Oatmeal Imperial Stout,,,American Double / Imperial Stout,8.00%,on-tap,4.28,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,2/20/2010,"I've had this three times in the last couple of weeks at the Taco Mac on the East West Connector, Austell, GA, USA.
Pour is the standard , lose to black affair with virtually no head other than a thin film of mocha foam. Mouthfeel seems a little slick but comes with the standard coffee and light alcohol notes. The oak-aging seems very light with perhaps an increased vanilla presence and some edges taken off.
I really didn't find this to be much different to the regular version but perhaps it's just smoothed out some; it may be that the same effect could have been achieved by simply letting the original sit.
In the end l enjoyed the beer but is it that different to the original?"
The Bruery,Papier,,,Old Ale,14.50%,bottle,4.38,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,2/20/2010,"A very, very interesting beer to say the least, but in the final analysis a bit too much all the way around.
Nicely presented, black waxed 750 mL bottle. Seemed to be doble-dipped on the wax which made it a pain to get into. Capped underneath.
Pour is a very dark brown affair with one of the most interesting head colors that i have ever seen. It was almost a fluorescent yellow/gold/orange color, and was made up of large bubbles at the edge of the beer. Very odd looking.
The nose and tastes are VERY complex with layer after layer of sweet, molasses based sugars that do not let up. It's a very sweet beer with plenty of alcohol and brown sugar based complexity. Some dark fruits as well, but the beer is certainly never ""fruity"" by any stretch of the imagination. Alcohol builds and the obvious lack of carbonation (consider ABV and style), alhough appropriate , does begin to grate a little toward the middle of the vbottle.
I used a couple of glasses to marinate some salmon on the grill, and this was a good decision for two reasons. Firstly it provided a delicious , rich coating to the fish and secondly it allowed me to back away from the WHOLE bottle! It was beginning to creep up on me a bit.
Mouthfeel is excellent and smooth without ever getting overbearing and the beer (obviously) improves with temperature as the bottle is consumed.
A beer than one could really use to replace a nice liquor with, and the sweetness began to take the beer from Old Ale into the English Barleywine designation.
Very interesting and a beer that i'd like to try again in different circumstances."
Yuengling Brewery ,Yuengling Bock,,,Bock,5.10%,on-tap,3.78,3.5,4,4,3,3.5,2/13/2010,"On tap Taco Mac, Douglasville, GA, USA.
Pour is an attractive, mid to dark copper colour with thinnish, wispy head. Fades quickly.
Lots of bready malts in the nose. One of the more ""bready"" beers that I have encoutered of late.
Clean delivery of good malt and hop balance. Bitterness with a gentle metallic aftertaste. Slight sweet and sour combo brings the whole thing together. Conversely for the typical malt profile, this bock seems to finish a touch on the dry end of the spectrum. Adding to the experience is the Enlish style biscuit malt profile that pairs well with the slight bitterness.
Carbonation is a little high which provokes a slightly prickly mouthfeel that the beer could do without. Apart from that th remains drinkable and tasty."
Saint Arnold Brewing Company,Saint Arnold Divine Reserve #7,,,Weizenbock,8.40%,bottle,3.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,2/12/2010,"12 oz stubbie as per usual from SA in the DR series.
Pour is a dark, dark brown essentially black with a fizzy, coffee colored head. Retention and lace not great.
Nice dark estery malts and fruit in the nose.
Tastes reflect some of those traits but some oxidation plus somewhat surprising mild licorice notes that one might find in a Belgian style stout. Sweetness and alcohol both present but really quite reserved. The stout notes are really quite prominent and they build.
Smooth and silky in the mouth, with a slight bitter banana in the finish - the only real obvious sign of the style.
Still drinking well as long as you don't mind a touch of oxidation (I don't) and some maturing of the flavors. I did not have this fresh so I have no idea how it has changed, nevertheless very drinkable and tasty."
Spoetzl Brewery,Shiner Fröst,,,Dortmunder / Export Lager,5.50%,bottle,4.35,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,2/12/2010,"12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour is a very attractive, deep, orange gold body with a pretty good, dense well-formed head. Even some lace and pretty nice retention. Surprisingly good looking.
Carbonation is constant and the nose gives some slight sweetness.
The tastes are quite sweet with a nice malt base and light hop finish. More sweetness and some grains come through and the finish is satisfying. The aftertaste lingers with a touch of bitterness. Deeper and more complex that one might expect with some toffee like sweetness.
A little bit of slickness in the mouth, but to be honest it works quite well. Finishes creamier than the first gulps suggest.
This has the character of a beer with a lot more alcohol and reminds me a bit of a better tasting, higher ABV Euro Lager. It drinks better than I expected and is really quite tasty.
This is a very nice beer that drinks well and does a lot for the style and the brewery. Surprising on both counts."
Abita Brewing Co.,Restoration Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),5.00%,bottle,3.73,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,2/7/2010,"Restoration. 12 oz bottle, Taco Mac, Douglasville, GA, USA.
Macro color but carbonation is strong. Head and lace decent too. Surprinsingly impressive pour especially in the bottle. Light hops in the nose with some simple malt/grain. After that all balanced malts.
Smooth & simple. Some low level bittering and dryness. Mouthfeel is quite good and better than the look would suggest.
Pale malts dominate in terms of tastes with a light sprinkling of hops on top.
Tasty if somewhat unspectacular. Thirst quenching. One of the better Abita offerings IMO."
Founders Brewing Company,Founders Double Trouble,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,9.40%,bottle,4.45,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,2/7/2010,"12 oz, stubbie single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA. One of the few Founder's beers currently in GA that I have not had before their recent arrival.
Pour is a very surprising golden hue which s extremely attractive. Much lighter than I was expecting with a very good-looking, white, rocky head and lace. The head and retention are especially pleasing when you consider the ABV. Talking of the alcohol it's nowhere to be seen. Extraordinarily well hidden and I would have NEVER guessed this is as high as it is. Amazing.
Plenty of fruity grapefruit notes hold up the whole beer. There is no doubt that this is a very hoppy DIPA, but the fruit character is something that I was not expecting in such large doses - very welcome.
Drinks easily without any cloying sweetness or dramatic, astringent bitterness.
For me the grapefruit and other estery fruit notes make this beer a winner. One of the few brews that can pull off the hop presence and alcohol in a relatively subtle and restrained way. Excellent beer."
Rogue Brewery (Brewer's on the Bay),Chatoe Rogue First Growth Dirtoir Black Lager,,,Schwarzbier,6.00%,bottle,3,4,3,3,2.5,3,2/7/2010,"Silly name.
22 oz bottle in the usual Rogue presentation from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Jet black pour but without asignificant head or lace.
The hop nose and hop tastes are suprisingly reserved for Rogue, but at the same time too large for the style IMO. This is essentially an ""Americanized"" version of a Schwarzbier which, unsurprisingly, takes the hop profile way too far for me. Lingering bitterness replaces a sweet edge, and the hops also provide a biting note that detracts from the mouthfeel for me as well. In the grand scheme of things not especially astringent, but in the style we're dealing with here it's way off for me.
Roasty malts are present, but again they seem more bitter than we should expect in a classic Schwarz.
Drinkability is OK as long as you are not looking for a classic example.
In summary, although not a beer that is particularly ""hoppy"", it's still *too* hoppy and pretty much exactly as I anticipated from Rogue."
Brasserie Des Géants,Gouyasse Triple,,,Tripel,9.00%,bottle,4.05,5,4,4,4,4,2/6/2010,"Fantastic ice-cream like head over the clouded yellow body with some haze. Lace, retention and general appearance of the head are second to none. Light tangerine color. 
Nose has some light floral notes with a touch of white pepper and a little yeast character.
The tastes reflect some of the nose but refuse to deliver the sweetness or indeed the alcohol blast, that one would expect from a beer in this style. Spices are generally missing.
Finish is dry and the bitterness builds to a degree. More floral character amongst the dry ending.
Tasty and drinkable, but not really typically ""Tripel"" - too dry and laclks much sweetness. Still enjoyable."
Magic Hat Brewing Company,Vinyl,,,American Amber / Red Lager,5.10%,on-tap,3.35,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,2/6/2010,"On tap Taco Mac, Douglasville, GA, USA.
Nice clarity and good dark copper color on the pour. Head is small but provides some lace.
Nose faithfully creates some decent if simple, toasty malt. Tastes deliver the expected malt notes but the beer also brings with a surprising level of dry character. Dry notes are repeated in the finish and aftertaste almost to the point of giving some noticeable hop character - not really what I was anticipating. 
Carbonation in the glass seems quite strong without manifesting any kind of prickle. The bitterness seems to build a little too. As the beer drinks the aftertaste seems to give a bit of a dry, bakers chocolate, cocoa flavor as well.
Decent balance but the beer seems dry to me and this is despite the relatively good depth of malt. In that respect a bit of a paradox. Drinkability suffers a touch because of the dry notes."
New Belgium Brewing,Ranger,,,American IPA,6.50%,on-tap,3.55,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,2/6/2010,"On tap Taco Mac, Douglasville, GA, USA.
Pour is a very attractive golden hue with very good sticky lace. Appearance is the best part of the beer for me.
Steady but mild bitterness with a clean edge that showcase the apparently pale malt base and the fresh hop feel. Aroma is clean. 
Well constructed for sure, but to be honest ultimately not a stand-out by any stretch. The bazillionth solid American IPA - yawn. Not sure how thi stuff will carve a niche for itself.
Decent drinkability but not something I'm likely to seek again."
Trader Joe's Brewing Company,Josephs Brau Winterfest,,,Doppelbock,7.50%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,2/6/2010,"In a word, impressed.
You never quite know what you are going to get with these cheap, 12 oz singles from TJ's but to be honest more often than not I have been really pleased with what I've found. This was no exception.
Really deep, garnet copper body with some lovely light coffee-colored head. Lace and retention are not the best, but the clarity and the depth of color are both very nice.
Lovely sweetness in the taste - I suspect it will be too much fro some, but if you like a sweet, malt based profile this hits the spot immediately. Burned sugars ans LOTS of caramel - I mean, LOTS. The bock/Dopplebock characteristics are not really too prevalent and the yeast character is restrained, but the sugar and sweetness are certainly there. Some dark fruits too, and a decent depth on the mouthfeel.
The alcohol is extremely well hidden.
Very pleased with this one, and perhaps not a classic in the style, nor a beer that is likely to attract many plaudits, but if you love a sweet brew with heavy emphasis on the malts, and you enjoy excellent value I think that you may be delighted."
Fort Collins Brewing,Z Lager,,,Rauchbier,5.40%,bottle,3.85,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,2/5/2010,"12 oz single from Total Wine, Perimeter, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Nice copper clarity in the body and some decent head and lace form in the pint glass. Looks nice. 
Carbonation is constant if not huge, but at the same time it is adequate.
Nose has a tiny bit of smoke but this is not a large presence. The main component seems to be a solid malt base.
The smoke is slightly more pronounced in the taste but it still remains fairly mild. The depth of smoke does not require food in the way that some other smoked beer do. Malts again come to the fore and the mouthfeel is quite silky. The aftertaste has a pleasing bitterness.
All on all very tasty and pleasing. low key bitterness and low key smoke but it works very well. Impressive."
The Bruery,Mischief,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,8.50%,bottle,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,2/4/2010,"$9.99 for the 750 mL bottle from Arbor Place Beverage, Douglasville, GA, USA.
Pour is is slightly darker than expected color with some nice looking head and lace. The beer lacks much clarity and is a darkish, honey-orange hue. (The final pour from the bottle into the Duvel tulip gets quite soup-like from the bottle conditioned sediment).
Nose has a significant hop aroma, and the tastes also have quite a hop forward presence. In that respect this beer is horribly mis-categorized as a Belgian Strong Pale and at the very least needs to be called a Belgian IPA. I would go as far as to say that the Belgian characteristics of yeast and candy are sufficiently absent to call this an American IPA. There's just not much ""Belgian"" about the taste of this beer at all. In that respect I'm horribly disappointed.
Hops are grassy and ""wet"" and highly aromatic. No too much bitterness and the beer ends with a sweetish flourish. Some mild grapefruit in the finish and the beer ends with a slight dry note and a bitter aftertaste. Mild burn.
Mouthfeel is OK.
Fine I guess, but Belgian Strong Pale? Absolutely not."
High & Mighty Beer Co.,Home For The Holidays,,,American Brown Ale,7.00%,bottle,3.48,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,1/30/2010,"22 oz offering from a brewery that I had a chance to try when I was in Boston and was impressed with. The hope here is that they will be coming to GA but this looks like a one-off special release with a larger distribution than normal.
Pour is a disappointing, drab looking brown with a serious lack of carbonation or life.
The nose and tastes give a slightly acidic, sweet and sour like affair which has me wondering if this beer has turned a bit. It's only a few weeks old and I do not see any dating on the bottle, and frankly it should be able to survive a few weeks of correct storage.
Despite the strange flavor profile the beer is actually quite drinkable. Almost a fruit note (which is pretty odd for the style) and some decent spruce like pine hops in the finish and aftertaste. No sign of any oak.
A little less American Brown and a touch more English character which suits my palate well."
Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,Sierra Nevada Glissade Golden Bock,,,Maibock / Helles Bock,6.40%,bottle,4.25,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,1/29/2010,"12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Usual SN presentation. Delighted to find a new SN beer that does NOT fit squarely into the ""large hopped IPA"" category! Hooray.
Classic pour with a high, if somewhat poorly retained head and little lace, on top of a great looking, golden body with tremendous clarity. Carbonation is perfect.
Malts hold the hop bitterness together nicely. A beer that perfectly showcases the crisp, sharp, bitter metallic notes of the hops in the style. Bitterness lingers nicely. Almost a slight medicinal aftertaste that fits well with the overall profile. A few grassy, organic notes which add to the feel of ""fresh"" in this beer.
Refreshing, sharp and clean, just about all you could ask from the flavor profile for a beer of this style.
Delightful, sharp and hits a drinkable note that few SN beers do for me - very pleased."
"Anheuser-Busch, Inc.",Michelob Ultra Lime Cactus,,,Light Lager,4.20%,bottle,1.83,2,2,1.5,2.5,2,1/24/2010,"Six pack brought by a guest for dinner. Well, it is what it is.
Slightly disconcerting, neon-like, fluorescent yellowish/green appearance. Urine comes to mind with an absolute clarity.
I was expecting a bigger nose and taste of lime but really it was quite muted. Flavors are not really offensive and with baking hot sun and circumstances that did not call for flavor, I suppose it would be possible to drink this, however I think a larger lime element might make it more palatable. As it is it's just a bland, sweetish macro effort with virtually no taste. Despite the lack of lime notes it still get's cloying and sweet very quickly.
Blast of carbonation that comes quickly and then disappears almost immediately. Zero head and zero retention.
Ho hum."

Poured into the Tucher Weizen glass the beer gives the requisite cloudiness but a darker-than-usual deep golden/orange butterscotch color. Head is OK, but lacks real density, retention and much lace. Disappointing would be harsh, but not the best looking Hefe by some distance.
Light banana greets the nose.
Carbonation seems about right, but the beer itself lacks a bit of depth. Not thin, but could do with an extra shot of wheat, yeasties in the final swirl. More pretty light banana and a touch of spice in the mix. Again muted.
No a big flavored Hefe by any stretch of the imagination. Not to say that I didn't enjoy it, but it's not a bold or especially fulsome beer."
De Proefbrouwerij (bvba Andelot),De Proef Signature Les Deux Brasseurs Ale (w/Jason Perkins),,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,8.50%,bottle,3.05,3,3,3,3.5,3,1/23/2010,"I've been eyeing this for months and finally pulled the trigger on the $13.99 corked and caged bottle from Green's on Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pours offers a cloudy, slightly watery looking light orange body and a decent rocky head. Some lacing but not the best I've seen. Appearance no the very best and I suspect that the beer will taste much better than it looks.
Nose has light acidity but seems quite sweet. The tastes reflect this. There's a lot of fruity sweetness that comes with the mild grapefruit. There's a surprising amount of sweetness here. The beer also begins to get slightly cloying which is about the last thing that I expected.
Yeasty and full in the mouth with even more sweetness.
I dunno, given the pedigree of this beer, and the price I was pretty disappointed in the final analysis. Lacked clean edges and ultimately came up short for me. The beer seemed a bit muddy and lacked significant definition."
Brouwerij Bosteels,DeuS (Brut Des Flandres),,,Bière de Champagne / Bière Brut,11.50%,bottle,4.03,4.5,4,4,4,4,1/18/2010,"2002 vintage from Cheers, Carrollton, GA, USA. $21.99 for the bottle, an excellent price considering the vintage and the general price for this beer. Just about the best bargain that one could hope for on Deus.
Heavy, heavy foil over the corked & caged bottle. Lots of gun smoke on opening, but not quite the pop or the gush that I was half-expecting. poured into champagne flutes the pour resembles a typical champagne with great cascading bubbles and that typical huge bubbly head that can get a little annoying after a few minutes. Eventually the beer settles down and we get to where we need to be. Some nice lace and very good, persistent carbonation. Color is a golden macro lager type that is darker than your typical sparkling wine.
Nose has some medicinal, sweetness and a strange, difficult to place herbal quality. 
Tastes are not really what I was expecting at all. I was anticipating a dry, champagne like experience and with perhaps some tartness. Perhaps not a Brute-like tartness but at least some semblance of white wine/sparkling dry character; there really was very little of this.
The beer drinks VERY sweetly to me - sweet as in sugary, not sweet as in S-W-E-E-T! There are quite a lot of apple and cider characteristics but they don't come with either the usual tart character or the dry nature of many, high quality beverages of this type. The missing dry notes, and the relatively missing yeast influence is quite surprising to me. 
The second half of the bottle was consumed after it had been sitting in an ice-bucket for some time, and as a result the carbonation seemed even more prickly than the firs half - to me, this was a good thing as it seemed to help the beer become drier and more well-defined. I think that temperature could be VERY important here and I might even look for a frosted glass! As we go down the bottle the sweetness gets a bit much - it never becomes cloying as such, but it is noticeable.
This IS a bottle which is between 7 and 8 years old so I might try a much younger bottle next time. For now, I'm a touch underwhelmed but I can see how this COULD be fantastic. I preferred Brute to this, but IT was really pretty tart. If we could reach a halfway house in between the two we'd have a really interesting beer.
Good, but for now I'm on the fence as to whether I would try this again. Next time ULTRA cold from the beginning and a younger bottle."

Very different to the current picture in the BA db. Thick glass with black foiled neck and neck label. Bottle has a confusing date. It literally says ""Bottled On"", 090414 which would suggest the 9th of April 2014, i.e about four years FROM now! I guess it must mean ""Best Before"" unless this beer WAS actually bottled 96 years ago!!
Mid-brown pour with some good clarity and plenty of persistent, fine carbonation. A thin film of froth forms on the surface of the beer but not much lace on the glass.
The smell has a very, very light acidic touch and a bit of dry fruit. Pretty reserved though.
Very little acidity in the beer. Not much fruit either, and in the final analysis the beer drinks in a very neutral manner. Tastes a little like a base of sodium hydrogen carbonate solution to which a very small amount of light fruit has been added. The finish gives a touch more slight, tartness but hardly a trace.
The lightest of light Flanders Reds and a good introduction that could be describes as somewhat atypical but at the same time might be accessible for newcomers to the style."
Founders Brewing Company,Founders Centennial IPA,,,American IPA,7.20%,bottle,3.88,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,1/18/2010,"12 oz stubbie in the usual Founders presentation. Founders came to Georgia this week and I've had plenty before, but I've never reviewed this. Seemed like a good idea to crack on with this beer this evening.
Mid orange pour with a touch of cloudiness. Head is not huge, nor is the retention great but the lace is very good with a real sticky nature.
Pretty green, grassy hop aroma is the simple nose. Not massive, but clear and clean in its presence and without pretense. It is what it is.
The grassy nature is forward in the taste. Plenty of ""C"" hop character but it never gets aggressive in the slightest. Very balanced and reserved. It also drinks below the 7.20%. The bitterness and hops do come into play a touch more in the finish and aftertaste but it's still straightforward and non pretentious.
Solid and tasty hop-forward beer without being typically, US aggressive."
Gordon Biersch Brewery Restaurant,Gordon Biersch Czech Style Pilsner,,,Czech Pilsener,5.30%,on-tap,3.1,4,3,3,3.5,3,1/18/2010,"The usual GB experience with this beer.
Clean lines define the look of the brew, true to style with nice clarity on the pour and some very good, persistent carbonation. The beer looks good with the golden body and most importantly a well retained head that produces some nice lace.
The one thing that the beer lacks is a serious Saaz like bite in the finish. There are two ways to look at this. On the plus side for the establishment it's probably brewed in that manner to keep it approachable for the non-beer types which make up the majority of GB customers so it makes sense; BUT on the other hand it takes it away from a typical, authentic version of the style and as a result really seriously detracts from the one of my main reasons for drinking a Pils! In short, makes sense for GB but doesn't work too well for me.
Still non-offensive but a little too basic for me."
Gordon Biersch Brewery Restaurant,Hefeweizen,,,Hefeweizen,?,on-tap,2.23,3.5,2.5,2,2.5,2,1/18/2010,"In a nutshell this is a lackluster Hefe, which, much like the GB Pils at the same establishment is somewhat true to style but seems to have all of the important attributes and elements toned down.
Sure there is a cloudy yellow body, and sure there are a few clove like notes as well, but the mouthfeel is weak and the beer feels overall quite watery - in my book the cardinal sin for a Hefe.
It's as if the beer has been deliberately taken down a notch or two, perhaps because the majority of the clientele wouldn't appreciate or like the full force Hefe?
I dunno, ultimately disappointing and this is not a beer that i would recommend trying at the GB chain. They make some good, respectable beers but this is not one of them.
Non-offensive, but pretty weak."
the Nils Oscar Company,Nils Oscar Rökporter,,,Smoked Beer,5.90%,bottle,3.98,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,1/16/2010,"500 mL bottle fro Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
I enjoy a smoked porter, especially in the winter months and if smoke s going to work in a beer at all, a porter is a great style to match up with the ashes.
Lovely black body with plenty of brown/red highlights. Mocha head is high early, retention and lace are good. Solid.
Nose and and tastes give some noticeable, lactose like milkiness. Smoke pushes the milk sugar away and the sweetness drops off to give a nice, authentic porter flavor. Smoke lingers a touch in the aftertaste. Lightly roasted notes in the malts. Simple and restrained - not too aggressive.
Mouthfeel is relatively thin and does not deliver a punch. Disappointing might be a little harsh, but it certainly comes up a bit short in terms of complexity and richness in the mouth.
Tasty and solid. I liked Left Hand's Smokejumper better in recent months, but this is still solid, enjoyable and a decent example. Just needs a touch more noisy, depth."
Birrificio Montegioco,Demon Hunter,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,8.50%,bottle,3.6,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,1/10/2010,"750 mL bottle, paper wrapped as in the BA database picture. Pretty impressive presentation. $15.99 from Arbor Place Beverage, Douglasville, GA, USA. Cap has an extra plastic appendage on the underside and it comes off with some force.
Pour is a very attractive, orange copper color with some excellent creamy head, with persistent, spotty coverage on the surface of the beer and some nice lace. Head characteristics (in terms of retention) are especially pleasing.
Somewhat musty, light sherry notes appear early in the nose. A touch of alcohol too.
Tastes have a lots of caramel based notes but the large sweetness that usually follows such a start in the style, does not materialize. Rather we get a sudden bitter, dry taste plus some very distinct herbal notes. The earthy bitterness lingers and holds off the blast of sweetness that I am expecting all the way through to the finish - it just never comes! Light, warming alcohol in the finish as well and a little more herbal character.
Enjoyable but definitely NOT a typical, Belgian Strong Dark. There is an absence of dark fruits, a definite serious lack of sugary sweetness, some missing alcohol and some herbal hop-based bitterness that one would not expect. Having said all of that, I WAS expecting something different given the origin - these Italian beers are a law onto themselves and they reflect some interesting taste profiles.
Perhaps more Dubbel like in the final analysis.
Well, interesting but I really prefer a classic BDSA. Has some interesting herbal qualities which I general i like, but it doesn't quite come together for me. Like many of these Italian offerings, whilst I have enjoyed some of them, I have also found them to be poor value for money."

Fairly non-descript in the final analysis.
Nice orange colored pour with some excellent head, lace and retention. Head is a noticeable white with high pillowing and quite fluffy. A touch of hazy in the body.
Nose and tastes are muted in terms of hops which pretty much matches the style, but the malt profile seems a little on the low side to me. A grassy, hay-like linger taste finishes the beer.
Very non-offensive which may be a euphemism for ""bland"", but to be honest that would be unfair - it's a better bee than that would suggest.
Good crossover potential and the organic angle might pull a few in to the party too. Worth a shot, and I could certainly have a couple more if they were offered."
Abita Brewing Co.,Christmas Ale 2009,,,American Amber / Red Ale,?,bottle,3.75,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,1/8/2010,"12 oz stubbie, the usual Abita and Christmas presentation. Single from Mac's, Atlanta, GA, USA. Best Before 05/01/2010 on the neck.
Pour is an attractive copper body with some nice white head that shows decent retention and some sticky lace. Good clarity. Looks nice.
Nice malty nose with a hint of hops.
Quite dry in the finish despite the obvious malts up front. There is something distinct about Abita beers and I'm not sure if it's a particular yeast strain or hop profile but it seems to cut across a number of their beers.
Plenty of light nut notes followed by a controlled hop bitterness that adds the dry finish. Bitterness lingers somewhat with some metallic character. There is almost a fresh, organic, grassy, wet hop note in there too.
As usual, nothing earth shattering here but a decent example of the style and quite drinkable. This really is not a ""Christmas"" ale by many measures but still drinkable and enjoyable."
Magic Hat Brewing Company,Odd Notion (Winter 09),,,American Wild Ale,4.50%,bottle,2.83,3,3,2.5,3.5,3,1/8/2010,"12 oz single.
Magic Hat certainly makes some ""Odd"" beer and this one certainly fits into the series - literally!
Pour produces a pretty nice, pillow like head that sits on top of a not particularly attractive, murky, dirty brown body. Not much retention but at least some sticky lace.
Nose gives away a sort of sweet and sour whiff.
The aroma is actually how I would describe the taste of this beer too - definitely a sweet and sour affair. Some fruitiness as well and then an extra dash of low-level tart in the finish. The beer is clearly NOT anything like many (or even any) other American Wild Ales as it gives a strange sweetness among the slight tart flavor, and there certainly isn't a normal, wild, brett function anywhere. Some expression of green apples but certainly not ""sour"" or ""funky"" in the classic sense.
A ""Wild Ale"" for the masses perhaps? As such it's not really a Wild Ale at all!
I thought it was OK to drink 12 oz of, but I wouldn't visit it again nor would I compare this to just about anything else in the category. 
More strange stuff from magic Hat, but that's what I've come to expect. Weird."

Pour is a good looking black with a few brownish highlights. Head is initially nice and creamy but the retention and lace are both very poor even when considering the ABV. Marked down for that.
A nice rich nose with some light roastiness, some chocolate and a touch of alcohol. Considering the word ""Belgian"" is used in the name of the beer and the label, the beer lacks much of a Belgian yeast element.
The tastes reflect the lack of Belgian character for me. On the plus side it is fairly light and drinkable despite the fact that the alcohol is definitely present. It drinks nicely with more than a touch of warming alcohol and some smooth, easy drinking chocolate notes. More warming alcohol in the finish too. A lack of Belgian character and a strange, lingering bitterness in the finish subtract from the experience somewhat.
One of the better Side Projects for me, but still nothing to write home about for me. Seems to me like the beer is trying too hard."
McAuslan Brewing,St-Ambroise 20th Anniversary Vintage Ale (2009),,,English Barleywine,9.80%,bottle,3.6,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,1/2/2010,"11.5 oz bottle in the cardboard sleeve and plastic cap.
Interesting beer. Firstly there is an appearance that is reminiscent of one of the classic, English Pale Ales with superb sticky, white lace and a dark, honey orange body. The head and lace are very good. Could be classic, cask Pale Ale from the look. The sticky nature of the lace reminds me a little of a West Coast DIPA but it is really quite, white.
Nose has some very sweet, light malt notes with a very subtle, light undertone of alcohol. All of the nose characteristics are carried forward to the taste and there is a really light, subtle touch to this beer. There is a hint of hoppy bitterness in the final wave which although NOT strong, still gives away a serious departure from a classic English Barleywine.
Finishes with a malty blast and a caramel smoothness. Alcohol is very well hidden, although the aftertaste gives me a little more than I wanted.
This beer is NOT typical of an English Barleywine in as much as it is not really sweet and it does not give many sherry-like notes. Interesting, since it seems to combine several characteristics from a number of styles but ultimately not something I am likely to want to go back to."

Pour is a fairly authentic looking body with a cloudy, hazed orange appearance. Head is large to start with but both the retention and lace are rather poor. Carbonation seems way too low, and this seriously detracts from the beer.
The beer has some decent banana notes with a touch of pineapple. The finish is a bit bitter and the beer ends with life or much interest. The wheat is very slight and the whole thing is rather uninteresting.
I had some high hopes for this but in the final analysis it really isn't a very good beer. Not bad, and fairly inoffensive but with so many better options for the style omething I m unlikely to go back to."
Mayflower Brewing Company,Mayflower Thanksgiving Ale,,,American Strong Ale,8.00%,bottle,3,4,3.5,3,3.5,2,12/31/2009,"22 oz bottle coutesy of DrDogBeer as part of Secret Santa '09. Thanks Tom.
The label says that this is an American take on an English Old Ale - should be interesting.
Pour is a very nice, chestnut body with some good clarity. Head, lace and retention are minimal, but largely as expected with the 8.00% ABV tag.
Nose and tastes give the same, slightly odd mixture. The beer starts with plenty of malts, and a really quite distinct nutty character but as it drinks the hop character comes more to the fore leading to a fairly dry finish. The finish also gives some more alcohol and a few dry sherry notes. Aftertaste is surprisingly bitter with some degree of metal. There's a hint of brown ale base as well. Light vanilla.
Ultimately I'm really not sure about this. I winds up sort of in nomansland with a nice malty start and then a far-too-hoppy-for-the-old-ale-style ending. It never gets to American Strong territory either, and to me the beer is a touch unsatisfying in the way it's not really being one thing or another.
I dunno, this just ends up in between too many flavor profiles to sit well with me. Too much of mish-mash."
Red Brick Brewing Company,Laughing Skull Amber Ale,,,American Amber / Red Ale,5.70%,bottle,3.65,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,12/30/2009,"12 oz bottle, completely new and different beer from the old, Czech/Bohemian Pils affair.



As is sometimes the case, an interesting turn of events lead me to pick this beer up for the first time; I grab one in a mixed sixer at Mac's and then head downtown to meet Wes at Cypress for a quick lunchtime pint. Low and behold, ABC's Chris is at the bar and he pulls a couple for me - thanks Chris, you're very kind.



The story behind the new beer is that it was born out of a combo/blend that some guys have been doing at the brewery called a ""dirty blond(e)"", where they have been mixing the brown and the blonde for sometime. The Vortex guys thought this was a good concept to re-launch the Laughing Skull beer under, and so the completely new beer was born under the old name. From what Chris was telling me, essentially we get the brown malt base and then the beer is created from that point.



Pour is a mid-orange body with excellent clarity. Head is not huge but it does leave some lace and some spotty retention on the surface of the brew.



Nose is a very, very distinct soapy affair with the hops being a little medicinal. The soap aspect was quite strong for me. 



Tastes are sweet from the initial malt base but are backed up quickly with a very clean, crisp almost ""lager-like"" finish. In that respect, it's somewhat unusual for an amber ale in as much as the beer feels dry in the second half in a way that a typical amber ale may not. The aftertastes have some biscuity, English malts and the beer is without question pretty clean. It feels ""sessionable"" in terms of its drinkability, but without knowing the precise ABV it's obviously impossible to specifically categorize it that way.



It's tasty and I enjoyed it, but obviously this is NOT ground-breaking in any way, however it does show that ABC is really beginning to think about what they are doing and is making a really conscience effort to step up and make stuff happen. In that respect I applaud their efforts."
Red Brick Brewing Company,Red Brick 15th Anniversary,,,American Brown Ale,?,bottle,3.95,4,4,4,3.5,4,12/29/2009,"22 oz bottle adorned with an impressive gold foil top. Unusual to see Atlanta Brewing putting it out there in a few different ways; bombers, foiled, bourbon-aged, anniversary offering, transparent label, special release etc.
Nice clarity on the reddish-brown pour with a flimsy white head that breaks up quickly. Some watery lace and some legs when we swirl it.
Nose is strong with alcoholic vanilla coming to the fore.
Tastes are all vanilla bourbon dominated, but the power is restrained and not overwhelming. Bourbon-aged beers are really not my thing, but this one is somewhat controlled and drinks very nicely. Light to medium body which is true to the brown ale base. Light burn of alcohol and bourbon up front, but then a dry element kicks in, which, CONVERSELY does NOT reflect the usual malty, sweetish aspects of a typical brown ale. The finish reiterates the bourbon, vanilla and alcohol and it lingers slightly.
Tasty beer and this type of beer isn't usually really my thing, so I would say this is a pretty good example. Drinkability is good with some warming character but everything is in check. I like the restraint - it makes for a better drinking experience than many bourbon influenced brews."
Allagash Brewing Company,Allagash Burnham Road,,,Smoked Beer,8.00%,on-tap,3.9,4,4,4,4,3.5,12/28/2009,"On tap at The Brick Store.
Interesting beer as it would appear that this is one of the few Allagash beers that steers away from your typical Belgian inspired styles and goes down a ""road"" that I was not expecting from them.
Darkish, golden pour with excellent head, lace and retention. packaged in the Allagash flute/tulip, the beer holds its own nicely in the glass.
Nose and tastes give a light smoke with plenty of peat in the background. it threatens to get quite strong but somehow is held together with some sweeter malts. the malt base seems surprisingly strong for a bee of this kind but it comes together nicely.
Plenty to be happy about here, but as with many smoked beers if you are going to consume any kind of quantity it really needs to be paired with food. Even after my relatively small glass, I wasn't exactly ""tiring"" of the taste, but I had enjoyed plenty. Drinkability is not superb, even though the beer is very good.
Interesting, delighted to have tried it."

Right off the top, I think this should be categorized as an English Pale (at least in the way it drinks).
WOW! A revelation. Obviously I went into this with some severe trepidation but came out amazed!
The pour is a crystal clear, orangey/macro color with some limited head but surprising sticky lace.
Nose is pretty neutral, but it gives away some simple malt-like notes.
The tastes are AMAZING when you consider the nature of the beer. There is a lot of tangerine, orange and sweetened grapefruit, a VERY clean finish and a lingering hop bitterness that HONESTLY reminds me of some of the better, casked, highly-hopped English Pale Ales.
Mouthfeel is where things go south, but if you can imagine a super, crisp, English Pale with a decent amount of thirst-quenching qualities, then you can get a handle on this beer.
I am actually going to purchase this again as a ""normal"" beer.
Truly amazing when you consider the lack of malts."
"The Tap / Haverhill Brewery, Inc",La Dame De Peronne,,,Bière de Garde,7.00%,bottle,3.2,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,12/27/2009,"22 oz bottle from DrDogBeer as part of Secret Santa 2009. Thanks Tom.
Pour gives a chestnut brown color with a vivid, lively look. Good clarity and some decent head, lace and retention. The beer looks inviting.
This brew is all about a complicated array of malts with some hop presence in the finish. There are a lot of competing sweet malts jostling for attention, and in the end I feel it gets a bit muddled. Too complicated in the malt department.
The other dominating feature is the earthy, almost peat like taste. It's NOT smoked, but the organic, soil like character seems to cloud the clarity of the beer. Very prominent and it's not a funk based thing at all - muddy!
It drinks OK, and I am not saying that I did not like the beer, but it's a little too crowded in terms of tastes and experiences for me. The beer does not drink very cleanly at all, and for me that's a bit of a problem."

Pour is a miserable looking, pale, insipid off-yellow cloudy (almost beige) affair that looks worryingly weak in terms of body, head, retention and lace.
The nose and tastes reflect the look, and frankly remind me of old dishwater. Both aspects of the beer are horribly washed out, almost as if one (or more) ingredients had been left out! The citrus and yeast elements seem as if they have been (literally) watered down. At first I suspected that this would all change once I swirled the yeast from the bottom of the bottle, and if act I ended up inverting the 2/3 full bottle several times to attempt to improve things. The change was minimal and beer beer remained washed-out in all aspects.
Watery and lacking any depth, the mouthfeel fails to redeem the disappointing tastes. 
This was so poor that I was beginning to wonder if the beer had a perhaps gone through a problem in production where insufficient attention had been given to the bottle-conditioning. Without a batch number or date on the bottle, that's obviously impossible to follow-up on.
Anyway, my experience here was awful, I hope that yours will be better."
Ridgeway Brewing,Foreign Export Stout,,,Foreign / Export Stout,8.00%,bottle,4.85,4,5,5,4,5,12/26/2009,"WOW! Extraordinary. I wasn't expecting this. 500 mL bottle, Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
I didn't bother to check the ABV or anything about this beer before I cracked it, and as a result I got quite a shock.
Pour is jet black (some reddish highlights at the extremes) with a small head and not much retention or lace. There is a spotty, creamy film on the surface of the beer.
The nose reveals some amazing, light sherry notes with beautiful, subtle roasted creamy bursts of depth.
The flavors reflect the nose with more sherry and a really, really subtle alcohol presence. The 8.00 ABV is a revelation when you find it. Subtle, creamy and subtle again. WOW! Beautiful notes of simple roast malts and sweetness. The sheery notes repeat themselves over and over again with more in the finish and aftertaste. Simple beautiful. 
Subtle notes of an English Barleywine linger here as well. Stunning and surprising."
The Lost Abbey,Witch's Wit,,,Witbier,4.80%,bottle,2.1,2,3,2,1,2,12/26/2009,"Delighted to get to try this one, courtesy of DrDogBeer (Tom) - many thanks. 750 mL bottle, usual Lost Abbey, corked & caged presentation.
The opening of the beer is disappointing. A worryingly, uninspired lack of pop - oh, oh, this is Lost Abbey after all - problems??
The beer pours with a bright orange, honey colored, murky body. Head is absent and as a result, as is lace and retention. 
Carbonation is the problem here. The beer is flat and this (I guess) is another Lost Abbey issue. Zero carbonation and therefore almost zero mouthfeel.
Nose and tastes give plenty of wheat and the yeast gives a German character for me. These are the dominating features, but there is an absence of spice, coriander, orange or much else. Very disappointing.
In the final analysis the carbonation problem screws the whole beer and maybe with a correction this would be better, but for now the beer is on hold for me.
Lost Abbey are all over the place - stunningly brilliant to utter crap. Quality control is obviously a HUGE issue."
Brouwerij De Dolle Brouwers,De Dolle Extra Export Stout,,,Foreign / Export Stout,9.00%,bottle,3.48,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,12/25/2009,"11.2 oz bottle. Into the Westmalle chalic eit goes.
This is at least two years old, but to be honest it's impossible to tell the real age; could be even older. Quite a lot of sediment from the dregs of the bottle and a large amount of yeasty, marmite debris around the top of the bottle and underneath the cap.
Body is dark, dark brown approaching opaque. Creamy mocha head with a nice spotty film on the surface of the beer.
Nose gives a slightly acidic, lactose like whiff.
Mouthfeel is a little thin, I would prefer something a little more substantial.
Tastes give some light smoke/roast with a lactose type acidity. The roast is quite gentle and the beer gives a sherry note in the finish. Lingering, musty bitterness in the finish which also gives that sightly oxidized, musty taste. Considering the ABV the alcohol is fairly well hidden.
I'm doubtful as to the benefit of aging this. I'd really like to experience this fresh and near the source, I have a feeling I would like it better than this."
Ithaca Beer Company,Brute,,,American Wild Ale,6.50%,bottle,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,12/25/2009,"750 mL bottle, gold foiled and corked. Adorned with gold labels. Presentation is superb. Batch E! 018.
Poured this one into champagne flutes.
The pour gives a golden yellow body with a champagne like carbonation which is all very attractive.
The nose gives that distinct, dry yeast aroma with some hint of the sour notes to come.
Having read some reviews for this I was expecting a puckeringly sour, vinegar like concoction, but this was simply not my experience. Sure there was quite a lot of sour acidity, but in no way was in as sour as many had suggested. Lots of green apple acidity and the carbonation was definitely sparkling-wine ""like"", but the dry character came through and the beer drank beautifully. I get very little oak, which I am happy about - the beer doesn't need that added complexity for me.
More, lovely dry, yeast notes in the finish and the beer finishes amazingly well. Very tasty with plenty of moreish notes and the acidity does not grate.
Very classy beer from presentation through to finish, and one that you could easily impress people with. Delicious and a great aperitif or greeting beer. Might be even better classified as a Biere de Champagne."
The Lost Abbey,Carnevale,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,6.50%,bottle,4.58,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,12/25/2009,"750 mL corked & caged bottle from DrDogBeer as part of my Secret Santa 2009 gift - thanks Tom.
Beer opend with an ecouraging pop, and the reqisite gun smoke.
Pour is a hazed, tangerine body with a lovely fluffy, well-retained head with lots of lace.
Silky and smooth in the mouth wiht a pleasing fullness.
Nose and tastes give a magnificent wave of (initially) lemongrass but followed very quickly by some light, semi-sweetened grapefruit and a small, but significant does of funk. The funk is reserved but very much a significant part of the experience. As one would expect a combination of light esters, medicinal hoppy/herbal notes and the light acidity of a great Saison. Very nicely put together.
Delicious example of the style, and something (see Red Barn) that Lost Abbey obviously has an ability to produce and do well.
Drinkability for me is huge, and the bottle is gone in no time. I really wanted to sit and gulp this down."

Pour is close to black with a nicely formed, solid looking head.
Nose gives some significant fruit notes which are much deeper than a traditional Wit.
Plenty of continued fruit in the nose and more than a touch of alcohol too. Nice bubble gum and spiced, sweet Belgian candy too. Esters present.
Creamy mouthfeel (obviously from the wheat)."

Pretty interesting beer this one, not really my cup of tea but a few extra things to report.
Pour is an impressive, garnet one with nice clarity and a better head than one would expect from the style and the ABV. Even some retention and lace.
Initially the nose gives away little other than the standard hop-forward alcohol that one would anticipate for the style...but....
...as it warms it gets more interesting. I got this incredible, tannin, tea-like aroma and taste that I could NOT shake. It got stronger as the beer went on and even manifested itself in the finish with a puckeringly dry note that one would get from well-stewed tea. Obviously there are the American style hops, the alcohol and all the usual stuff going on in the tastes, but the tea element was very strong for me.
Anyway, because of the tea (and the look) I enjoyed this beer more than I thought I would. Worth a shot for the novelty."
Weyerbacher Brewing Co.,Riserva,,,American Wild Ale,11.40%,bottle,1.98,3.5,1.5,2,3,1.5,12/24/2009,"&#8206;750 mL corked & caged bottle that opens with a small pop. A little gun smoke and some fizzy head.&#8206;
Pour is an extraordinary, murky, strawberry colored body with a thin film of head and some residual &#8206;lace.&#8206;
Massive (and I mean massive) vinegar and ethanoic acid gets straight into the nostrils with a &#8206;vengeance. WOW, sinus clearing and quite violent.&#8206;
Tastes are slightly more reserved, but not quite as acidic nature of the beer overwhelms just about &#8206;everything its path. There is some fruit in there, but it is forced to take a backseat to the red wine &#8206;vinaigrette which makes up the bulk of this beer.
This is an extraordinary brew, that in the final analysis I really can't stomach very much of. Sours are &#8206;fine, and I have enough experience to deal with them but this ""beer"" is a total law unto itself. It is &#8206;LITERALLY reminiscent of a vinaigrette salad dressing, and if this WERE salad dressing I think I would like &#8206;it; as a beer it defies even the most robust and experienced palates.&#8206; on the plus side alcohol is pretty well hidden although there is a mild burn in the back end, but I expect this is just the acid. Reminded me of some rubbing alcohol and a dreadful blackberry vinegar that my dad used to make for treating colds - nasty! A touch of wood too which confuses the beer further.
Aggressive is not really the word, rather it's a monumental attack on the senses and not in a &#8206;particularly good way. HARSH, pass me the iceberg lettuce.&#8206;"
The Bruery,Rugbrød,,,Rye Beer,8.00%,bottle,3.68,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,12/23/2009,"750 mL bottle from Arbor Place Beverage, Douglasville, GA, USA.
I approach this with some trepidation since I am not the biggest fan of rye beer in general.
Pour is a very good looking, chocolate brown body with a solid, dense, well formed head with good retention and lace.
Nose is medicinal, clean and semi-sweet.
Not a great deal of rye in the taste, which for me is a good thing. Plenty of baker's chocolate/cocoa with some mild rye in the finish. Aftertaste gives more chocolate. Mouthfeel gives some lively carbonation and a mild prickle which more me adds to the experience.
As it warms we get a little more alcohol.
I doubt this will satisfy those looking for a big rye fix, bt for me it was fine."
Fort Collins Brewing,Big Shot,,,American Brown Ale,6.50%,bottle,3.13,4.5,3,3,3.5,3,12/22/2009,"22 oz bottle.
Nice clarity om the pour to yield a red/bronze body. Some good, ice-cream dollop type head and some impressive lace. Solid looking.
Nose is a little soapy and reveals the larger than necessary hop character that follows. 
Dry, cocoa notes and bakers chocolate with a dose of greenish hops that seem a bit out of place in the Brown category for me. Finishes with more dry notes. The chocolate comes back in the aftertaste.
A bit ""green"" for me, this beer gives a bit of a fresh hop presence when it really ought to be rounded out with a sweeter note IMO. A bit edgy and slightly too bitter for the style.
OK, looks good but he experience doesn't quite hit it for me."
Brasserie De La Senne / De Zenne Brouwerij,X-Mas Zinnebir,,,Belgian Pale Ale,6.50%,bottle,3.6,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,12/21/2009,"330 mL bottle from Green's on Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA. $3.99 for the chance to try this.
Errr....Belgian Pale (as per current BA db designation), NO. Much more like a Brune.
Head and lace a quite poor and the body is a chestnut, deep brown.
Nose has a lot if peppery yeast.
Lots of pear and pineapple in the taste (along with a few other esters) which give the impression that the beer is going to be very fruity, however the character changes right at the end and in the finish and aftertaste. There is very surprising level of bitterness which kicks in. A hoppy, dry bitterness which seems very out of place. On the plus side the bitterness does not linger and the final flourish is an ethereal, fruity, slighly bubble-gum inspired blast.
Tricky beer that is difficult to pin down, but tasty and somewhat surprising."
Brauerei Pinkus Mueller,Organic Pinkus Jubilate,,,Munich Dunkel Lager,5.50%,bottle,4.45,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,12/21/2009,"I've passed on this a few times but pulled the trigger last week at Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour is a hearty looking, mid-brown body with some nice frothy head. Lace is great. Lovely looking.
Nose and tastes give a touch of acidity followed by lots of light malts and yeasty goodness. Flavorful and happily moderate with the ABV, there is plenty of German malt and yeast character here. Culminates with some nice, rounded aftertastes and a light, biscuity malt touch in the finish which is often reserved for English beers.
Extremely tasty and a delightfully light touch. Super beer that I could drink year-round."
Harpoon Brewery,Harpoon Chocolate Stout,,,American Stout,5.90%,growler,3,3.5,4.5,2.5,2,3,12/21/2009,"Many thanks to DrDogBeer for the chance to try this as part of 2009 Secret Santa.
Shared at The Brick Store.
Pour is a fairly standard, mid-chocolate brown color with a better than expected head. Retention and lace are OK, not great, but OK.
Nose is deinitely the strongest aspect of this beer wih a great, truly rich chocolate aroma coming from the glass even without much agitation. Very strong - very nice.
Frankly, after that, things go downhill quite a lot. The beer is a little acidic and lacks any kind of mouth presence. Very thin and I might even say watery. I am NOT confusing this a being a bigger stout either, even by the standards of ""normal"", lower ABV stouts the beer seems somewhat insipid.
Tastes produce the choclate malt character that one expects but it is nowhere near the intensity promised in the nose and frankly they are disappointing. Not much of anything present in the tase in the way of alcohol or hops either.
Looks OK, smells great but drinks poorly. That about sums it up."

22 oz bottle. May 2009 bottling, Batch Five.
Delightful, cloudy orange pour with a super head, retention and lace. Lovely.
Dry in the nose with some very light white pepper, but to be honest the nose is not this beers' strength.
Tastes are those of light citrus marmalade and then some increased (compared to the nose) white pepper. Plenty of gentle herb and medicinal like hop presence and a sweeter-than-one-would expect finish. Like all good Saison's some moreish aftertastes. VERY light grapefruit in the back end; some spice notes.
Light and drinkable, the mouthfeel is one that one craves with some simple, light carbonation.
Very nice effort from a (relatively) fledgling brewery that I will be keeping an optimistic eye on."

Pour is a surprisingly dark, bronze color. Must be using some darker malts. Head is good and the lace is superb.
Aggressive, Saaz based, alcoholic nose.
The tastes give the same aggressive hops. The tastes are bitter with a metallic edge and a lingering finish. The malt backbone is VERY substantial and to be honest it reminds me a little of DFH 120. The hop aroma is quite strong and reminiscent of a DIPA.
As expected the alcohol gives the beer a slightly syrupy, viscous, cloying mouthfeel, but frankly this is exactly as expected for the ABV and the style. Nothing to rpert there, really.
Really a DIPA with lager yeast."
Flying Fish Brewing Company,Exit 1,,,Foreign / Export Stout,7.00%,bottle,3.85,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,12/20/2009,"Cracked this one at The Brick Store on a Friday lunchtime.
Simple pour with standard black body and nice, mocha head.
A very light drinking stout. Influence from the oysters? Maybe, but if there is an character at all it manifest in the light nature of the beer.
Mouthfeel is approaching thin, but it doesn't seem to detract from the experience at all. Perhaps a mild salty, brine element amongst the water, but to be honest this may be just a function of the mind playing tricks on the palate knowing that the oysters are in there. A very light touch on the roasted malts and the hop character is extremely reserved.
Reminded me a LOT of a typical, low ABV English Stout in the way that it drank.
As a result of the light touch, and the absence of any alcohol presence, this one was very refreshing for a stout, and also had excellent drinkability. tasty beer ad one that was extremely light on its feet. Nice."
Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),Samuel Adams Utopias,,,American Strong Ale,27.00%,bottle,4.55,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,5,12/19/2009,"2007 Vintage.
Pour is an oily looking, fairly light brown liquid which gives astonishing ""legs"" in the glass. That, and the searing alcoholic nose, give the game away in terms of the ABV. A touch viscous in the mouth, but what the hell were you expecting??
The nose is simple to place for me. It reminds me of a Harvey's Bristol Cream Sherry. In fact, that, and the tastes which are almost identical, make this basically a sherry to me. It does have more alcohol presence than a normal fortified wine, but it is sweeter. There is a mild caramel note and some extra brown sugar on top but not much else. A drier finish than one might expect from the initial sweetness.
Delicious, moreish, mellow, sweet and alcohol laden, but to me not especially complex. Nor is this ""beer"" by any stretch of the imagination. Yes, I know the process and the ""formal"" categorization puts it there, but this simply isn't a beer when it comes to the drinking experience.
I REALLY, REALLY enjoyed it, but to call it anything other than a fortified wine of some description is largely meaningless - that's the experience you will get when you drink it regardless of the official designation.
$150-$200 a bottle? I dunno, that's really pushing it for me, especially when I can get largely the same warming alcohol experience from a number of other Sherry, Port and Madeira beverages. Still ""exceptional"" in many ways and a very, very enjoyable and tasty tipple, but to me we've moved out of beer and into an entirely different realm."
Brouwerij Van Honsebrouck N.V.,St. Louis Gueuze Fond Tradition,,,Gueuze,5.00%,bottle,3.53,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,12/19/2009,"Mini-champagne, green glass, dimpled bottom and gold foiled neck. Green's on Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Light, honey colored body with some nice dense head and some pretty good retention and even a touch of lace. Some spotty head on the surface.
Nose is a standard, lightly sinus clearing acidity with green apples.
Obviously a pretty acidic profile with a lively, highly carbonate mouthfeel which adds to the experience. Finish is fairly short, clean and shows some sodium hydrogen carbonate. Strangely, after a while it gets a bit watery in the back end.
As is often the case with these brews, the acidic fades as the beer warms and the whole thing mellows out as the bottle is consumed.
A long way from the best example of the style, but nevertheless enjoyable and good value."
Victory Brewing Company,Yakima Glory,,,American Black Ale,8.70%,bottle,3.53,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,12/18/2009,"12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Heard various descriptions of this, including ""Black Pale Ale"" (which I cannot abide) so I was interested (and anxious) to see what this looked like before anything else.
The beer pours with a deep, granet, reddish hue with great clarity. Nice head and lace considering the ABV, it looks good in the glass. 
Semi-sweet nose with some sinus clearing, tea-like hops.
Tastes are obviously hop-forward and quite dry, but there is a degree of balanced sweetness which helps level it out a bit. Don't get me wrong, this is still a mightyly UNbalanced beer, but the malts are at least present to help it along a bit. The finish seems VERY, VERY green and raw. The green nature of the flavor is the linger feature.
As far as the mouthfeel goes, the beer is relatively thin and lacks much viscosity.
A poor man's Arrogant Bastard? Not as sweet or as smooth, but reminds me of it a little, especially the apperance.
Not really my cup of tea and not really very approachable, but at the same time it wasn't as bad as it could have been - that's about the best I can say."

Lovely honey colored, clouded pour and a very noce initial, light, frothy head. Retention and lace aren't great, but still acceptable.
Nose and tastes reveal muted alcohol, muted white pepper and muted Belgian sweetness (candy). A light spice note is there too. Yeasty finsh completes the picture.
Very light, easy drinking.
In a nutshell, a poor man's Duvel with similar appearance but a lot less depth. Perhaps a touch harsh on the beer as it is not trying to emulate Duvel as far as I can tell (with the lower ABV and the regular Pale rather than Strong Pale categorizaton), but one can't help but make comparisons. If you fancy a lighter touch than Duvel then this would be a good option."
Southampton Publick House,Southampton Imperial Baltic Porter,,,Baltic Porter,7.50%,bottle,2.98,3.5,3,3,2.5,3,12/17/2009,"12 oz single, Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Given that Southampton is a brewer that I have great respect for, and this is one of my favorite styles, I have to say that I was ultimately really disappointed in this.
Color and pour were promising. Perhaps not the depth of head formation or retention, but acceptable. Chestnut brown.
The nose was an unusual bready combination which seemed a bit out of place. It almost seemed O'fest in its character.
Tastes have some more odd, lager characteristics. Some highish yeasty notes and a little too hop-forward for my liking too. Mouthfeel is nowhere near where it needs to be for the style - weak.
I dunno, not a good example of the style for me, which was surprising consider my usual enjoyment of Southampton."
Deschutes Brewery,Mirror Mirror,,,English Barleywine,11.00%,bottle,4.33,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,12/16/2009,"Thanks go out to Lance for securing this bottle for me. Took me an age to get hold of it, but eventually it got here.
22 oz bottle with the black wax. Shared this one with Wes at Cypress, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour is a simple, reddish hue with good clarity and a surprisingly healthy, frothy and large bubbled head. 
Nose gives light brown sugar and some alcohol.
This is a VERY smooth, restrained and rounded version of the style. Usually I'm not a huge fan of the hop-based American versions of BW's, nor am I much of a fan of any kind of oak, but this combo really melds VERY well. It's my suspicion that over the last few months this may have evened-out some. There is a really large and continuing sugary note which makes the huge ABV and any oak notes that would be otherwise be potentially harsh, round out nicely.
Very surprised how rounded this was and how much I enjoyed it. Drinkability is very high when you consider the style."
De Proefbrouwerij (bvba Andelot),Van Twee (w/ John Mallett),,,Belgian Dark Ale,7.50%,bottle,4.03,4.5,4,4,4,4,12/13/2009,"750 mL corked & caged bottle, plastic cork (I hate those), $13.99 from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
BA pghlee at The Brick Store gave me a sneak taste of this a couple of weeks ago, now I get a chance to have a proper crack at it.
Pour is almost black with about 3/4 of an inch of frothy, light head. Mocha colored. On the pour at least the beer seems quite carbonated and fizzy. Things settle down to give some nice lace and a classic, spotty, creamy surface on the beer.
Nose gives the lightly, tart fruit that one would expect from the cherries and a very light touch of funk.
The tastes give a light, blue cheese funk up front and some more light acidity. A bit like balsamic vinegar but not at all that harsh. The back-end and finish is where the cherries kick in. REAL, non-sweetened cherries with a gentle, tart note. More blue cheese in the aftertaste.
Very tasty but you have to be in the mood for a slightly funky Belgian Dark. This is not a classic, dark fruity, rich, sweet Belgian since the cherries add a touch of funk and the blue cheese note. Pretty interesting and not an everyday Belgian for me (since I prefer a more classic Belgian Dark), but catch me in the right mood and I'll enjoy it."

Pour is a very nice, hazed orange with great carbonation and some pretty decent head. Light and wispy &#8206;on top. &#8206;
Nose is very interesting since it sums up the whole beer rather well. The smell gets into this strange &#8206;no-man's-land between ""greater than standard/subtle"", but ""not quite imperial/double"". The tastes &#8206;are the same. It threatens alcohol but it never quite delivers; it says it will deliver a flavor punch, but &#8206;doesn't. A touch of medicinal pepper.&#8206;
It's REALLY odd to me because I am the type of person that craves low ABV, subtle beer but still &#8206;appreciates and enjoys many of the larger brews. This really OUGHT to be a massive Imperial Pilsner &#8206;&#8206;(or the like), but it slightly misses by being too subtle. The problem is that it's too BIG to be subtle. It &#8206;misses on both counts!&#8206;
It just falls between two stools. The alcohol never kicks in properly but it's too big to be sessionable.&#8206;
Quite frustrating, but still tastes OK.&#8206;"
Old Dominion Brewing Co.,Baltic Porter,,,American Porter,7.00%,bottle,3.25,4,3.5,3,3,3.5,12/12/2009,"12 oz single at Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Chestnut brown pour, mocha head and looks solid and sticky.
Nose is a roasted malt combo with some light vanilla and a touch of sour lactose.
Tases are solid, but perhaps the weakest part of the beer. Lacks punch for me, even though it sits squarely in the style. I'm a little confused with the relatively light feel and shallow depth.
I dunno, quite nice but ultimately feels somewhat lacking in some way. Can't really put my finger on it but it leaves me wanting more."
Terminal Brew House,Thrilla Vanilla,,,American Porter,?,growler,3.95,4,4,4,3.5,4,12/12/2009,"Thanks go out to Scott for bringing this one back from TN. Cheers Bud.
The beer looks great. Large, off-white head with some serious red highlights and good density of color. Nose gives the vanilla as expected but quite reserved.
Plenty of vanilla in the taste too and perhaps some smoke too. The degree of chocolate malt character is quite pronounced as well. That was surprising.
Mellow, drinkable and a tasty brew. My first from this brewhouse and I am impressed; definitely want to explore this place some more. 
Drinks easily a very nice rendition of the style.
Commericial description;
The addition of vanilla beans in the fermentation of our Porter makes this dark but smooth treat that much more dynamic in your mouth. We believe that this aromatic vanilla porter will produce a feeling in you that only the juxtaposition of smooth and mild but commanding and flavorful can create. This rope-a-dope style of taste bud jabbing is what defines this tantalizing cool weather cocktail. This beer may make you actually lighter on your feet and proclaim yourself the greatest of all time."

Pour is a close to colorless/pale lemon until the last pour which yielded some sediment that thickened the appearance and the body considerably.
A lot of things in-line with the style here from the spritzy and lively carbonation, through to the apple-like tartness and the easy of drinking. Delighted to able able to drink a serious, American craft beer in a style that demands an ABV below 5%. That in itself was a great change of pace.
Some green apple skins and an obiovus light acidity make the beer complete. Not quite as tart as I was expecting, and for that alone this beer was extremely drinkable. It is a small departure in terms of the style, and in some respects I think it is best left to the original brewers in the original place to get the full-effect of a beer like this. There is definitely something lost by not being at the source. Having said that, this still drank nicely and I think, whilst although slightly off-base in terms of FULL authenticity (how could it possibly be otherwise?), it did a pretty decent job.
ABV a BONUS! With so little, high quality LOW ABV craft beer produced in America, I have to take what I can get."

About 14 months old by now.
Nose seems stronger than ever (in a good way). The carbonation is still quite prickly, and I think this is probably the weakest part of the beer, but paradoxically it lends a pretty lively element t"
Weyerbacher Brewing Co.,Fourteen Ale,,,Wheatwine,11.80%,bottle,4.08,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,12/6/2009,"12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour is a deeper orange color than I was expecting. Considering the ABV and the style, the head and lace are good and in that respect this looks better than I was expecting.
The nose is VERY, VERY alcoholic and banana liquer-like. Bubble-gum too.
The whole feel is like a cross between an Imperial Pilsner, a large Weizenbock and a fairly hot wheat beer of some description. Slick in the mouth but NOT as oily as the ABV would suggest. More huge bananas and alcoholic wheat based bubble-gum.
The drinkability is very good, but the alcohol restricts consumption in the final analysis.
An interesting beer that was more drinkable than I was expecting. It's large but JUST pulls it off - a bit like Thirteen!"
The Bruery,2 Turtle Doves,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,12.00%,bottle,4.03,4.5,4,4,4,4,12/3/2009,"$11.99 (I think) from Arbor Place, Douglasville, GA, USA. 750 mL bottle, capped, dimpled bottom.
Pour is a very, very dark chestnut brown approaching black. Initially the head is very high but this fades to a thin, mocha, spotty impressive film. Not much lace but that's OK considering the ABV. This is a good looking beer. To be honest the carbonation seemed a touch high for the style and there was a light prickle in the mouthfeel that although not troublesome, again seemed a touch out of line with the traditional aspects of the style.
Some fruity bread in the nose.
There's a surprising amount of licorice and burned character here. Some charcoal and a fair dose of alcohol as well, but also some fruity acidity. It's a bit of a crazy mix. There is indeed some Belgian dark character, but there is also some Belgian based stout notes as well. I guess the Belgian stout flavor is the cocoa nibs coming through. I don't get much nutty flavor from the pecans though. Some sweet and sour in the finish as well. Even a touch of lactose milk stout. Interesting mix!
Interesting, and a really nice beer that you should try if you get the chance, BUT it does push ""Belgian Dark"" a little too far for me. It's there (or thereabouts), but it's at the extremes of the style for me and in that respect, although I really liked it there are quite a few in the style that I would choose before it."
Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),Samuel Adams Coastal Wheat,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,5.30%,bottle,3.68,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,11/29/2009,"12 oz single from Total Wine, Perimeter, Atlanta, GA, USA. Notched Mar 2010 on the label.
I *think* that this is currently being included in the Sam Adams Winter 12 pack - GOD knows why - it doesn't belong there and it's a bloody liberty by BBC to put his beer in that mixer - out of order, STOP it! Marketing RULES in the USA!
Pour gives a decent, hazed, honey colored body with a high white head and some really good lace in the Southampton Weizen glass. Good looker.
Nose is largely neutral and really only gives a touch of sweetness and certainly minimal citrus from any kind of lemon.
Wheat based tastes that surprisingly lack any depth of lemon. Sure, there is a crispness about the beer, and sure it seems refreshing (if somewhat unseasonal), but the citrus notes remain largely a mystery to me. There is some sweet, very light caramel of perhaps a little butterscotch, but the lemon is lost on me.
Rounded nicely in the mouth and quite satisfying,
Strange - I enjoyed this, would probably drink it again, but LEMON and in WINTER???? No way on either count! Odd."
Clipper City Brewing Co. / Heavy Seas Beer,Heavy Seas - Yule Tide,,,Tripel,10.00%,bottle,3,3,3,3,3,3,11/29/2009,"22 oz bottle from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
So far I've been pretty unimpressed with the recent Heavy Seas/Clipper City bomber offerings, with the DIPA being especially poor and the Pumpkin and Marzen not really setting the house on fire either, so I approach this with a bit of trepidation. I feel a little more optimistic about Yule Tide, since I love a good Tripel and this is the kind of beer that should sit well at the elevated 10% ABV level - we'll see.
Pour is a golden orange which is a touch darker than I usually like for the style. Even though I'm not expecting huge things with this ABV, the head and lacing are a touch disappointing to me.
Nose is pure candied sugar with a touch of alcohol.
The alcohol is pretty well hidden with plenty of bubble-gum and other estery fruits. It's a little ill-defined for me with lots of obvious, syrupy fruit and alcohol but it seems a bit muddled. Lacks definition and any kind of serious edge for a classic style.
Once again this misses for me. With the seemingly ever increasing frequency of these 22 oz releases, the feeling I get is that Clipper City is rushing these beers out to somehow capitalize on the relative popularity of craft beer. I just feel as though they are off target which is surprising and disappointing given how much I like Below Decks and Hang Ten. I'm a bit disillusioned to be honest."

Pour gives a solid looking, chocolate based pour with a well formed, compact off-white head. A LOT of sediment is transfered on the first pour. Settles nicely.
Nose and tastes reveal what I would call a brown ale with spice. As usual the spices are difficult to pinpoint exactly, but certainly some all-spice and a touch of citrus peel/orange. Despite the obvious spice, the beer actually holds its own as a brown ale quite strongly. Malt backbone holds up nicely and the spices come in gentle waves rather than a massive assault - in that respet it is a relatively subtle beer.
Interesting, but obviously *very* seasonal and in that respect not a beer that will ever be much more than simply a one-off. Nevertheless tasty, enjoyable and nice addition to the Christmas table."
Brouwerij Van Steenberge N.V.,Witches' Brew,,,Tripel,9.30%,bottle,3.9,5,3,4,3.5,4.5,11/26/2009,"750 mL corked & caged from Arbor Place Beverage, Douglasville, GA, USA $11.99.
I've passed on this a few times at the store, finally took the plunge when the stock seemed to go down to the last bottle. Van Steenberge is solid, so thought I should go ahead.
Pour is very impressive. Firstly the beer pops with a healthy blast and the gunsmoke is good. The color is a deep orange with just the right amount of cloudiness. Even more impressive is the head. Bone white and fantastically sticky and persistent, especially on the surafce of the beer. Greaty spotty surface foam.
Nose is the weakest part for me, which gives some of that musty, old beer nose. Luckily this is not carried over to the taste in any significant way. Quite creamy in the mouth (perhaps not as profound as some in the style), but holds its own. Light alcohol, light sugar and spice too. Finishes strong by bringing all of those elements together. Mild prickle in the back end.
Classic Tripel? Perhaps not, a bit softer than many in the style but still drinks well.
Tasty and a nice beer to replace wine and could act as an aperitif."
Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,Life & Limb,,,American Strong Ale,10.20%,bottle,3.9,4,4,4,4,3.5,11/26/2009,"$9.99 for the 24 oz bottle a la SN Harvest brews.
Pour is a dark, chestnut body with some frothy lace sitting on the surface. Little lace, but as expected for the ABV.
Surprisingly smooth drinking given the alcoholic content. The beer is very sweet (obviously as a function of the syrup), but also maintains a decent balance of flavors without losing the plot. Alcohol is very well hidden until the back end when it kicks in slightly. Hop profile is lowish
Definitely a light, woody note and some well worn leather in there too. The beer is actually more rounded than I expected and comes together in quite a gentle way considering the complicated array of ingredients. A little medicinal and organic, and a pronounced leafy or earthy tone in there as well. Hay?
I was surprised at how accessible this was as I was expecting an assault on the senses that would be too aggressive. Having said that I don't know that the price, ABV or type of beer that this is will lend itself to anything other than the very occasional tipple.
Better than expected, but still just too much all in one glass for me."
Smuttynose Brewing Company,Smuttynose Big A IPA (Big Beer Series),,,American Double / Imperial IPA,9.60%,bottle,4.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,11/26/2009,"I've been waiting to try this for many years, and after the initial influx of Smuttynose to Georgia this finally came into the seasonal rotation a few days ago. $4.99 for the bomber from Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA.
This beer essentially ""does what it says on the can"".
The pour is a classic, American DIPA orange body with good clarity and plenty of thick, high, white, fluffy head. Lacing is extremely good considering the ABV.
Nose and tastes give that oily, sinus clearing, hop-resin note that are reminiscent of something from the other coast. Sweetness is there, but under control and hops run riot as one would expect them too. A touch of oil in the character and plenty of tangy perfume notes.
A really nice beer if you are looking for your hop fix, but it's not a craving that I get very often so I will probably not drink this much in the future. If you are a hop-head that needs this kind of thing on a regular basis then be prepared to put this into your regular rotation.
Not a great deal to report here other than a big, American, resionous DIPA."
Coors Brewing Company,Blue Moon Grand Cru,,,Witbier,8.20%,bottle,2.38,3.5,3.5,2,2,2,11/25/2009,"$5.99 from Green's on Buford Highway, Atlanta, GA, USA. It appears as though people are paying a LOT more for this beer around the country. It had LITERALLY been just entered into the Green's system, so perhaps it will be adjusted upward in time. I certainly wouldn't want to pay more than I did, though.
Poured into the Southampton Weizen glass, the beer gives a nice head initially but to be honest it fades rather quickly and delivers very little lace. Requisite clouded butterscotch color in the body. 
The nose yields mainly what one would expect considering the beer that this is supposed to be. Slight solvent alcohol with those tell-tale, non-descript spices.
The beer ""dies"" in the glass really quickly with the initial, short lived, vibrant feel lost to a syrupy, hot alcohol unbalanced feel much too soon. It gets edgy, a touch rough (as in, ""malt liquor/homeless rough"") and generally gets a little classless at an alarming rate. Wits really don't need to be amped up, and at the best of times American craft brewers tend to butcher subtle styles with excess alcohol and big notes, so when left to one of the big boys things go downhill much faster.
Solvent alcohol increases quickly and the spices are lost in the mix. The banana and clove notes become barely relevant as the beer starts to resemble a cross between Steel Reserve and rubbing alcohol.
I dunno, things started well, and I don't dislike Blue Moon, but getting American brewers involved with subtle styles can be a big mistake and coupling the BMC angle the whole thing drops off rapidly. Shame.
Bandwagon jumping by Coors and it shows."
Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV,Maredsous 6 - Blonde,,,Belgian Pale Ale,6.00%,bottle,4.15,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,11/21/2009,"11.2 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA in the same stubby bottle but with the updated label (added in the last couple of years).
The kind of beer that has got lost in the American UBER-beer craze, but EXACTLY the kind of beer I would drink on a regular basis in Belgium on my umpteen trips there. Basically a ""single"" that drinks simply and with style.
Mild gusher. Honey colored poured with a spotty head and a medium amount of head and retention.
Nose and tastes give some simple yeast, a light note of citrus fruit and then some sweeter honey and pineapple notes. Rounded and smooth and the finish even offers the very slightest hint of acidity/funk.
Very slight dying note in the aftertaste and a touch of metal finish the beer.
Insanely drinkable, beautiful in its own simplicity this is a beer that will get overlooked far too often in the USA but actually represents the best things about Belgian brewing; simple, great quality, everyday beers that define an everyday beer culture that is missing from America."
Magic Hat Brewing Company,Howl,,,Schwarzbier,4.60%,on-tap,3.55,3.5,3,3.5,4,4,11/21/2009,"A surprise package at the Douglasville Taco Mac, Douglasville, GA, USA.
Pour appears to be a brown affair with some reddish highlights and a white cap. Head fades quickly and lace is minimal.
This was described to me as a Winter Ale, is in the BA db as I type as a Schwarzbier, and frankly looks and drank like neither!
In essence there are some fairly significant chocolate malts which fade to give a malt dominated, mild beer with a tiny, tiny hop kick in the finish. Basically it sits somewhere between an American and an English Brown Ale without any frills. Simple, drinkable and straightforward I enjoyed the one pint I had but felt that was just about all I needed to get the feel of this.
Smooth in the mouth and drinkable, it was instantly forgettable and lacked much presence."
Victory Brewing Company,Helios  (V Saison),,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,7.50%,bottle,3.53,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,11/21/2009,"22 oz bottle from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA. This the same beer as the now retired V-Saison and is retailing around the Atlanta area for a very reasonable $2.99 in some places.
Body is a golden clear one with some nice persistent carbonation. Head is high and huge.
Quite a large dose of lemony funk in the nose with a touch of soap too.
Tastes are milder than the nose might suggest. Sweeter notes combine with the soapy citrus flavors to even things out a bit. Finish accentuates the soap character. Aftertaste also has a very bitter parts to it as well. A little more pine sol character too.
Interesting and perhaps more drinkable than the soapy notes would suggest. A bit of a weird combo of sweetness, soap, light funk and medicinal parts. Strange but worth a try."
Gordon Biersch Brewery Restaurant,Gordon Biersch Märzen,,,Märzen / Oktoberfest,5.70%,bottle,3.15,3,3,3,3.5,3.5,11/20/2009,"12 oz single, Taco Mac, Marietta (Dallas Highwway), Marietta, GA, USA.
Pleased to see this being distributed in bottles now after enjoy the same beer in various GB locations for many years.
What I've also said about the GB Marzen when drunk on the premises, is that is has a great, sweet, HIGH yeast feel to it which adds hugely to it's drinkability. This bottled version seems to lack a number of those attrivbutes, and for me REALLY strongly highlights the difference between bottled beer and a (perhaps) fresher kegged version.
The usual bright, clear, sharp look seems to be missing from this version, although the color is similar. The lively yeast also seems a little missing, and the carbonation is less satisfying. Drinks OK, but I can't help wishing that I was drinking a kegged version at the brewpub. It just doesn't quite work as well for me."
"Lakefront Brewery, Inc.",Oktoberfest Lager Beer,,,Märzen / Oktoberfest,5.70%,bottle,2.95,3,3,3,2.5,3,11/20/2009,"12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour gives a medium, dull-copper body but the level of carbonation and general ""liveliness"" is somewhat below average.
Nose and tastes reveal a certain malt sweetness as expected, but at the same time fail to deliver the typical, malt-punch that I need from my O'fest. The beer drinks decidedly flat as well which is a bit of problem for me. Tasted a bit like one might expect a ""rough round the edges"" homebrew in the style would come out.
Looking for a bright, vibrant angle in this style and to be honest this failed to deliver. Authentic tastes, and perhaps the potential to be better than this experience, but to be honest I was ultimately disappointed. The beer seemed drab, and lacking an edge."
Smuttynose Brewing Company,Smuttynose Imperial Stout (Big Beer Series),,,Russian Imperial Stout,9.80%,bottle,3.1,4,3.5,3,3.5,2.5,11/20/2009,"22 oz bottle from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA. 2009 bottling from earlier this year.
Been holding on to this for a few months, tonight was the night to crack it open. Into the Terrapin snifter in a number of pours.
Simple stuff on the pour; black as night, mocha head, medium in size. Simple and as expected.
Nose at first gives a bready like aroma but this soon gives way to a quite aggressive, medicinal hop base against a background of a touch of solvent alcohol.
This beer drinks very harshly despite the few months of age on it. Light alcohol solvent, mild burn on the way down and a very strong, medicinal, hop-resin type taste that sits poorly with me. Ultimately this is an extrememely bitter beer which surprised me a bit. Smuttynose often brews better, more rounded beer. This was just astringent and lacked any degree of subtlety.
A touch hot (which I can handle), but to be honest the greenish, raw hop profile really turned me off. American Double Stout in my book, MUCH more so than a sweeter, more rounded RIS. For that reason, although the beer is certainly not *bad* as such, it was disappointing. Quite a lot of citrus grapefruit bitterness which I thought may have subsided a bit since bottling. Quite harsh.
If you are looking for a RIS in the classic, sweeter, English origin mold, then this is NOT it."
"Bell's Brewery, Inc.",Bell's Winter White Ale,,,Witbier,5.00%,bottle,3.98,3.5,4,4,4,4,11/17/2009,"12 oz single from Hop Cty, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour is a surprisingly ORANGE color which the requisite hazed body. Color definitely forms a distinct orange (rather than yellow color that is often the case in Wits). Head is surprisingly disappointing and poorly retained for the style. As a result lace is minimal. Normally one can expect a really decent, rocky, white cap on Wit's but this one does not deliver very well in that department.
Fruity and lightly acidic nose and tastes rather than spice based. The tangerine notes come through quite strong and the fruit builds as the beer warms slightly. The relative lack of spice is surprisingly, and is largely replaced by serious fruits. I like it, but it seems a touch atypical for the style.
Very drinkable and light in the mouth.
I enjoyed this very much, found it refreshing and sharp/tart, but it seemed low on spice which may disappoint so when they consider the style. All in all it didn't matter to me, so I still rate this beer as a decent Wit, IF a little at the edges of the style."
Hair of the Dog Brewing Company / Brewery and Tasting Room,Fred From The Wood,,,American Barleywine,10.00%,bottle,4.18,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,11/17/2009,"12 oz bottle from a recent trade. 2008 vintage.
Pour is a surprisingly light, golden orange body with creamy spotty head. Better head than I had expected considering the ABV and the style. Very lively, bright and impressive appearance for a beer of the style and with some age on it.
Nose has a large sweet element amongst the very rounded, soft bourbon element.
Tastes are an interesting amalgam of English and American Barleywine style. English seems to dominate for me at first with plenty of sweetness upfront. Strong brown sugar character and lots of sweet, mild bourbon tastes. After that, and in the back end, there is a more pronounced American element with some dry tobacco, greater alcohol, some mild burn and then some distinct hop bitterness. Oak is pretty subtle, or at least as subtle as any such beer is ever likely to get. Smooth. Honey builds and comes with a touch of champagne dryness.
Despite this, overall the beer really does seem mild, sweet and somewhat atypical for an American version of a barrel-aged beer of ANY description.
Overall I was surprised at the gentle touch this beer had. Normally I'm not a fan of either American Barleywines or oak-aged beer, but this pulls it off nicely with a with a subtlety that is unusual.
I would definitely pair this with some cheese and crackers and almost any cheese would work for me,"
Beer Here,Dark Hops,,,American Black Ale,8.50%,bottle,4,5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,11/15/2009,"New entrant to the Atlanta market that I picked up at Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Didn't really fancy this much, but Kraig persuaded me and I am delighted that he did.
Pour produces a MASSIVE, and I mean MASSIVE, dark, dark mocha colored head and a jet black body. Amazingly looking pour!
Nose is maasive (again) hugely malty and sweet, followed by a tiny, medicinal, herbal hop finish.
Much the same is experienced in the tastes. This largely feels like an English, relatively sweet stout until the very back end of the taste where the herbal hop notes come crashing in. Alcohol is well hidden. The herbal and medicinal notes build over the course of the beer and get a touch annoying at the end, but to be honest this is the American character coming through.
Pretty interesting beer which is a INITIALLY a little more subtle than the name and style suggests, but ultimately IS quite hoppy and lives up to the moniker. It just takes time for the beer to get to that point.
Interesting."
Boak Beverage,Boaks Monster Mash Imperial Stout,,,Russian Imperial Stout,10.00%,bottle,4.05,4,4,4,4.5,4,11/15/2009,"12 oz single as an extra as part of a recent trade.
Pour is the requisite black ink body with some nice lace in a mocha, coffee color that is provoked by an aggressive pour. Opaque, even at the extremeties.
Nose gives away plenty of really strong malts and a touch of alcohol.
Alcohol is fairly well hidden and I might have said that it was more in the 7-8% range rather than 10%. Simple roasted flavors, touches of alcohol and a fairly large dose of licorice make up the body of the beer. Smooth in the mouth and rather drinakble.
A creamy beer that I enjoyed very much, and even more as the bottle warmed. Oddly, the next day I noticed that I had left about 3 oz in the bottom of the bottle and I drank it with about 24 hours exposure to the elements on it. It showed no signs of noticeable oxidation (obviously some MUST have taken place), and it still had a decent amount of carbonation! Sign of a well made beer? Perhaps, but it was an interesting addition to my experience with this one!
Tasty stuff."
Hepworth & Co. (Brewers) Ltd.,Iron Horse,,,English Bitter,4.80%,bottle,3.73,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,11/15/2009,"500 mL bottle, Hop City, Atlanta, GA $3.99. Good value I thought.
Light colored, amber body with plenty of airy bubbles and head. Good retention and some nice, sticky white lace that leaves an attractive pattern.
Nose is a light, floral note. Hops upfront, but in a subtle, non-assertive English manner.
Tastes deliver a dryish experience with more hops than I was expecting. To be honest this drinks more like an English Pale Ale or perhaps even an English IPA rather than a Bitter. it lacks much sweetness or depth, so not a classic example of the English Bitter style for me.
Carbonation is a touch prickly in the mouth.
Drinkable and thirst quenching, I enjoyed the brew but I'd have to take it out of the style listed on BA to be completely satisfied."
Highland Brewing,Highland Cattail Peak Wheat,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,4.70%,bottle,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,11/15/2009,"12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Last time I drank this it was directly from the tank, at the brewery, on a trip to Asheville, NC back in April of this year. Obviously nothing could be fresher than THAT, but I'm curious to see how this is now.
Color is very much like the label with yellow (rather than gold) being the order of the day. Definitely different to a typical macro lager that would give that golden color. Some chill haze is apparent. Head is small and not particularly well-retained, but still manages to leave some thin, watery lace.
Whaet notes in the nose; quite strong.
Tastes are fairly neutral but gives some simple acidity, a touch of bitterness from the rye but ultimately adds up to a very clean, refreshing, simple drink. Massively quaffable and still hits the spot here in Georgia since the temperatures have been in the 70's on these last few November days!
tasty, simple brew with sessionable potential in the warmer weather, which in the South means March to Novemeber!"
Avery Brewing Company,DuganA IPA,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,8.50%,on-tap,3.9,4,4,4,4,3.5,11/14/2009,"Passed on this at Hop City in the bomber, and went with a pint at Taco Mac on the East-West Connector, Austell, GA, USA instead.
Pour is a mid-brown with a nice rocky, creamy head that has pretty good lace, retention and ""stickability"". Looks good.
Nose and tastes reveal some pretty strong west-coast style, grapefruit astringency with an additional fair amount of residual sugar and bitterness. Resinous feel about the beer as one would expect. Alcohol is there too.
As usual for the style, the hop profile fatigues the palate extremely quickly and even at the end of the pint I've had enough, no chance of drinking any more of these.
What can I say that hasn't already been said about hundreds of similar, good quality DIPA's? - Another solid version of the style by a solid brewer, but ultimately this is just a little run-of-the-mill and not a beer that stands out in the myriad of similar brews out there. Well done, but how about something else in a style less well covered by brewer's like Avery?
Very little to report here. Quite what the point of the umpteenth American DIPA really is is slightly beyond me, I would thing that another style would be a way to attract drinkers toward a new beer...anyway....there it is."

16 oz pint.
Slightly murky, brown body with good lace. Some chill haze in the glass, not much clarity.
Aroma has very hop-based and I could easily feel this ought to be classified as a typical American DIPA.
Typically Rogue, the beer seems slightly over-hopped to me, and this beer is essentially a DIPA. Resinous hops, strong, astringent nose and a slight burn. Hops tire the palate quickly in a combination of residual sweetness and fatiguing, west coast hops.
Not really my cup of tea, one and done."
Spoetzl Brewery,Shiner Holiday Cheer,,,Dunkelweizen,5.40%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,11/14/2009,"12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Interesting to say the least.
I didn't bother to read the label in detail before I bought this so I just assumed it would be another, spiced Christmas Ale. That's OK, since I really enjoy that type of beer, so imagine my surprise when I started to drink the beer and then read the reviews on BA.
Appearance is a lovely, tawny, clear brew with a decent head that has some lace and retention. The nose and tastes reveal what I thought were initially a cherry-like essence but when I started to read the reviews the peach dd start to make more sense.
The interesting thing about the beer is that it build to a malty, lightly bitter finish and it has some fairly serious biscuit like malts in the finish. The ending is almost, almost, English ESB-like. Tasty.
Very pleasing to drink despite the odd combination and somewhat strange flavors; a classic example of a beer where the sum of parts seems greater than the individual pieces taken alone. As for being a Dunkelweizen - I don't think so!"
Terrapin Beer Company,Terrapin Hopsecutioner,,,American IPA,7.30%,bottle,3.85,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,11/14/2009,"In the Terrapin mixed 12 pack, will be out in sixers shortly I understand.
12 oz bottle. Pour gives a very nice, mid-golden body with good clarity. Head is white, well formed and provides some lace.
Nose is that of a fresh, wet hopped beer which may be as much a function of its freshness as anything else. 
Tastes are very simple. Initially very clean and hoppy - good, but after that it gets pretty sweet and the hops build a little. In addition there is also a slight floral note and even a bit of solvent-like alcohol.
Pretty much your standard American IPA with a dash of sweet fruit along with the big hop profile. It's a simple, well-crafted beer but ultimately, Y-A-W-N! Why not a Wit, an ESB, a smoked porter, a maibock etc. My point being, do we REALLY need another hiighly hopped, American IPA? I'm confused. Seems like missing the boat a bit."

Quite an aggressive pour leads to a decent amount of solid, mocha head but as expected (considering the ABV) it fades quite quickly. Some spotty film on the surface of the beer after it settles down.
Mid brown body with a viscous murkiness about it. The mouthfeel is very smooth. To be fair, it is a smoothness that is born out of a little, cloying sweetness, but at the same time it does go down easily. Sugary 
It's certainly very sweet with the alcohol fairly well hidden, and in that respect this is nothing like an American BW and much more like an English version of the style. The alcohol does grow a touch and it begins to burn a touch and finish with some dry character. More sugar in the aftertaste and a little more heat.
Don't come here looking for a hop based, American BW, you'll be disappointed, rather take it as a sweet version of the style in the English mode and it will make more sense."

Extraordinary that I have never reviewed this.
Pour gives a lovely creamy head on top of dark brown body. Light brown, mahoghany highlights. Head is well retianed and produces some great lace. Good looking, perhaps the srtongest attribute of the beer.
Roasted malts are really quite bitter and the mouthfeel has a medium body. Bitter and dry finish. Creamy charcoal. Stylistically very good.
The bitterness here seesm to build quite significantly and surprisingly, by the end of the beer, it gets a bit bothersome. Lingers in the aftertaste along with a classic, dry note. A touch of dry chocolate in there as well.
Pretty much in style, but the bitterness seemed a bit high too me. this subtracted from the drinkability somewhat."
Dark Horse Brewing Company,Dark Horse Fore Smoked Stout,,,American Stout,?,bottle,4.1,5,4,4,4.5,4,11/8/2009,"12 oz bottle from a recent trade.

Firstly the pour is really, really, really good looking. Jet black with with no light penetrating and ome incredibly colored head - literally like a deep, rich espresso. The appearance is so striking that I am almost expecting a coffee-based RIS with twice the alcohol that this thing has. Looks viscous.
The next odd thing is that there really is hardly any smoke here at all. Not in the nose or the tastes. It ""sort of"" appears a touch, but this could be because of the roasted malts as much as anything else. Not smoky by virtally any standard.
Very rich in the mouth wil plenty odf silky smoothness. I anm curious as to the ABV since this drink in a manner that suggests it's really quite high, but the tastes don't burn or create much evidence to suggest it is really big.
Light licorice followed by the requisite roasted malts and slightly burned character, but again I don't really feel a big smoke element at any point in the process.
A VERY rich looking and drinking beer without much smoke and a curiously elusive alcohol content."
Hepworth & Co. (Brewers) Ltd.,Old Ale,,,Old Ale,4.80%,bottle,4.03,4.5,4,4,4,4,11/8/2009,"New entrant to the USA picked up for $3.99 at Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
500 mL bottle.
Pour has a nice, rich brown, tawny body and some excellent head, retention and lace.
As expected nose and tastes reflect lots of sweet malts athough they come with ome organic, earth tones that drop it away from the pure sweetness of some heavier Old Ales. Plenty of sweet, brown ale character with easy drinking, light biscuit malts forming he majority of the tastes. The light drinking nature of this beer is what strikes me more than almost anything else.
Very light in the mouth which adds to the drinkability."
New Holland Brewing Company,New Holland The Poet,,,Oatmeal Stout,5.20%,bottle,3.8,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,4,11/8/2009,"12 oz bottle, thanks to Grant for the chance to try this one.
Jet black body but the head is rather poor and somewhat white in color. Retention is not great either and of course, neither is the lace. Some spotty film on the surface of the beer. I thought that the head might be better than this ultimately produces.
No mistaking this an an oatmeal version of the stout genre. Very smooth in the mouth with some residual sweetness created by the grain.
Leaves a nice coating on the teeth and tongue again that comes with a residual suagr note.
The light toasted/roasted malts do not provide much bitterness and the beer rounds out to be pretty smooth on the whole.
Nice, simple and drinkable. Style hit nicely and a decent version. Tasty."
Yards Brewing Co.,Love Stout,,,English Stout,5.00%,bottle,3.65,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,11/8/2009,"12 oz single from a recent trade.
Pour is the requisite black with very little light penetrating any part of the pour. Head is not huge, and the lace minimal. Thin ring of mocha lace acting as a collar on the surface of the beer.
Nose yields some soft, sweet malts and not too much in the way of bitterness.
Tastes are definitely on the ""English"" side of things meaning we have a sweeter, less aggressive stout with some smooth, subtle character and even some residual sugar in the finish. Hops are reserved. Although this is obviously not a sweet stout as such, it certainly has a decent amount of sugary elements and back seat taken by the hops highlight this whole feel.
Drinks smoothly, if a touch thin. A very gentle, prickly carbonation is present too.
Simple, easy and drinkable."
Hepworth & Co. (Brewers) Ltd.,Pullman,,,English Bitter,4.20%,bottle,4.28,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,5,11/7/2009,"Delighted and surprised to get hold of this from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA. Obviously a new entrant to the American market, let alone the Atlanta one.
500 mL bottle that I bought along with the Old Ale and the Iron Horse Pale. Obviously a railway theme, both from the names and the shape of the Hepworth logo on the label. Good stuff.
Pour is quite a surprisingly light gold in color and the carbonation seems a touch on the high side, even a little bubbly. Some nice sticky lace.
Nose is a strong point with lots of rich, biscuit based malts. Some stinky hops!
Tastes are classic, if a little dry. Finish even gives a touch of puckering bitterness in a classic, English hop-based manner but drier than many. It's all subtle, simple and passive aggressive which will be way beyond the comprehension of many American palates. Lots of pale malts are upfront that hold their own.
This beers falls slap bang into the usual categories that one finds with bottled English Bitters that are imported to the USA, namely;
 + Would be infinitely better on cask, close to the source
 + Simple, subtle hop profile will be under-appreciated in the USA
 + Low ABV, malt base will be under-appreciated in the USA
Light , easy drinking for the warmer weather I would say. Outside of that not much to report, I really like it*, many Americans won't.
*I DO understand that the lack of these beers in the USA tend to color my opinions a little when I get them, but I DO consider my potential bias when I review them."
Privatbrauerei Franz Inselkammer KG / Brauerei Aying,Ayinger Weizenbock,,,Weizenbock,7.10%,bottle,4.55,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,5,11/7/2009,"Unexpected (but welcome), recent arrival at Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA. 500 mL bottle.
Poured into the Tucher Weizen glass the beer gives a lovely golden hazed body and a huge, imperious and airy head. Just the ticket. Some lace.
Nose and tastes are right on the money for the style. Bubblegum, banana, alcohol laden fruits, with a mild burn in the finish. A good dose and alcoholic bitterness jumps in at the back end.
A few phenolic, medicinal notes add to the experience and there is also a fairly large amount of toffee that I was not expecting. The toffee element is surprising but makes this beer for me. Delicious.
A classic example of the style, would be difficult to find a better example."
Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,Sierra Nevada Belgian Trippel,,,Tripel,7.90%,on-tap,3.53,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,11/7/2009,"Delighted and surprised to find this on tap at Taco Mac in Douglasville, GA, USA. 16 oz pour.
Pours with a bright, bright golden body, a decent head and amazingly clarity. Normally I'm a huge fan of such clarity but to be honest I expect my Tripel's to lack some that and have a least a degree of chill-haze about them. Surprised at the clear nature of the beer.
Nose reveals some typical bubblegum notes.
The tastes are essentially ALL, massive, sweet, sugar! There isn't really the slightly spiced, Belgian yeast notes that one would normally associate with the style. All Tripel's need that high level of sweetness, but this seems extraordinarily so; this is coming from me who likes sweetness, and even considering that the style demands a good degree of it. As I drink it I'm thinking that this could give me a TERRIBLE headache and hangover! As the beer settles and warms there is a touch more of the other attributes that one might expect for the style, but ultimately they can't really compete with the cloying sweetness. I think it just goes slightly beyond where it needs to be.
Not bad, but a tad unbalanced for me. Not 100% sure about the body clarity or the level of sugar that we get here,; it seems at the VERY edges of what is acceptable. I might visit this again but I suspect that it would be in small doses."
Widmer Brothers Brewing Company,Cherry Oak Doppelbock (Brothers' Reserve Series),,,Doppelbock,9.00%,bottle,2.75,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,3,11/5/2009,"Cherry Oak Doppelbock? Not sure what to expect here, nor am I convinced that all of these elements are necessary but we'll see. Sep 09/09 on label, I guess that's the bottling date. First in the series.
Boxed bottle from Hop City, Atlants, GA, USA.
Pour is a murky brown, Dubbel-like body that lacks much head or lace, but does leave some spotty cream on the surface of the beer.
Plenty of very sweet malts in the nose but not much else.
The tastes are certainly malty but they lack much cherry character, at least any specific cherry character. There IS a fruit note in the finish but as for it being cherry, well, I dunno it does not seem distinctive to me at all. The oaking also seems largely lacking which I feel is a good thing but there is a modicum of dry character in the finish which could be as a result of the oak. More sweet malts continue to build which I like, and it is somewhat appropriate for the style, but the alcohol doesn't really make it to the level it should fro a Doppelbock and the distinct nature of the style also doesn't seem to make it through to the palate. It's a little weak in terms of its presence.
I'm not sure, but it seems like a poor Doppelbock, not very fruit based and hardly oaked; Not good signs for a ""Cherry, Oaked Doppelbock!"
New Belgium Brewing,La Folie,,,Flanders Red Ale,6.00%,bottle,4.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,11/1/2009,"Part of the new wave of Lips of Faith releases, this one in the silk-screened, Lips of Faith series as a 22 oz bottle rather than the corked and caged affairs of years past. I bet the purists are saying, ""it's just not the same"". Having not tasted this until now, I can't possibly comment on that so this review is just based on what's in the glass now. A good thing I feel.
For me, the temperature of this style is absolutely fundamental and crucial. Warming, as it does naturally in the glass, produces rounded notes that help the initially shocking start to the beer, even out.
Beer initially produces a lot of fizz, but the carbonation ultimately produces zero head and lace. Pretty much as expected for the style, the beer settles to have the carbonation qualities (at least in terms of appearance) of a flat, ""fizzy"" drink. The mouthfeel carbonation is a little more lively but not much. Color is a brownish, gravy-like hue. Not attractive at all, but pretty much as expected for the style.
Nose gives that typical, mild sinus clearing vinegar element that passes through the senses quite quickly. Obviously some cider notes as well. A touch of caramel.
Tastes are pretty much spot on for the style. Light vinegar in that builds and reaches a crescendo in the finish. Aftertaste lingers for a moment. Although it sounds a bit damning, there isn't much else to report. Actually that is meant as a compliment. As it warms it mellows (as predicted) and becomes increasingly drinkable.
To me, as good as many (but not all) Belgian originals, this really is an excellent example of the style. Requisite vinegar but well within parameters."
Shmaltz Brewing Company (He'Brew),He'Brew Jewbelation Bar Mitzvah (13),,,American Strong Ale,13.00%,bottle,4.05,4,4,4,4.5,4,11/1/2009,"In general I have been a huge fan of the malt-heavy beers that Shmaltz has put out in the Jewbelation, He'Brew series, so I'm delighted to have the chance to try the latest in the series. Always look forward to the annual offering, and given the GA alcohol limit we are getting close to the end of things we will see locally!
22 oz bottle that came from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour is dark brown body with some red highlights. The head is initially good with a mocha colored hue, and considering the ABV has decent retention and lace. Not the greatest, but the ABV always hits this aspect quite hard.
Nose has more than a touch of solvent alcohol and some burned malts.
The carbonation and mouthfeel both have a presence (highish and thinnish) that don't really match with the Imperial Stout designation. For that reason I might consider this in the American Strong Ale category instead. Alcohol is certainly there and burns a touch on the way down. Although this is STILL a hugely malted beer, it has more hop presence (in terms of bitterness) than we have been used to from Shmaltz.
Tastes reveal some really large licorice. Definitely the largest element of the the competing tastes. More alcohol and light charcoal in the back end. Coats the mouth and teeth quite substantially.
A VERY robust beer and definitely an interesting candidate for some age IMO. This feels REALLY young at the moment. Glad to see the brewery pushing some boundaries both in general terms AND in terms of getting out of their OWN comfort zone. Good stuff, but to be honest a little raw right now. Stick some in the cellar."
Southern Tier Brewing Company,Jahva (Imperial Coffee Stout),,,American Double / Imperial Stout,10.40%,bottle,3.13,4.5,3,3,3.5,3,11/1/2009,"22 oz silk-screened bottle. Winter 2008 bottling.
Pour is as expected with a deep, black body and some nice, frothy, mocha colored head. Not a great deal of lace but considering the ABV not an issue. Brown highlights.
Nose is surprisingly muted and lacks much of any discernable coffee notes.
Tastes are essentially very bitter, and not really in a good way. One might expect this to reflect some bitter coffee-grinds but that's not the bitterness I am really getting. It's a much more cigar, tobacco, leathery bitterness, not that pleasant. In addition the coffee is basically non-existant.
I would love to try this fresh just to see if the coffee is really part of the profile which has now faded, or if it was never there in the first place. Given the name, it was disappointing that it was not there. Either this beer is not a very good coffee based stout, or it simply doesn't age well."
Great Divide Brewing Company,Tripel,,,Tripel,9.30%,on-tap,3.13,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,10/31/2009,"11 oz pour at Taco Mac on the East West Connector, Austell, GA, USA.
Pour gives a classic, hazed yellow body but a rather disappointing lack of head (at least in terms of size). Lace is good.
Very strong, even ""artificially"" so; plenty of bubblegum aromas and a lot of sticky sweetness. BIG estery fruits and plenty of alcohol too. Now, of course, all of this is completely in order for the style, including (to an extent) the slick mouthfeel, but to be honest it seems a little floral and overpowering. The combination seems a bit unbalanced, slightly awkward and rather clumsy.
This is another of the newer, GD, 22 oz packaged beers that is really odd. I've been a great fan of GD in the past but this relatively new crop (the Dunkelweisse, Saison, Double Wit) has been very hit and miss with some crude tastes that have highlighted huge sweetness and alcohol. Some of those style demand it, but even my sweet loving palate they have seemed a little harsh."
Krasniy Vostok,Krasny Vostok Zhigulevskoe,,,Euro Pale Lager,4.50%,bottle,1.63,2,1.5,1.5,2.5,1.5,10/31/2009,"Always scary stuff when one reaches for an Eastern European lager. Not many high quality beers in this genre from that part of the world if the truth be known. This one came from a Russian Supermarket on the East side of Atlanta.
Pour is as expected, meaning that we get a clear gold colored liquid with a white head that disappears almost immediately. Virtually no lace. Some nasty looking sediment.
Nose and tastes give a curious lemony, sweetish, soapy sensation that lingers. Watery in terms of the mouthfeel and a plastic like sweetness comes into the picture.
I found it very difficult to drink more than a small amount and down the drain it went."
New Belgium Brewing,Lips Of Faith Biere De Mars,,,American Wild Ale,6.20%,bottle,2.85,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,10/31/2009,"22 oz screened bottle from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour gives a golden body with a frankly disappointing head. Not much retention or lace. Good clarity if nothing else.
Nose gives a lot of apple acidity that is quite noticeable. It also has a fairly large whiff of manure/wet horse-blanket. 
Interestingly enough, most of the funk goes away in the taste. There is a touch of cider in the back end, but the beer is not a funky one at all. Some yeast also comes into the picture along with some more typical large malt presence that one would expect from a beer in the style of a Biere de Mars/Garde. There is also some spice notes with a touch of white pepper but also some extra dry metallic notes.
I must admit I'm a bit confused as o what New Belgium is trying to do here. I think an American Wild Ale is a huge stretch, and perhaps better would be a Biere de Garde. At the same time it has some cider like notes. Strange beast and not really especially drinkable either. Finishes a little to dry and the whole thing doesn't sit all that well. It just doesn't seem to mesh very well."
Breckenridge Brewery,Lucky U IPA,,,American IPA,6.20%,bottle,4.33,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,10/30/2009,"&#8206;12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA. &#8206;
Attractive orange color on the pour with an excellent head and some superb lace. Not perfect clarity, &#8206;some chill haze. Retention is pretty good.&#8206;
Nose gives away a hoppy sweetness.&#8206;
The tastes are, in some ways, rather extraordinary. The beer is, to all intents and purposes, not much &#8206;other than pure, sweetened grapefruit juice. The grapefruit taste is amazingly strong and singular in its &#8206;&#8206;""obviousness"". This is NOT a hoppy character than is sometimes characterized as bring grapefruit, this &#8206;LITERALLY IS grapefruit! There isn't really much resinous, West Coast character either, it really does &#8206;seem like fruit juice rather than a hoppy beer. Pretty drinakable and refreshing.&#8206;
Actually I liked it a lot, but I bet some will find it too sweet. Pretty strange, but worth a shot. Try it for &#8206;breakfast! Odd.&#8206;"
Pisgah Brewing Co.,Vortex II,,,Russian Imperial Stout,11.70%,bottle,3.83,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,10/30/2009,"22 oz bottle from Brusin' Ales from the Jan 2009 release (I think). 
Pour is a standard jet black but it provides a very fizzy tan head. Short lived head and not much retention.
Nose and tastes give a LOT of sweetness and some bitterness that is characterized by some chicory. Definitely reminds me of the old Camp Coffee! 
The sweetness is noticeable as it rings up some lactose sweetness as well. Perhaps even feels a touch infected, as if the sweetness is just about to go sour. these competing notes are held together with some dryish chocolate as well. 
Alcohol is extremely well hidden. A bit of fruit, but the overwhelming feeling was that of a slightly rancid, milk sugar sweetness. Interesting.
Very drinkable and the alcohol seems almost absent when considering the numbers that are on the label.
Not really a classic RIS, more of an Imperial Milk Stout for me. You've really got to enjoy the sweeter side of things to enjoy this beer and luckily I do."
Anchor Brewing Company,Our Special Ale 2008 (Anchor Christmas Ale),,,Winter Warmer,5.50%,bottle,3.68,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,10/28/2009,"&#8206;2008 vintage that is approx. 1 year old (I purchased my usual, 2009 sixer a couple of days ago). &#8206;The usual Anchor code, 8OU dot-matrixed on this baby. 
&#8206; 
Nice, mocha colored head on top of the usual dark brown, garnet body. Head is maintained nicely &#8206;and the lace is nicely broken on the glass and firm on the surface. 
&#8206; 
The nose is surprisingly muted for the OSA. Normally one gets plenty of herbal spices but after a &#8206;year this seems muted somewhat. 
&#8206; 
Tastes are also less spicy than some have been in the past. A decent amount of licorice bitterness &#8206;that includes a touch of winter spice, but the whole package seems less aggressive than in years &#8206;gone by, even taking into account the year of age that's already on this. 
&#8206; 
Finishes with a touch more sweetness and perhaps a whiff of orange peel. Spice finally comes in &#8206;with the aftertaste. 
&#8206; 
Creamy in the mouth (as usual), the 2008 vintage is less spiced than many others and the age &#8206;seems to have driven that fact home even further. 
&#8206; 
Still a nice beer, but perhaps less ""interesting"" than other vintages."
Left Hand Brewing Company,Chocolate Starfish,,,English Brown Ale,6.00%,on-tap,4.35,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,10/28/2009,"A bit of background to this review. I ordered the beer at The Porter in Little Five, Atlanta, GA, &#8206;USA. A few minutes later I was joined by a friend of mine who knows very little about beer and &#8206;started engaging the barman about what to order and drink. As part of this conversation the &#8206;barman started offering advice about brown ales but he did NOT mention the Starfish in that &#8206;category. I was curious since it was a CLASSIC brown ale, and it was sitting in front of me, and &#8206;he had poured it for me about 2 minutes earlier. When I asked him what he thought the beer was &#8206;he said ""a strong chocolate ale""! Mmmm...I guess that's the last advice I'd be seeking from him. &#8206;Especially disappointing since he said that he had worked at The Porter since its opening. Oh &#8206;well, it's what I've become accustomed to. 
&#8206; 
Back to the beer. A classic, English style brown ale in most respects. Good depth on the color &#8206;with a nice head and good lace. The body was about right for the style and some classic, lightly &#8206;toasted malts, some digestive biscuit crumbs and sweetness. Very easy drinking and the beauty &#8206;of a beer like this is its simplicity. 
&#8206; 
ABV could go down a couple of notches to make it just about perfect, but nevertheless a very &#8206;enjoyable, drinkable and tasty beer. Complex enough to maintain interest and certainly moreish.

&#8206; 
I'm not an enormous fan of smoked beers in general, BUT it could be argued that if you are &#8206;going to smoke anything, the Imperial Porter would be a great candidate. 
&#8206; 
Pour is impresive. Black with a few reddish highlights and a SOLID head. The head looks like a &#8206;piece of bread, and is well sustained and produces some beautiful lace. 
&#8206; 
Sweet, light smoke makes up the nose. 
&#8206; 
The tastes obviously reflect the smoke, and we get the typical Imperial Porter, sweet roast notes, &#8206;but in addition there is some sharp, hop based bitterness as well. In the back end (not quite the &#8206;finish) there is also a fairly strong dose of chocolate - THAT, I was not expecting. The alcohol is &#8206;really quite strong and cumulative. Warming on the way down. 
&#8206; 
VERY easy drinking and a really tasty brew. I wasn't looking for quite so much bitterness (I am &#8206;creamy, sweet, smooth Porter kind of guy), but to be truthful it seemed in place and melded &#8206;beautifully. 
&#8206; 
I think the beers' context is quite important; it's autumn in GA, and although it NEVER gets &#8206;really cold here, there is a coolness in the air that makes this a PERFECT beer to help me grill &#8206;gourmet burgers on the deck. Absolutely hits the spot. Impressive beer on many levels."
Shmaltz Brewing Company (He'Brew),He'Brew Origin Pomegranate Ale - Barrel-Aged,,,American Strong Ale,?,on-tap,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,10/28/2009,"On tap at The Porter, Atlanta, GA, USA. Left over from a recent He'Brew/Shmaltz event I think. 

&#8206; 

Pour gives a crystal clear, orange body with some wispy lace and head which ultimately settles to &#8206;give a thin white film on top of the beer. Looks nice, a bit like lucozade. Similar to the orginal. 

&#8206; 

Nose has a touch of liquor about it but many a clean edge of alcohol. 

&#8206; 

The tastes are malty and alcohol laden. Drinks very cleanly with a solvent-like finish that again is &#8206;well defined. Not much depth here, the beer drinks a little like a liquer. Warming alcohol on the &#8206;second and third gulp. Some estery fruits as well, but the beer still maintains a level of solvent &#8206;above and beyond the fruit character. 

&#8206; 

I dunno, not much point to this methinks as the beer stands quite well on its own. This version &#8206;seemed a lot less hoppy (in terms of much less grapefruit) but it did maintain some pretty good &#8206;definition and clean lines. I'm happy with the original origin though."
Great Divide Brewing Company,Hoss,,,Märzen / Oktoberfest,6.20%,bottle,3.68,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,10/27/2009,"&#8206;12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA. 
&#8206; 
Delighted to try this as the Marzen style is one of my favorite styles. Paradoxically, rye beers are &#8206;some of my LEAST favorites so the the juxtaposition should be interesting if nothing else! 
&#8206; 
Pour delivers exactly what I am looking for in the style, i.e. a completely crystal clear body with a &#8206;nice white head with some spotty film and lace. Super orange, golden body. 
&#8206; 
Nose gives some edgy malts and some fruity acidity. Some yeast. 
&#8206; 
Tastes continue the aroma trend. Some extra yeast (as expected) as the style demands it IMO. &#8206;Here's the deal, I am delighted that the rye essentially does NOT show up - that's GOOD for me - &#8206;but it seems as though its effect is to diminish the sweet malt character of the beer a little. It's not &#8206;a HUGE problem since we still get plenty of Marzen like notes, but it is not quite as sweet, clear &#8206;and as well defined as most. Why the rye?? 
&#8206; 
The truth here is that the rye doesn't detract too much from the Marzen, but WHY have it AT all? &#8206;I don't get it. The rye only serves to makes this a slightly less good Marzen than it otherwise &#8206;would be - confusing. 
&#8206; 
Note to GD. Take out the rye and brew the Marzen. Why not??&#8206;"
The Bruery,Saison Rue,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,8.50%,bottle,3.2,3,3.5,3,3,3.5,10/23/2009,"Happy to have the opportunity to drink some of The Bruery hyped beers in ATL, doubt they will live up to the hype (it would probably be impossible to do that), but I'll make my own mind up.
750 mL bottle from Mac's, Atlanta, GA, USA. 
Pour gives a slightly burned orange color with plenty of floaties and some murky character. Nose reveals a little funk which is magnified in the taste. Head, lace and retention all poor. No gusher here as others have reported, perhaps earlier carbonation issues have been sorted or just difference in batches.
The tastes remind me a little of Orval. One would think that was a good thing, and it may be, but I am not a huge fan of Orval so it doesn't do much for me. That light funk is in there with some sweetness. In fact it goes a bit sweet and sour on my palate. Carbonation seems a touch high when held against the background of a ""thinnish"" body. Prickly.
To me this is at the edges of what a Saison should be. It lacks the classic notes of spice, and instead delivers more of a Wild Ale/Sour WITH added hops; I bet that many will enjoy and like this, but to me takes something away from the beer. A little too far away from the classic style for me.
Decent, and a solid beer, but not really what I'm looking for in a Saison and as a result a beer that I doubt I will go back much, if at all."
The Bruery,Orchard White,,,Witbier,5.70%,bottle,3.65,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,10/22/2009,"750 mL bottle, Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA. 
Having read some of the previous reviews I decided to open this over the sink and use the 500 mL Tucher Weizen glass as a precaution since I was half expecting a huge gusher and beer everywhere. As it happened, that was not necessary, however it did produce a large amount of annoying foam in the glass. ""Well carbonated"" I would say, but in some ways appropriate.
Hazed, yellow body with great head but not fantastic retention or lace considering the carbonation.
Lemongrass and mild citrus dominate the nose and the tastes and there is a touch of coriander etc. but for me it is VERY muted. Bubbly carbonation continues to produce nice burps and plenty of light, gassy mouthfeel. Almost to the point of feeling champagne like in terms of the body, the beer settles to give a very lemony Wit experience. More lemony that most in the style, and although I did enjoy it the beer is fairly one dimensional.
Delighted to have a sensible ABV in a 750, and in that respect I really enjoyed the beer. Perhaps a strange time of year to be releasing this beer into a new market, especially alongside Autumn Maple, but nevertheless enjoyable and tasty.
Happy to have another beer in one of my preferred styles and happy to have a sensible amount of alcohol in a 750. All in all very heavy on the lemon, lacked a lot of spice notes but I still enjoyed it with ease. Good crossover potential here for newbies."

Very expensive at either $6.50 or $7.00 a pint! Pour gives a very nice, chestnut brown pour with some decent (if short-lived) head but some nice lace. Above average in terms of looks.
Nice malty nose with little nut character but nevertheless sweet and in line with the style.
Simple, tasty, well-crafted a no-nonsense, no frills beer and that's a GOOD thing. In the USA, FAR too often these days it is difficult to track down quality examples of simple, low ABV malt based styles. In that respect this is a God-send. Simple finish with a very moreish character. A touch earthy. Coats the mouth nicely, and has a good taste presence.
A touch thin in the mouth, but perhaps this is a reflection upon the organic angle.
GREAT to find a nice example of a neglected style, and one that lives DOWN to the simplicity of the simple pleasures of simple beer!"

Delighted and surprised, wasn't anticipating getting hold of this. Black dot-matrixed on the neck: PKG on 08/28/09, Best by: 08/2014.
Pour is a pretty bright, darkish bronze color but at the same time not quite as dark as I was expecting. Head is good and fades to give a lovely, creamy, spotty film on the surface of the brew. Classic look.
Nose and tastes give plenty of layered Belgian candy, winter spices and alcohol. The spice is very prominent with a cinnamon pumpkin feel being right up there at the front. If the coriander, orange and cardamon come together I guess that they could produce that....right...?
A little prickle in the mouthfeel from the carbonation and some warming alcohol in the finish. A little Madeira and Bristol Cream sherry add to the depth and the warmth. Nutmeg and mace notes increase in their intensity.
Although the alcohol is pretty well hidden, it still makes its presence felt, and the beer feels full, present and significant.
Increasing sweetness with a touch of burned sugar in the character as well.
Overall, big and warming and although the BSDA categorization is fine, it's so spicy that one could easily file this under ""high alcohol Winter Warmer"". Delicious and a beer to be savored in the cold weather - pity we don't get any of that in Atlanta."

Delighted to come across this; an unexpected and happy surprise.
Beer forms a not especially attractive, Dubbel brown body but is topped with a wispy, white head that is sustained well to leave great lace. appearance redeemed.
I was NOT looking forward to this because I am not a fan of rye at all. HOWEVER, there is absolutely ZERO rye character present - I mean NONE! I guess that may disappoint some people, but for me it was the exact opposite - delighted!
It's quite difficult to describe this beer as a whole. The best I could some up with was a sweet and sour medicinal experience. Not sure if that makes much sense, but it's the best I could muster. Very light cherry note with a light herbal quality too. The beer is clean and sharp with a mild tartness, but NOT in the form of funk - much more in an light acidic manner. At the same time it imparts a fruity sweetness. Definite light cherry esters. Moreish, sweet and smooth as can be.
VERY tasty and insanely drinkable, another superb beer from Brooklyn."
"Pennichuck Brewing Company, Inc.",Engine No. 5,,,Irish Red Ale,5.00%,bottle,4.03,4.5,4,4,4,4,10/18/2009,"12 oz stubbie. $1.50 from Green's, Buford Highway, Atlanta, GA, USA. On their singles shelf; Adam happened to say he was ""unimpresed"" with this. We'll see. ""Brewed in the English Style"", whatever THAT means!
In general, Pennichuck's entry to the Atlanta market has been really quite underwhelming. I'm a huge fan of simple beers, but simple is NOT an excuse for a lucklustre quality.
WOW - this is an EXTRAORDINARY color and pour. A dark, dark, dark brown that is approaching black and reminds me of an English mild. Head is high and tight with a tan color and good lace. Dense.
Nose and tastes give a less impressive (but stil solid) experience with malts taking the lead. The beer seems to lack the classic dry character of an Irish Red and plenty of sweet malts keep coming through including in the sftertaste. Smooth finish and decent beer that could (just) be a sessionable candidate.
The preponderance of malt gives this a much greater brown ale presence than perhaps anyone intended, but if I were doing a blind taste I would say this is closer to a malty brown ale than anything ""red"". Not especially dry and the sweet malts do tend to come through.
Best Pennichuck effort that I've had so far. Not saying a great deal, but nevertheless true. Much work to be done by this brewery in my eyes, but at least a little faith has been restored."
The Bruery,Autumn Maple,,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,10.50%,bottle,3.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,10/18/2009,"Arrived in GA a few days ago so this is my first engagement with the much, much hyped Bruery. In many cases it's not possible for the brewery to control the hype-train, but I'm really not sure how much good all of the hysteria ultimately, actually brings. Ho hum, on to this one. label suggests a five year window for cellaring which is all well and good, but unfortunately there is no date stamp to be found on the bottle.
750 mL, slender neck on the 750 mL bottle (looks a litte like the old Jolly Pumpkin bottles) capped. Purchased from Mac's, Atlanta, GA, USA for approx $9 (I didn't actually look at the price).
Seems like the perfect beer for an Autumnal afternoon (or at least as Autumnal as it ever gets in GA), so I have high expectations for this one.
Pour gives a pretty, bronze body with some chill-haze. Head is bubbly and has a nice, tan colored hue. It has a medium density but doesn't leave much lace. Some thin film on the surface.
Nose yields spice but it's all rather non-descript. Nothing obvious in terms of identification for me.
Tastes have plenty of sweetness and a little diacetyl. I suppose that the sweetness is the maple syrup but again it's not especially easy to identify. Some nice, appropriate, mild burn on the way down. Although the label specifically SHUNS pumpkin, the combo does seem to give a pumpkin note!
Finish is where the alcohol comes through, but it still is well below the advertied 10.5%. For that reason I would describe it as well-hidden.
Overall this beer is fine, but not something I can imagne drinking much of. Not a great deal of Belgian character here and Winter Warmers and (unfortunately Buery peeps) pumpkin comes to mind more than anything."

Description precisely as follows;



80% Altanta Brewing Co. 2007 Winter Ale + 20% Atlanta Brewing Co. Brown Ale, then aged in Jack Daniels barrels since 2007. Described by the brewer/brewery as a ""Sour"" and appears on the Brick Store menu as such, BUT only because it seems difficult to classify, and as it has been fermenting away for a couple of years.



Classified in terms of the closest style available on BA, but fairly inaccurate.



Very dark, still, almost black appearance with no head to speak of. Small film of lace on the surface of the beer. Strong, strong bourbon influenced aroma and same in the taste. About as subtle as a beer of this nature can be, with warming but not overpowering alcohol. Initial sweetness fades to give even more warmth and alcohol in the finish.



No sour notes, just simple a bourbon aged, dark ale with a touch of wild nature about it.



Pretty thin in the mouth.



Not bad, but not really my thing. Fine for what is is and at least it was approachable and drinkale without being obnoxious. Drinkability was good considering everything, but not real easy. A little goes a LONG way here."
Brouwerij De Landtsheer NV,Malheur 12°,,,Quadrupel (Quad),12.00%,bottle,3.93,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,10/16/2009,"330 mL bottle as part of a recent trade - thanks Chad.
Beer pours as expected with a dark brown body, very little head and no lace. The color is a bit of a dirty brown dubbel which, as usual I don't find especially attractive. Not surprising, just not especially attractive.
Alcohol hits the nose with plenty of brown sugar notes as well.
The alcohol does not manifest in the taste quite as strongly as the nose would suggest. Yes, it's there, but it's not hot rather it's laid back with a gentle warming sensation and a light sherry, Madeira note. Classicly formed for the style. The alcohol also seems lower than the ABV would suggest. Only slightly warming on the way down without the burn.
Of course, as suspected the beer increases complexity, depth and enjoyment as it warms. It moves into the digestif category.
To be honest, the mouthfeel is slightly prickly, especially for the style and even after it warms a little. It has a bit too much presnt for my liking but it's not a deal breaker.
All in all, with the possible exception of the mouthfeel and the carbonation, the beer fits nicely into the style and does a pretty nice job."
Nøgne Ø - Det Kompromissløse Bryggeri A/S,Tiger Tripel,,,Tripel,9.00%,bottle,3.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,10/15/2009,"500 mL bottle, Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA. 
Pour yields a really quite yellow, slightly chill-hazed body with some nice white head. Wispy, light lace. Color changes to a darker he when the final yeast sediment is added from the last pour of the bottle.
The nose gives some fairly typical but rather restrained notes. Yes there is some subtle, peppery, alcohol infused character. Some yeastiness with light esters.
Tastes are pretty authentic for the style too. Alcohol prominent BUT at the same time it still drinks well below the 9.0% ABV on the bottle. Very dry, champagne yeast like finish. A little spice but the usual sharp esters and large pepper notes are muted. Yeast repeats its presence over and over again. Quite smooth, it lacks the prickly nature that the alcohol and carbonation can sometimes impart to the style. 
It's actually quite a reserved beer for the style, but the thing that really shines through for me is the dry character. Some vinous notes too. Pretty interesting and I wasn't sure that Nogne could pull this off but they did."

A surpringly, light orange body. Color has some macro characteristics. Head is OK but fades quite badly.



Extremely yeasty in the nose and tastes with some light fruits. The alcohol seems to build a little over the course of the beer. Dry ending with even more yeast. Light esters in the nose which seem more prominent in the smell than the taste. Lingers a little.



Feels pleasing, rich and full in the mouth.



A bit odd in terms of appearance and taste to be honest but it still drinks OK. Fruity and enjoyable but a long way from a traditional version of the style."

The Marzen is, for want of a better word their ""flagship"" brew and as usual it is pretty steady at the relatively new, Buckhead location.



Great clarity on the bright amber body, the beer is lively and vibrant. Head leaves a little to be desired but it's generally acceptable.



Nose gives some quite large malts.



More dryish yeast in the tastes (a GB trademark) but again more bready sweetness.



Not a great deal to report but at the same time a tasty, good value solid beer that I'm never disappointed in. It's a chain brewpub beer and a decent one at that."

A new Trappist, always a time for general excitement...
...actually....hold on! Pour gives a very dark orange/brown body with some high, ice-cream like head. The head is poorly retained though and the lace disappointing. I have no idea why they would want the beer to be as dark either - for me, the color is a turn-off considering the style.
Nose and tastes are really quite sweet. Bubble-gum, yes, but as others have said, I get a lot of pears too. The beer is very mild and sweet and lacks much of an alcohol edge or anything very distinguishable in the Belgian candy or yeast department. The whole thing feels a touch clumsy and without much subtlety or craft. Sweetness has little to temper it and the beer feels unbalanced, almost under-attenuated. Disappointing.
In a word, unimpressed."
"Anheuser-Busch, Inc.",Bud Light Golden Wheat,,,Herbed / Spiced Beer,4.10%,on-tap,2.03,2.5,2,2,3,1.5,10/11/2009,"Exciting times as I ran into this, the latest marketing ploy from AB at the Irish Bred Pub in Douglasville, GA, USA!
Pour reveals a ""dead"" looking beer with less than an sixteenth of an inch of white head on top of a cloudy, butterscotch colored body. Partly due to the poor pour, but nevertheless even with agitation this beer fails to produce much life at all. Disappointing.
Aroma is essentially of nothing. Again the circumstances don't help much (served FROZEN), but even on warming we get next to nothing in terms of smell. Perhaps a really, really weak ""wheatish"" whiff?
The taste is best described as neutral. There IS a tiny, feint spice note in the finish but one really has to really struggle to recognize it as such. In a blind taste I'm not sure that I would be able to pick it up. Before the finish the beer delivers nothing in the way of distinguishable taste at all, except perhaps a ""diet"", lite, malt character.
More, ""marketing rather than beer"" from AB."

Pumpkin beers are a strange beast as far as I am concerned, and this is no exception.
Essentially pumpkin products are virtually unknown in England, and when one considers that amount of pumpkin related stuff that is shoved down your throat in the USA, the contrast is really quite stark. Also, given the disappointment that I had with Prosit and the horrible expeience of the Big DIPA (that was almost undrinkable), I'm a touch wary to say the least. I also had Terrapin's Pumpkinfest a couple of nights ago and it sat very poorly with me too.
Pour here yields a very nice, bright orange body with good clarity. Color is great with good depth. Head fades but leaves a little wispy lace.
Nose has the requisite sice elements but also introduces the classic, band-aid phenol as well.
Tastes are not quite as aggressive as the nose may suggest. Light spices but coupled with a dryish, alcohol based finish. Aftertaste is a touch on the solvent side of things with a lingering turn on the extremeties of the tongue. Burns slightly.
A decent pumpkin but these things are just never going to be my favorite. I don't really get them."

If the truth be known, disappointed considering the usual quality of Left Hand beers and my general enjoyment of the style.
In an O'fest I'm looking for a few key characteristics and this beer fell down on several of them.
Firstly I want a really, bright orange hue with outsanding clarity and an observable carbonation. For me this provided none of those and in fact I would decscribe the beer as being ""muddy"" in its appearance. Decent head and lace though which made up the disappointing color and clarity somewhat.
Secondly in terms of taste, I'm seeking that sweet, malt based sharpness with a clean edge. Again there was a muddy character to the taste with too much going on and a much greater dose of hoppy bitterness than I care for in the style.
For me, the beer lacked definition, and that's a big problem in my O'fest's. I'm looking for sharp, clean lines in appearance and taste and this delivered neither of those very well.
Unoffensive ceratinly, but an average representation of the style in my book."
Rex Beverage Holdings,William Penn Colonial Style Lager,,,American Amber / Red Lager,5.20%,bottle,3.53,3,4.5,3.5,3,3,10/11/2009,"12 oz single from Tower on Buford.
Nice depth of color on the pour, but the carbonation seems a little too lively for the style which in turn produces a scant, over-bubbly head and no lace. A shame because the color looked promising. It quickly dies in the glass.
The nose is pretty amazing. It has a deep, sweet malt presence that almost immediately turns into an old, slightly musty sherry note.
The tase reflect that, and have me reaching for the bottle to see if there is a date on it. There isn't, and this hasn't been in the Atlanta market very long so my suspicion is that this is reasonably fresh. Odd beause these are definitely the kind of tastes that one associates with oxidation and older beer. It's not too much of a problem for me since I generally enjoy those sherry-like notes, but I'm not at all sure that it's supposed to be present here in this beer.
Odd and I'm not sure what to make of this."

I'm on a bit of a budget for beer at the moment (very unusual) but I didn't hesitate to drop the $12.99 &#8206;for the corked & caged 750 mL bottle from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA, despite the fact that the &#8206;sweet potato element makes me raise my eyebrows!
Pour gives a bright orange body, nicely carbonated with good clarity and some excellent, rocky, high &#8206;head.&#8206;
Smell gives lots of peppery bitterness a touch of alcohol and some Belgian yeasts. The beer is quite &#8206;aggressive for an Allagash beer with the emphasis on the spice and peppery bitterness. It smooths out &#8206;beautifully over the course of the beer and becomes increasingly drinkable. The sweet potato is &#8206;conspicious by its absence.&#8206;
Less Saison/Farmhouse given that the funk is very reserved (if at all) in its presence, the beer falls &#8206;firmly into the spicy, peppery Belgian pale area which is an Allagash trademark.&#8206;
Warming alcohol increases on the way down and the beer seems to drink above the advertised 8.3%. &#8206;Although more Belgian Pale than Saison, this beer is an instant classic which reminds me quite a bit of &#8206;Brooklyn Local 1.&#8206;"
Boulevard Brewing Co.,Saison,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,6.20%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,10/10/2009,"750 mL corked and caged affair courtesy of thirdeye11 - thanks Chad.
Pop on opening is encouraging with a good amount of gunsmoke. Proper carbonation in these beers is vital to their success.
Pour gives a fairly standard (but good looking) appearance with some white, frothy head and some decent lace. Body is a clouded, orange marmalade hue with a little chill haze.
Light pepper, low funk and some Belgian yeast in the nose.
The beer is very dry indeed. Not much funk at all, and the white pepper really provides quite a profound bitterness. It all comes together nicely, but this beer lacks much horseblanket or much grassy or earthy character. In that respect I would not call this a classic Saison by any stretch of the imagination although it is a tasty beer. Some lemon notes in the finish but it still seems more bitter than tart to me.
You're going to have to look past the lack of funk, and to enjoy the beer as more of a Belgian Pale or even a beer that's a little like a Belgian IPA, than a classic of the eponymous style. As it warms there is a greater degree of sweetness but the beer never delivers the traditional funk, nor does it leave that dry note completely behind. The finish still has the bitter bite.
Tasty, but not really a classic in the genre but in a way that really doesn't matter."

Dark garnet pour with an minimal amount of lace and head. Very nice color and excellent depth.
Nose is typical for the style with plenty of poorly defined spice but also lots of cinnamon and burned sugar notes.
The beer is a touch bitter but that fits with the style and links the color to the nose to the taste.
Mouthfeel seems a touch prickly on the carbonation.
Plenty of malts in the taste withe ginger talkng a leading role, but the alcohol seems higher than one might expect when reading the label and the combination of malt and spice starts to overwhelm the palate a bit. Tastes get tiring and repetitive, but this is as much a function of the style as it is the beer itself. Gives me a mild headache.

This beer has been described to me in many ways, the most frequent being an ""Imperial Wet Hopped Amber/Red"". Whilst the beer does have the hue of an Amber, AND it does have a nice, wet-hopped presence, when it comes down to it there is little malt/amber presence and the beer falls into a freshly hopped mid-range brew.
I say ""mid-range"", since that for an American hopped beer this is really restrained. There is a degree of similarity between it and an English IPA (with the exception of the ABV).
Dark orange pour that yields a somewhat disappointing head and lace. The nose yields quite gentle hop nose with the emphasis on organic freshness and an edgy grassy nature.
The tastes are really very good. VERY mild in terms of the combination of hops (gentle but assertive) and plenty of sweetness. The sweetness has a real grassy feel to it rather than an Amber malt presence and it is extremely obvious. 
There seems to be a very low level of carbonation but it works very well. Smooth and NON-aggressive, and very drinkable beer. CLEAN and light with a touch of orange.
I was surprised by the gentle touch this beer gave and as such I enjoyed it much more than I thought I would. As a result, I'm going to be one of the BA's that gives this beer one of the higher scores since this beer is subtle and restrained. Not something that is appreciated much around here.
Of course an unnecessarily high ABV. Also, a MORONIC name ultimate reflects the silly, unsophisticated angle that Sweetwater wants to persue, which for me is a great shame."

The pour is an attractive golden body with some decent lace and retention. The carbonation is rather good.
Somewhat sweet nose, but obviously in keeping with the style.
The beer does have some musty notes (possibly age), but the alcohol and white pepper come through nicely. Just about what I would expect for the style. The brew flirts with some cloying sweetness, and the pepper fades to yield sugar but it JUST about holds it together.
I'd like to drink a bottle of this that I KNEW was fresh, but for now this will have to do. It hits a decent note for the style, and although nowhere near my favorite I feel relatively happy with it."

Pour is a highly carbonated one with a peach colored body. The head is light and slightly fizzy with a very slight (but noticeable pinkish hue). Some head and lace, but the noisy carbonation is the most obvious part of the pour.
Some very light fruit and funk in the nose.
The tastes are quite strongly acidic and the fruit is very reserved. There is a touch of funk but again it is very light. The whole thing seems more like acidic fruit than much else. The carbonation lingers. This is not really a Lambic, nor does in feel like a Saison, nor does it feel like a Wild Ale - it's really a pretty interesting combo of all of the above.
It's pretty easy on the palate and in terms of its drinkability. A nice beer and one that you could perhaps present as an example of something outside of the norm to non-BA's. The funk and the acidity drop off a touch as the beer warms and as the palate gets used to the combo. 
Quite tasty. Nice ABV too."

Pour is a rather murky, dark orange affair with a well formed, tight head that is somewhat small. Doesn't seem very lively. Looks a little ordinary. Lace and (and especially) retention are well below average. Disappointed with the lack of clarity and brightness to the beer.
Nose gives up some dryish smelling malts. A little powdery on the aroma.
More dry character in the taste with some hop bitterness. Lacks the malt depth that I'm looking for in the style. Has some peppery notes which seem out of place and in general the lacks any kind of clean edge. A little musty, the beer seems old or tired in some way. Bad characteristics for an O'fest, which, IMO, needs clarity and life - this has neither.
A little boring even if not bad per se. Lacks serious malt character and is a bit dull. I need a fresh, vibrant beer for the style and this simply does not provide it. Pass."

OK, not really what I'm looking for in a label, and a quick visit to the website and seeing this is contract brewed, immediately makes me realize that this 100% about marketing and very little about the beer.
Pour is a macro yellow body with the typical characteristics of non-retained head and hardly any lace. Average carbonation.
Slightly sweet, corny like nose and tastes and although largely unoffensive it could still be just about any, low quality macro. As for ""Cream Ale"", I dunno, seemed largely like a BMC macro clone to me. More sweetness and very watery finish complete the package.
I guess you get what you pay for and what the label suggested I would. It's a shame that the gullibility of the public allows beer marketers to put out this crap. Ho hum. Avoid."
Brouwerij De Molen,1914 Porter,,,English Porter,5.80%,bottle,2.03,3,3,1.5,2,2,10/1/2009,"First tasted at a Brick Store tasting in March of 2009, and subsequently twice more.
This is a VERY odd beer that frankly I don't much care for. I seemed to remember hearing that this was built on an ""original"" or old style recipe for a Porter and if it was I am glad that the style has syubsequently evolved.
The pour yielded a beer that was essentially porter-like, but with the emphasis on brown rathern than black. Head was poor.
Nose was a little non-descript and offered nothing more than a touch of maly sweetness and some typical, roasty notes.
The mouthfeel and tastes are where things started going south for me. Firstly this is basically a very thin Porter. If you want to call it watery then go right ahead, I think that would be appropriate. In terms of the taste there ARE some of the usual Porter characteristics (roasted notes, caramel type malts etc.) BUT the overwhelming experience for me was NUTS! It tasted like someone had taken a whole bunch of crushed hazelnuts and liquidized them. Literally, nuts on top of nuts. I did not like this at all, and thought it was off-putting and basically nasty. It also seemed oddly carbonated for the style.
As I say, IF this is based upon some very old recipes, I am delighted that we have got where we are today with the Porter style as opposed to where were once were.
Value for money is TERRIBLE @ around $15 for the 750 mL bottle that tastes really poor. Avoid."
Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,Sierra Nevada Estate Brewers Harvest Ale,,,American IPA,6.70%,bottle,3.3,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,9/27/2009,"24 oz bottle from Total Wine, Perimeter, Atlanta, GA, USA. $9.99 for the privilege! Second time I've had this.
Pour is a surprisingly red body with a nice high, white rocky head that produces some really nice lace in the glass. Apart from the fact that the body has a rather odd color for an IPA (which may bother some), it looks pretty good.
Nose gives a pretty large dose of resinous, west coast hops with sinus clearing properties. The nose seems really ""green"" and fresh, like a wet-hopped beer.
Tastes reflect the nose but the hops seem a little more citrusy than the nose suggested. Some aggressive grapefruit that doesn't let up much. It's really quite dry and the finish is really quite puckeringly bitter. Lingering coinage metal on the tongue after swallowing. The beer does NOT let up in terms of dry bitterness, and although I didn't feel it up front, by the end of the 24 oz it really begins to feel a touch unbalanced.
Here's the deal with this beer;
I think that the ""estate"" idea a REALLY interesting one and in theory I'm in support of it, BUT there are two significant problems;
(i) This beer that ends up in the glass here is simply NOT that different from umpteen other SN offerings. Take the Anniversary beers, the IPA, the SNPA, Celebration, ESB, Torpedo, the Hop Harvest, Southern Hemi etc. etc., we have LOADS of pretty good (with the exception of the ESB), hop based, IPA style clones that simply DON'T make sufficient distinctions between themselves to make any of them stand out. Ultimately this is just ANOTHER hop-based, SN beer that is not *bad* as such but seems SO run-of-the-mill. In that respect, at least on the first bottling, this experiment/project is a failure. NOW, IF this leads to bigger, better and greater things in the future then I may change my mind but for now the effort (and the extra cost) was simply not worth it! Having said all of that, I would REALLY love the estate idea to take off.
(ii) When you consider my comments in (i) above, AND you realize that this beer costs the equivalent of over $30 per sixer, it makes the whole situation INSANE! I'm NOT debating that the costs involved in producing this beer are higher, but rather I am saying that those extra costs (ultimately passed on to the consumer) are simply TOTALLY unjustified when you consider the product that ends up in the glass. There are countless other beers that will give you the same (or better) experience (some of them by SN themselves!), for less than one-third of the cost. It just doesn't add up - not even close. Maybe one day, but not now.
If I were scoring this in relation to the extra effort relating to what's in the glass, OR the value for money, then it's a CLEAR, F!
In summary I WANT the estate concept to work but if it is going to it will have to produce beers that are much more distinct than this one is. This is not a bad beer, but at an equivalent of $30 a sixer it is a total failure. We'll see..."
Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Weihenstephaner Festbier,,,Märzen / Oktoberfest,5.80%,bottle,3.35,2.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,9/26/2009,"12 oz single from Total Wine, Perimeter, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Poured into the Tucher Weizen glass, the color is alarmingly light for the style. The pour is largely a macro yellow color and lacks the kind of extra added orange, amber depth that one would expect to find in a Marzen. Strike one.
There is some nice carbonation with plenty of streaming bubbles and some decent head, but the lace and retention are only average.
Tastes are a little corny and little too sweet, malt liquor like for my liking. It lacks much depth or character and there is a distinct absence of those high quality sweet malts that one would normally expect from the style. I need a touch more Bock-like notes (greater and higher quality malt depth). Having said that I quite enjoyed drinking it, BUT I think that was because I was really craving a beer when I drank it.
Very surprised to be so disappointed in this. It wasn't ""bad"" as such but I was looking for much more malt depth and a darker color."
Jolly Pumpkin Artisan Ales,Weizen Bam,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,4.50%,bottle,4.28,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,9/26/2009,"Jolly Pumpkin and Ron Jefferies remain a huge enigma to me; I just DON'T want funk in styles that shouldn't have funk! It makes no sense and it's an abuse of styles. Of course, this is a beer where it will be somewhat/definitely appropriate, so I have high expectations.
750 mL bottle from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA. Batch 411/412.
Pour is a lovely, yellow, light butterscotch body with a bit of disappointing head (in terms of height, retention AND lace). Nose has some light funk, light horse-blanket and mild acidity. All VERY much in order.
Similarly with the tastes the funk and acidity are nicely in check. Plenty of light lemon zest and green apple cider notes, very nice and very appropriate for the style. Some greenish hay notes and the beer feels fresh, vibrant and lively. good stuff exploding on the tongue.
A simple but excellent beer in the style. Nothing to report other than a classy, well crafted beer that hits all the right notes for the style. 
A pleasing experience for me because this is a style (and a beer) that JP should STICK TO; leave the Belgian styles, Stouts and other stuff to the experts and do what YOU do best.
Tasty and put your funk in the funky styles!"
Pennsylvania Brewing Company,St. Nikolaus Bock Bier,,,Bock,7.50%,bottle,3.95,4,4,4,3.5,4,9/26/2009,"12 oz single from a recent trade.
In a nutshelll a very simple and nice example of the style with a slight twist.
Pour gives a mahogany based body with a reserved head but some nice lace.
The nose has a twang, perhaps from the spice notes that may (or may not) be present, and a touch of alcohol. Malts start to come through even in the aroma.
The tastes are typical for the style with malts taking the lead,. Quite smooth with a little bit of orange peel. The finish brings a touch of bitterness which may be the citrus peel, may be the alcohol or may be remnants of some hop presence.
Mouthfeel is not big, but nor should it be. There's some light carbonation which is a bit prickly.
Good stuff, enjoyable and a nice winter beer."
Ridgeway Brewing,IPA,,,English India Pale Ale (IPA),5.50%,bottle,4.33,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,9/26/2009,"500 mL bottle that was $4.99 purchased on a recent visit to Asheville, NC, USA. For some reason, although we get a few Ridgeway beers in Georgia, this one has never shown up. Delighted to get my hands on it.
Pour is a very light golden body underneath a high, well retained, lace producing, white head. Surprising level of carbonation (perhaps too much).
Nose and tastes gives the classic biscuit soft malts. This is followed by that typical, subtle hop bitterness which lingers and leaves the classic, English IPA aftertaste. Beautiful. Several large gulps just leave me wanting more, and the beers' moreish qualities quickly come to the fore. Easy drinking, possibly even ""light"", imagine (pseudo)-sessioning this on a moderately warm English summer afternoon at the cricket - heaven! I love the way it lingers.
A delicious beer in the bottle, but another example of beer that would almost certainly be even better closer to the source and on cask. Nevertheless, still great from the bottle."
Smuttynose Brewing Company,Smuttynose Star Island Single,,,Belgian Pale Ale,5.80%,bottle,3.65,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,9/26/2009,"Having spent a large part of my beer drinking youth in Belgium, and visiting literally scores of times over the years, AND have the privilege of hanging out with some natives, I grew to really appreciate and enjoy the art of the simple Belgian Pale Ale, AKA the ""Single"".
A style that is not easy to catch up with in the USA with its obsession with huge ABV beers, but the kind of thing that one could expect to buy in a gas station in BE. Enough reminiscing and back to THIS beer;
12 oz bottle as (appropriately enough) a single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour is a mid-golden body with a slightly disappointing head situation.
Nose has a rather bland feel and again is slightly disappointing.
Mouthfeel is a little prickly, but I like the life in it.
Tastes have a touch of Belgian yeast and a little corriander. It's all very restrained but at the same time it seems very appropriate to me. Pretty dry with a satisfying finish and aftertaste. a bit more bitterness and dry character than one might expect, but nevertheless very acceptable. Not a beer that packs a huge punch but nor should it be. Nice.
Good, simple stuff with lots of crossover potential."
Terrapin Beer Company,Terrapin Midnight Project Depth Charge Espresso Milk Stout,,,Milk / Sweet Stout,7.00%,bottle,4.28,4,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,9/25/2009,"22 oz bottle, $7.49 from Total Wine, Perimeter, Atlanta, GA, USA. #2 in the Midnight Project, Terrapin/Left Hand collaboration. Deliberately avoided this at Brewgrass as I wanted to try it for the first time, properly. Gold foil on the neck.
No surprise on the pour, a pure black with tan espresso like head. Some lace.
There's actually EXTREMELY little to report here - this is in NO way a complex beer. That doesn't make it *bad*, it just means it is what it is. 
The nose and tastes are basically those chocolate covered espresso beans. A strong, slightly smoked, bitter chocolate based espresso combo and very little else. The coffee is VERY strong, but at the same time it is not oppressive. It really tastes like a very high quality, sweetened espresso. There is very little lactose or milk stout character here for me, rather this is simply liquid chocolate espresso beans.
EXTREMELY light in the mouth too, not remotely viscous and one might even say *thin* when one considers the type of beer this is. In fact it's really only the carbonation (with a touch of warming alcohol) that distinguishes this from BEING coffee. Perhaps that is a bit harsh, after all is is NOT supposed to be an Imperial Stout, but the coffee combo can trick the mind into expecting a much larger beer overall. I think that I may have fallen victim of the American obsession with large eveything!
This is one of the few beers that one can truly consider to be a ""coffee"" beer and not much else. This is SUCH a good ""coffee"" replicator that it might even impress people that DON'T like coffee. Quite a feat to make beer actually BE coffee! Very drinkable, try it with a doughnut or a bagel!"
Spoetzl Brewery,Shiner Smokehaus,,,Munich Helles Lager,4.90%,bottle,3.45,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,9/22/2009,"OK, mixed reviews on this one I see, let's have a go.
12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA. Pour is a decent, somewhat frothy, typical for the Helles style yellow. Head was average with some retention and lace.
Nose gives away very little except a touch of smoke and some malty sweetness. The tastes reflect this fairly faithfully but with the smoke playing a larger part. An interesting combination of tastes that frankly struggles a bit to settle on the palate but it's not unpleasant. Definitely would benefit from some snacks alongside this one.
As with smoked beers of ANY description, these are generally complimented with food, the heartier the better.
Overall enjoyable, and although this is obviously not a beer like a smoked porter or even a classic German rauch, it does have a certain autumnal, winter, grilling, BBQ type appeal that might even start a few conversations,. Not bad at all."
Highland Brewing,Highland Big Butte Smoked Porter,,,American Porter,7.00%,bottle,3.95,4,4,4,3.5,4,9/21/2009,"$4.99 for the 22 oz bomber from Asheville Wine Market on the Brewgrass trip.
2009 Highland Cup Winner, look out for this in the GABF Pro-Am competition.
Poured into the Brewgrass sampler glass in small doses. Solid if unspectacular mahogany body with some nice lace left behind by the mocha head.
Nose has some solid, caramel sugary notes but a lack of much that one would call smoky. Sweetness comes through the more you sniff it.
Tastes are really quite significantly bitter but not in a really unpleasant way. If you were looking for extensive smoke content (which obviously one WOULD be given the presentation), I think that you may be a bit disappointed. The slightly charcoal bitterness was the main feature rather than much smoke. Plenty of roasty malts, but these come through in a stout bitterness kind of manner rather than the smoke angle. Definitely some bitter, bitter chocolate.
Putting aside the lack of real smoke content, this drank very nicely and had a slightly hoppy note which created a distinct bitterness. On a blind taste taste this would resister with my palate as a stout, and the creamy, soft note that I am looking for in my Porters was missing a little. In that respect there are American stamps all over it.
Think edgy, less sweet, less rich Tasgall.
Despite that, the drinkability was good and I enjoyed the beer, just don't expect big ""Rauch"" content and you'll probably enjoy it."
Clipper City Brewing Co. / Heavy Seas Beer,Heavy Seas - Big DIPA,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,10.60%,bottle,2,4.5,2,1.5,4,1.5,9/17/2009,"22 oz bottle form Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Let me say right off the top that I love sweeter beers and beers that are malt based, BUT....this is a disaster in terms of sweetness and taste.
The look is strong. A really nice clarity to the orange amber body and surprisingly good head, retention and lace considering the style. Rather well carbonated as well and a decent mouthfeel.
The nose reveals a solvent like, paint-stripper, alcoholic assault which does not bode well. Sinus clearing and NOT in a good, hop-ridden resionous way, more of a rubbing alcohol way. Nasty.
Given the nose, I was expecting a horrible alcoholic rip of the senses. Actually that did not materialize but a malt soaked, totally sugar drenched, completely unbalanced detergent like flavor DID. Uuuggghhh....even my well developed sweeter liking palate could not cope with this. Awful. As well as the crushing sweetness we get a weird, soap-like astringent bitterness which is probably the hop content trying desperately to get out of the bottle and escape death by sugar!
I found this close to impossible to drink and 3/4 of the bottle went down the drain. It's giving me a headache just thinking about it. Terrible in terms of the tastes, nose and drinkability (the most important factors). Wow, and not in a good way. Reminiscent of a badly brewed barleywine."
Smuttynose Brewing Company,Smuttynose Gravitation (Big Beer Series),,,Quadrupel (Quad),12.00%,bottle,4.43,4,4,4.5,4,5,9/17/2009,"Bought this 22 oz bottle a couple of months ago at Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA. I've been holding on to it for a little while waiting for the moment that I felt like drinking a bomber full of a Quad - last night was that time.
Beer poured with a lovely, reddish hue with some real deep brown highlights. The head was decent on the aggressive pour and the foam left behind was creamy and made of fine bubbles giving a really smooth experience. Nose revealed virtually no alcohol but there were plenty of dark fruits. The raisin and rich, rum notes made up the majority of the initial tastes with a slight (very slight) acidity in the background. LOTS of rich, dark fruits all over the place.
The smells and tastes were similar to one another with heaps of brown sugar, sherry and Madeira notes. Sherry and mild alcohol manifest themselves nicely in the finish too.
This is a complex beer which is right up there amongst some of the better Belgians in the style. I'm NOT saying that this is a Westy 12 or a Rochefort 10, but it's in that territory and to be honest I doubt that it would look out of place amongst those beers in a tasting.
EXTREMELY drinkable consider the ABV and the style, and I got through this a little quicker than I wanted to. A super beer that exceeded my expectations by quite some distance. A very, very good brew."
Einbecker Brauhaus AG,Einbecker Schwarzbier,,,Schwarzbier,4.90%,bottle,3.95,4,4,4,3.5,4,9/16/2009,"Purchased from The Vintage Cellar, Blacksburg, VA, USA. Notch on the back label has the ""06"" cut out! Old? Difficult to tell to be honest.
Poured with a decent amount of mocha colored head and a surprisingly reddish body. It looks good but under no circumstances would one call this black, and to be honest it has the appearance of a brown ale; a good brown ale, but a brown ale nevertheless. Decent lace and retention.
The nose and tastes are obviously very malty (as per the style and in line with Einbecker beers in general) and there is plenty of sweetness too. Hop balance is at a minimum of course.
Definite organic, musty, earthy notes as well. This MAY be connected to the age of the beer, but without further information it is difficult to tell.
Delighted with the lower ABV and the drinkability despite the suspect age of the bottle.
All in all, definitely NOT as ""black"" as I was expecting, and definitely drank more like an English brown ale rather than anything else. Despite these attributes I still enjoyed it very much."
Nashoba Valley Winery,Imperial Stout,,,Russian Imperial Stout,8.20%,bottle,3.78,3.5,3.5,4,3,4,9/16/2009,"If I had to sum up this 12 oz, single bottle offering simply, I would say that is has most of the general attributes of the style, but it lacked any real depth in every department. Summarized thus;
 + A blackish pour, but lacked any significant viscosity or motor oil color
 + Body felt fairly light and especially light for the style
 + Alcohol seemed well below the 8.2% advertised; unusual for a RIS
 + Nose and tastes had some of the roasty character that one would expect, but ultimately the characteristic, style bitterness was not there
All in all the beer was completely non-offensive but actually tasted like a slightly watered down version of the style.
I wouldn't say that I didn't enjoy it, I actually thought it was pretty drinkable, approachable, light and sensible in many ways, but American lovers of the RIS style would be very disappointed I suspect. Englishmen will probably tolerate this a little more, but even for me there is no doubt that this is a lightweight version of a style that really needs more presence."
Cervejaria Sudbrack Ltda,Eisenbahn S.A.P.A. (South American Pale Ale),,,Belgian Pale Ale,5.10%,bottle,2.55,2.5,3,2.5,3,2,9/12/2009,"12 oz single from Green's on Ponce, $1.99 for the bottle - pretty sure that they are just trying to shift this stuff since it has obviously been a very poor seller for them.
Pour is quite an orangey golden one with a distinct lack of head, retention or lace. Makes the beer feel flat (although there is a little carbonation in the mouth) but overall lackluster.
Has a bit of an adjunct, macro feel about it and quite where any elements of Belgian candy or yeasts are I don't know. The beer is basically a run-of-the-mill, uninspiring paleish ale with little to distinguish it from the pack. Simple malts make up the majority of the tastes and hops are conspicuous by their absence. Very light in the flavor department - never a good thing!
Perhaps an older bottle, but without freshness dates I always feel justified in reviewing - how do the brewers expect us to know otherwise.
Nothing to report here, a beer that is lost in a sea of mediocrity."
Cervejaria Sudbrack Ltda,Eisenbahn Dourada (Kölsch),,,Kölsch,4.80%,bottle,3.3,2.5,3,3.5,4,3,9/12/2009,"12 os single from Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA. Part of a big clearance that they have been having of these beers. The final one of the four 12 oz presentations (they have had Lust, too) that Green's have been carrying.
Well, I dunno; Kolsch? I suppose that we can argue over the extendability of the style guidelines but to me this takes things a bit too far.
The pour gives a color which I feel is too dark. It's really quite oraange. Secondly the malt dominance is just too great for me. The problem here is that when this happens the beer goes into ""less crisp mode"", and the refreshing, Saaz like bites that I am seeking in the style seem to go away.
The carbonation seemed about right for the stated style and as a result the mouthfeel was good, but overall I cam away with the impression of a beer well out of style.
Having said that I thought it was a decent drink even if it left me scratching my style head slightly.
I'm looking for a much cleaner, crisper angle on a beer that is categorized as a Kolsch and this didn't provide it. For that I'm going to mark the drinkability down, and I would also take style points away. That said, I could enjoy a few of these IF I could forget it was being present as a beer inspired for Cologne!"
Left Hand Brewing Company,Polestar Pilsner,,,German Pilsener,5.50%,bottle,2.2,4,2,2,3,2,9/12/2009,"12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
In summary I was very surprised at how ""macro"" like this was. There were very large corn and vegetal notes in both the nose and the tastes, and a really distinct lack of sharp, crisp hop notes. 
The lack of Saaz crispness and the lack of cleanliness are big problems when it comes to a PIls beer, and to be honest this was seriously lacking n both departments.
The pour and appearance were promising enough with a decent, if not huge head sitting on top of a golden yellow body. Good carbonation.
A pretty poor Pilsner and a beer that reminded me of macro lagers a little too much. It felt low quality."
Lazy Magnolia Brewing Company,Reb Ale,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,5.40%,bottle,2.83,2.5,3,3,2.5,2.5,9/10/2009,"12 oz bottle, thanks go out to Jason for the chance to try this.
""Greatest Nation on Earth"" (usual ""USA, USA"" crap) on the label that ignores so much....ho hum...back to the beer.
Nice color that has plenty of depth in the orange color but has a terrible lack of head, retention and lace. Seems quite highly carbonated for the style. A little prickly in the mouth.
Nose has some light orange and some mild hops.
The beer is very light and has a touch of light hops. It's so light it feels perhaps a touch watery. Finish has a little bitterness but to be honest it's very muted and unimpressive. 
Quite ordinary but at the same time it's not badly crafted but it still is utterly forgettable."
River Horse Brewing Co.,Hop-a-lot-amus,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,8.50%,bottle,2.55,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,9/10/2009,"12 oz single.
A hazed and murky orange brown body results from an aggressive pour. Small head with decent retention forms quickly to leave some decent lace. Looks OK but body and color is not really attractive.
Nose and tastes are a largish, fragrant hop based assault with decent malts but ultimately even out to be just a bit ""blah"". Frankly we've seen it all before with these over-hopped, off balance DIPA's and this is just another that's gonna get lost in the mix for me. Lots of pine and really not much else, it's strange how beers like this seem to have captured the American palate. It must be the effect of prohibition and the bland macro water that dominates the scene.
Resinous repetition gets a bit much for me as the beer drinks and ultimately I pour it away through boredom more than anything else."
Stone Brewing Co.,Stone 09.09.09 Vertical Epic Ale,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,8.60%,bottle,3.83,4.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,9/10/2009,"Suprised to see so few reviews of this (only 5 at the time of writing), since I've had this in my posession since last week.
First time that I've drunk a VE on the actual day!
Pour has a jet black body with a lovely, high head with fine bubbles. The bubbles are extremely fine in the way that creates that almost perfect, horizontal line between the body and the head that one finds in many nitro pour beers, or more commonly in Guinness. The head is not amazingly well retained, but it does leave some superb lace and a nice, spotty mocha film on the surface of the beer, with extra density in the middle of the beer. Looks very good.
Nose has some nice, chocolately notes with a very light touch of bitter hops.
The initial tastes go WAY beyond a Belgian Strong Dark and easily slips into a Belgian Stout (or even just into regular stout) areas. The beer really doesn't seem especially ""spicy"" to me at all, rather it really gets to be quite bitter both in the middle & the finish, and in the aftertaste. I might even go as far as to say that there is a touch of charcoal in there. I'd heard rumors of oranges, porters, spices and Belgian IPA's when others have been describing this beer and its tastes, but to be honest I get NONE of these. In fact, I don't really get any Belgian yeast notes either, and quite frankly although the beer is not bad, it seems a little disappointing to me. It's just not very complex beer at all; it's a nice stout with plenty of roasty bitterness, and it's a nice version of that kind of beer, but as far as all the other claims it seems to fall short.
As it warms and the bottle is consumed the beer becomes slightly less stout-like and the beer thins out in the mouth to feel slightly more BSDA like, but it STILL feels ""stoutish"" more than anything else.
I dunno, not especially complex and in that respect a little disappointing and definitely not Belgian in the way that it drinks.
It's a nice, roasty, light drinking stout to me and that's about it."
Fort Collins Brewing,Retro Red,,,American Amber / Red Ale,5.20%,bottle,3.65,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,9/7/2009,"12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour is interesting simply because it produces exactly the kind of beer in the glass that I am looking for. It's a very noisy, rich pour with a creamy carbonation that leads to a reddish, mocha like foam on top of the body. The color of the body is a touch muddy, and lacks the absolute, crystal clear, garnet colored body that I would like, but it's not bad. Head is better looking than the body.
Outside of that the beer performs quite well within the style guidelines. Nice and malty with some quite serious hop overtones, the beer comes together well and provides a good balance of biter sweet notes. Trademark, traditional dryish ending adds to the experience.
Aftertaste is again a little ill-defined, but all in all a solid beer within the style."
Mikkeller,Tjekket Pilsner (AKA Czech-style Pilsner),,,Czech Pilsener,4.80%,bottle,1.88,2,2.5,1.5,3,1.5,9/7/2009,"Well, what a strange brew.
Let's start with the price. This was $9.99 for the 12 oz bottle from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA. I spoke with Kraig at length about this and he assured me that this was correct. Seems bizarre.
The pour is a bit odd as well. Rather than getting a lovely, crystal clear, golden body we get a cloudy, butterscotch colored pour with a high bubbly head. To be honest, it looks more like a Hefe that anything else. Odd and not Pils like by any stretch of the imagination.
The nose gives away a little smoke(?) which is then massively exaggerated in the taste. I really don't understand it. By the end of this beer I feel as though I am almost drinking a smoked beer. Very odd. There are a few pepper highlights as well and a acrid, bitter, smoke filled finish. I'm confused.
The smokiness in the taste for this beer is a bit beyond my comprehension. I did not drink it in a smoky environment, nor did I drink it following a smoked beer, not did I drink it with smoked food. The whole thing is crazy. Either way I didn't like it much and the beer had a very poor drinkability for me. Coupled with the price, value = 0.
I dunno, someone will have to explain this to me."
Southampton Publick House,Southampton Triple Abbey Style Ale,,,Tripel,8.00%,bottle,3.33,3,3.5,3.5,2,3.5,9/6/2009,"22 oz bottle.
One of my favorite styles from a brewer that usually does a great job, this looks promising.
Pour is odd. Lots of large bubbles in the carbonation, but this leads to virtually no head, no retention and obviously no lace. It looks a bit dead in the glass. Disappointing from the carbonation angle. Color is a beautiful, deep orange color but even considering the ABV it seems lifeless.
The mouth feel confirms the lack of carbonation, and while I wouldn't call the beer ""flat"" I feel it need some more ""uuuummphh"".
Nose has some sweet Belgian notes with yeast. A lot of orangey alcohol too.
Tastes are that of some warming alcohol and some white pepper notes. Some yeast in the back end and a touch of Belgian candy. Some extra bubblegum comes through too. Triple like but seems to drink a little under the ABV. In that respect easy to put away.
The lack of sustained carbonation is a big problem here and it lets the beer down quite badly.
Nowwhere near the best beer that Southampton puts out, this needs an overhaul IMO."
Brouwerij De Troch,Chapeau Framboise Lambic,,,Lambic - Fruit,3.50%,bottle,4.43,4,5,4.5,4,4,9/5/2009,"The 12 oz, mini champagne bottle with dimpled bottom and capped and corked presentation (along with the somewhat cheesy label), is impressive. This bottle came from Camp Creek Beverage near the Airport, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour is quite well carbonated and gives a brownish, red body with a decent amount of carbonation, retention and lace. Looks promising.
The nose on this beer is AMAZING. It takes me back to my childhood where the aroma of Hartley's raspberry jam come FLOODING back. Strong, sweet raspberries fill the nostrils, truly extraordinary.
There's very little subtlety in the taste and that's OK. This is a raspberry cocktail, even an alcopop and if you are looking for a lambic in the traditional, sour context forget it. Up front it as it leasts as sweet as a Lindeman's and although the back end of the beer does show a little more restraint, basically this is a sugar bomb and I rather like it! Slightly musty in the final analysis but that may be something to do with the age of the beer. No date on this bottle, but I know it's not young.
Drinkability is massive for 12 oz, but would drop off dramatically after that - I went for a compromise in that department! 
Many will HATE this, I rather liked it. Tasty."
Brouwerij De Troch,Chapeau Exotic,,,Lambic - Fruit,3.50%,bottle,2.1,2,2,2,3,2,9/5/2009,"12 oz, champagne style, dimpled bottomed bottle. Capped and corked.
Pop on opening is disappointing, suspiciously flat. 
Pour gives a golden body with just about ZERO head, retention or lace. Looks dead.
The nose has a strange mixed fruit note with bananas and pineapple apparently present.
The tastes are strangely solvent like (despite the low ABV) and it lingers to give a touch of plastic amongst the pineapple.
I love pineapple but to be honest this is pretty nasty. It has a strong solvent like alcohol presence which is certainly odd and it taste of some kind of estery, chemical lab concoction. It is true that the age of the bottle is suspect, but without dates I feel justified in reviewing it.
Not good at all. Avoid."
Brouwerij De Troch,Chapeau Peche,,,Lambic - Fruit,3.00%,bottle,1.48,2,1.5,1.5,2,1,9/5/2009,"Oh gosh, not at all good.
Like the ""Exotic"" version in this series, the pop on opening is disappointing, and the beer remains suspiciously flat.
Pour gives a dark golden or amber body with just about ZERO head, retention or lace. Like the pineapple version, it looks dead.
The nose has a really musty, old aroma. No freshness date though.
Good grief, a sharp, acidity meets the palate and coupled with some sweetness and the earthy, old notes we have a mess. Some metal coinage lingers on various parts of the tongue too. This is not at all good.
Not good at all. Possibly an old bottle but again, without freshness dates what is a reviewer to do?"
Lagunitas Brewing Company,A Little Sumpin' Extra! Ale,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,8.70%,bottle,4.3,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,9/5/2009,"22 oz bomber from Green's, Atlanta, GA, USA.
What I like about Lagunitas is their simple adherence to style and the great value that one usual gets, especially in the bomber size.
Pour is a bright, golden, clear body with a high, bubbly head. The head leaves some superb, sticky lace which is exactly what I am looking for in a big 'ol American DIPA. For me the sticky nature of the lace is a VERY important feature of an American DIPA.
Nose gives plenty of sinus clearing, sweetened grapefuit, resinous hop notes. Tastes are very much in the same vein but the bitterness is absent in huge quantities, rather we get a sweet hoppy beer with just about as balanced a beer as one can hope for in this style (OF COURSE, it's NOT balanced at ALL, but that's the nature of the style!)
Surprisingly smooth, creamy mouthfeel and some nice, simple aftertastes that shy away from palate abuse!
In summary very drinkable and a beer that is just about as abalanced as one can expect given the style. As I say it isn't balanced per se, but it is a beer with significant malts to back up the hop profile. A subtle as the style will ever get!"
"Peak Organic Brewing Company, LLC",Peak Pomegranate Wheat Ale,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,6.00%,bottle,3.53,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,9/5/2009,"12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Beer pours with a golden body, a lot of clarity considering the wheat (filtered?) and a decent enough head and lace. Some carbonation streams from the bottom of the glass.
Nose and tastes are very much like cream soda. Not much fruit to speak of but plenty of sweet, wheat notes. I was half expecting red colortion to the beer and some strong fruit notes but neither were there. Cream sod flavoring is really quite strong and gets repeated.
Tasty and refreshing, and nice, ""no-too-fruity"" option for the summer but at the same time a beer that offers little else. Glad to see competent brewing and a beer that is tasty and drinkable, but nothing to stunning to remember. I'd think a good candidate for knocking the ABV down a touch or two as well."
Great Divide Brewing Company,Chocolate Oak Aged Yeti,,,American Double / Imperial Stout,9.50%,bottle,3.68,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,9/4/2009,"22 oz bomber.
Having read a few reviews and considered the beer myself, I got a touch nervous about the combination of chocolate and oak. Frankly, these elements have the potential to be fighting one another in the tastes and this could be a difficult marriage.
Poured into the 22 oz, Terrapin snifter in several, small pours, the beer forms the expected look. Black body with a few dark brown highlights at the edges. Nice head initially, but this fades to a spotty, fine film on the surface of the beer with little or no lace.
Nose gives some alcohol, a touch of woody vanilla and a hint of chocolate.
The tastes do pretty much the same. The oaky, vanilla complements the minimal chocolate well, but then it kicks in some extra dry character and an ending which is also dry. This is a really close call, and although the oak doesn't really HELP the beer IMO, it also manages not to hinder it - I thought it may have done that. Aftertaste lingers and little and there is a mild, chest burn in the finish.
Alcohol is an element, but feels quite well hidden for me. Chocolate is muted but at the same time it's part of the beer. Frankly I would much prefer this without the woody oak AND with more chocolate, BUT even with this slight shortcoming it was not bad as I was concerned it might be.
Not perfect, and in my mind it could be better, however still a drinkable beer (better than expected) that I enjoyed sipping over the course of a couple of hours."
Founders Brewing Company,Founders Cerise,,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,6.50%,bottle,3.83,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,9/3/2009,"12 oz single as part of a recent haul in Virginia. Stubbie bottle as per Founders presentation.
A difficult to describe color; something between a mauve, hazed purple and the skin of light colored plum. Head is minimal, lace follows suit.
Nose gives little away apart from simple malts, a touch of grain and a non-descript fruit character that one would not necessarily grasp as being cherry based.
Tastes give a very muted cherry experience, and again not one that would stand out as being a potent cherry. It does have an authentic feel though, and the beer gives a dry, slightly tart fruit experience which is subtle, tasty and controlled.
A beer that is interesting and manages to be fruity by still very ""beer based"" with the fruit taking a backseat. Unlike some fruit beers this not especially ""fruity"" but it does bring the character of the cherry skins and dry, tart notes to the table."
Weyerbacher Brewing Co.,Verboten,,,Belgian Pale Ale,5.90%,bottle,3.18,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,9/3/2009,"12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Hazed, darkish orange pour with a small head that fades pretty quickly; minimal lace. Some chill haze.
Nose has a touch of alcohol, some peppery spice, a little estery fruit as well.
The tastes are an odd composite of lots of differnt strong flavors. Firstly we get some serious bubblegum and fruit. Mixed in there is some peppery, bitter alcohol and then some apparently bitterish hop bite in the finish! Really odd. This beer feels like a beer that is a cross between a Tripel, a Belgian IPA and a dryish hop based Pale Ale. It misses on most of these notes, and although the beer is drinkable I'm confused and a bit frustrated by it.
The finish is dry and there are more bubblegum tastes that are really quite strong.
I don't dislike this but it's a strange combination of tastes and experiences. Not sure that it's a good beer, but I guess it's interesting."
Founders Brewing Company,Founders Porter,,,American Porter,6.50%,bottle,2.98,3.5,3,3,2.5,3,9/2/2009,"12 oz stubbie as per usual with Founders.
Pour is surprisingly motor oil-like. From appearance one might have said that this beer was a stout or even a RIS. Quite viscous considering the style.
Head is poorly formed with no head and no lace. From that, I get the impression that this has a higher ABV than 6.5%. Confusing.
This is absolutely an AMERICAN porter. It has far too harsh a hop profile for me and its roasty, bitter notes take me to a place that I do not want to go with a Porter. I'm looking for a much creameier, soft angle in my Porters and this fails to make the grade for me. Some chocolate notes in the finish but again more bitterness drives across the palate.
Many (American BA's) will love this, I don't."
SweetWater Brewing Company,Sweetwater Dank Tank Big Ol' Belgian Blue Balls,,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,8.00%,bottle,4.08,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,9/1/2009,"22 oz bottle with the same basic artwork as the bottled DP but with a blue & white theme rather than the red & white. $5.79 from Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA. I agree that the associated text on the bottle in relation to the name has simply gone too far and is in purely bad taste. I'm not offended, but to call it juvenile would be an understatement. It does craft beer no favors.
Back to the contents...
....decent gunsmoke on releasing the cap and good hiss. Beer is well carbonated that leads to a head that is small but well formed. Retention of the head is not great and very little lace.
Body is a very light copper color with some good clarity.
Nose has some quite strong, fruity esters and a decent amount of alcohol.
Quite sweet, but definitely with a good dose of Belgian yeast. To me this is not especially ""Blueberry"" in its make-up but it definitely has a strong , ester based, sweet, alcoholic edge. Light acidity too. Plenty of trademark Belgian candy notes that perhaps have a source in the natural sugars in the fruit??
Very tasty (in a non-blueberry way), very smooth and a lovely alcoholic warmth in the end and aftertaste.
VERY drinkable and a beer that is reminiscent of a Tripel with a touch of pepper in there too. A little solvent like alcohol but in a good way. I really thought that this was delicious and seemed to drink with a punch. Goes down real easy and lacks any cloying nature that I was a bit concerned about.
Better beer than the nonsense on the bottle and the name would suggest."
Brasserie Fantôme,Fantôme Pissenlit,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,8.00%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,8/30/2009,"750 mL corked and capped bottle.
Pour gives a mid-orange body with some white head and a little lace. 
Nose reveals a fairly potent, acidic and lemon based smell. The aroma seems ""tart"" (if that's possible)!
The tastes are all acid with slightly, under-ripe, green apples coming to mind. ANOTHER funky, Fantome Saison that is basically almost exactly like a dry, Devonshire/Somerset scrumpy. The similarity is unmistakable and unavoidable.
Light carbonation that invigorates the tongue, and together with the acidity the beer really livens up the palate. As the bottle is consumed, the beer becomes less tart and the funk evens out a little. The finish is sharp and abrupt and does not linger. Some hay, classic barnyard funk & manure and grassy acidity. No alcohol present in the taste.
If you are not into the acidity of a typical, traditional English cider then you need to leave this beer alone. IF on the other hand you are a fan of rustic, organic-like beverages that have an edgy, unrefined touch then this is going to work well for you; either way it's tasty."
De Struise Brouwers,Pannepot - Old Fisherman's Ale,,,Quadrupel (Quad),10.00%,bottle,3.48,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,8/30/2009,"11.2 oz bottle, 2007 vintage.
I've had this a couple of times before, now time for a formal review.
Pour gives a rich, dark brown body with a mocha, coffee colored head that is fairly dense at first look. The head disappears fairly quickly (unsurprisingly considering the ABV) but does leave a nice collar and some spotty, creamy film on the surface of the body.
The aroma and the taste do have some of the sherry, Madeira and fig/raisin notes that one is looking for in a Quad, BUT the spice is quite strong and it starts to subtract from the richness of the beer/style. There's more acidity than I want in the style, and it takes the beer down a touch in my estimation. Some licorice bitterness that I don't need and more acidity in the aftertaste. Mmmm...lacks the smoothness I want in a Quad. Sorry.
Some creaminess in the body, but again the spice seems to add to the thinner nature of the beer and it is quite harsh. Alcohol is present but at the same time as well hidden as one can expect for 10.00% and for the style. Burns a little but that's not a huge problem for me.
For me this beer lacks the depth and quality of many Quads. I want a REALLY strong sherry note, some intense cream and a lack of edgy acidity. I don't dislike the beer but there are very many Quads that I would choose over it if I was looking to stay within the style. This is acidic, especially for the style and the introduction of some spicy pepper notes takes me away from where I need to be in the style."
Brasserie St. Feuillien,St. Feuillien Saison,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,6.50%,on-tap,3.68,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,8/29/2009,"OK, so I see that this has just made it to Atlanta (and possibly the US) and that it is $7.99 for the 750 mL corked and caged bottle. Pretty good value I thought, but I decided to pass the first couple of time that I see it. Anyway, fast forward a couple of days and Taco Mac on the East West Connector, Austell, GA, USA has it on tap. I order one and ultimately find out it is $9.50 for the small pour! TERRIBLE value. Anyway, back to the beer....
...pour is slightly clouded and is on the orange side of things rather than the paler yellow or golden. Thinnish head but it does linger and leave some wispy lace.
Some funk, a little sweetnesa and a slightly grapefruit based finis make up the beer, and it comes together quite well and nicely for the style. However, it's definitely nothing special and the price for the draft version of this was absolutely, daylight robbery. The bottle at $7.99 would be pretty good value.
In short, drink this at home (or at least not somewhere that's charging $9.50 for a small pour) and you'll get a decent example of style that is refreshing and tasty. If you pay $9.50 for approx. 12 oz then you'll most likely feel ripped-off."
Flying Fish Brewing Company,Imperial Espresso Porter,,,American Porter,8.00%,bottle,3.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,8/29/2009,"12 oz bottle from nerofiddled.
Light brown, cold coffee color with small head and ring of collar left on and around the surface of the beer.
Vapors that gather in the nose are quite surprisingly alcoholic with a touch of malt.
Tastes are quite sweet with some lovely, light coffee notes and general understatement all around. Light warmth is left on the tongue as the alcohol spreads and leaves its mark. Some touches of light, roasted beans in the finish too. Sugary aftertaste.
VERY thin in the mouth, especially considering the style. Definitely the weakest point for the beer.
Actually avery tasty beer that is quite drinkable and the light coffee notes are enjoyable. Mouthfeel is rather light so if you are looking for a ""big"" coffee beer this will not cut it, however I still enjoyed it."
Rogue Brewery (Brewer's on the Bay),Maierfest Lager,,,Märzen / Oktoberfest,5.60%,bottle,4.58,5,4,4.5,5,5,8/29/2009,"WOW and WOW, I wasn't expecting this!
$4.99 for the 22 oz bomber in the usual silk-screened presentation from Green's on Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA.
I usually approach Rogue with some trepidation since I often find their beers over-hopped but this blew me away. (I was worried with the bottle design having hops strewn about Mr. Maier!!)
A significant hiss on opening and a lively pour with a good dose of carbonation. BEAUTIFUL clarity on the golden orange pour with great streaming carbonation - fantastic to look at. Nice white head and some very nice lace.
Plenty of bready malts on the nose with a little organic hay-like alcohol and hoppiness.
Mouthfeel is beautiful too with a touch of prickly carbontion that settles on the tongue to liven the senses. Fine-bubbled, fizzing carbonation gives a great sense of well-being!
Delicious cascading malts and light bitterness come together with a sweet, semi-dry finish that gives great satisfaction and mellow, butterscotch note in the aftertaste. Slightly drier and VERY slightly more hoppy than your average O'fest/Marzen which normally would not sit well with me, but this was fantastic. Mellow aftertaste and moreish character.
DEFINITELY my new favorite Rogue and a really interesting beer. EXTREMELY tasty! Best beer that I have had the pleasure to drink in some time. Delicious."
Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),Samuel Smith's Yorkshire Stingo,,,English Strong Ale,9.00%,bottle,3.9,4,4,4,3,4,8/29/2009,"$10.99 from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA for the 550 mL bottle.
Pour is a suprisingly bright, garnet red color which encourages me. Head is short lived and even knowing about the bottle conditioning, the beer seems rather fizzy by many standards. This detracted from the mouthfeel for me. It was a bit prickly for me.
Plenty of classic maltiness but coupled with vanilla and oak notes. The oak is rather pleasingly sweet as opposed to dry, and in that respect the beer avoids some of the usual pitfalls associated with similar beer. Nice sweetness sits against a mellowed bitterness to form a very rounded picture. I agree with others in terms of a fig presence (slightly surprising) but of course the caramel, biscuit sweetness is just what I would expect for a beer with this malt base - no surprise there.
I enjoyed this a bit more than I thought I would, but at the price point I cannot see myself buying this very often, if ever, again. Good beer but not good value."
Stone Brewing Co.,Juxtaposition Black Pilsner,,,American Double / Imperial Pilsner,10.00%,bottle,1.93,4,3,1.5,2.5,1,8/29/2009,"12 oz bottle as a single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA. Can't remember the exact price but I remember it as being very expensive for what I was getting.
The beer starts off with a great looking black pour that appears totally opaque with little or no colored highlights when held up to the light. Head is small but the film across the top of beer is surprisingly complete. Looks good. Would have been better if I just looked at it rather than tasted it!
The beer exudes a smell that is similar to a double IPA, with a strong hoppy note but with some astringent citrus and roasty licorice aromas. Not my cup of tea but not bad.
The tastes have some citrus (lemon) like notes and some VERY aggressive hops that are unrestrained. There is also a nasty, burned plastic character that to be honest is the adibing memory of this beer. VERY aggressive and dry in the finish. I'm not sure where the pilsner angle comes in, nor am I sure of the point of a ""black"" pilsner, in fact the whole thing is completely lost on me. What starts off as a touch of grapefruit in the taste very quickly becomes a combination of cough syrup, old lemon rind and light pepper. Plastic, plastic, plastic! Hot, messy, over the top alcohol as well.
To me, a beer that is perhaps simply trying to be big for the sake of it, and is just ""showing-off"". This matches what I expect from Brewdog and their take on things, but I was hoping that Stone would resist the temptation to get caught up in this nonsense.
Aftertaste is very dry, astringent and frankly unpleasant. Nasty drainpour, put simply a misguided collaboration/emperor's new clothes type beer, that someone managed to convince themselves was great, and then inlficted upon the general public."
Terrapin Beer Company,Terrapin Reunion Beer 2009,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,?,on-tap,4,4,4,4,4,4,8/29/2009,"On tap at Taco Mac on the East-West Connector, Austell, GA, USA.
Golden yellow pour with a nicely formed thickish head and some very nice lace and retention. Solid mouthfeel (an important feature for the style) and some moreish qualities that make you want to have another sip.
Some simple banana notes with decent alcohol warmth and some spice notes. The beer is not over-stated despite the alcoholic content and it drinks and sits less agressively than one originally may have thought.
Wasn't expecting this style as part of the Reunion series so it was a nice surprise and a nice beer. Enjoyable."
Five Seasons Westside,Big Matt's ESB,,,Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB),5.00%,on-tap,3.98,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,8/28/2009,"On-tap.
Slightly chill-hazed pour with a traditional, light, bubbly head that although not dense, still provides some very nice, sticky lace. Has a cask appearance in terms of the head. Served WAY too cold for my liking, even without the traditional, American frozen glassware! Let it warm a little.
Body is a brownish hue which is not epecially attractive but I guess I'm being a bit hard here. Lacks the classic, deep garnet color that I would really love for the style, but I can live with that.
Nose gives of some of the classic, soft biscuit malt notes and some light caramel. The same things occur in the taste which are in line with the style. So far, so good but the finish is just a little too dry and hoppy for me IF we are talking about an ESB in the classic, English sense. Don't get me wrong, this is NOT a ""hoppy"" beer as such but it does have the American hop influence in the finish which is sort of par for the course in the USA. Despite this it still drinks nicely and with the ""lowish"" ABV I am delighted that the beer is around for me to drink on a regular basis.
Nice job (as usual) by 5SW, but Crawford just needs to let me come and tweak the hops down a notch and the malt up a notch! ;-))"
Clipper City Brewing Co. / Heavy Seas Beer,Heavy Seas - Prosit!,,,Märzen / Oktoberfest,9.00%,bottle,2.43,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,2,8/27/2009,"22 oz bottle from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
I think that the basic idea of ""imperializing"" an Oktoberfest beer is essentially a bad idea since it's simply not a style that needs that kind of treatment, but let's take a closer look.
Pour lacks much life, but that may be a function of the ABV. Golden orange body with a lack of much sustainable head, minimum carbonation and no lace at all. Nice color but overall a touch ordinary to look at.
The nose is not really definitive and offers not much more than alcoholic malt.
The tastes are mainly a metallic, copper coinage bitterness and some alcoholic malts. The sweetness also starts to come through with a lot of sugary elements which then cascade into the finish. More alcohol. This seems ill-defined. Cloying as the bottle is consumed. Lots of sulfur notes.
Essentially a bad idea to start with and it drank in that manner as well. I suggest a crisp, lower ABV, more traditional version of the style and the drinkability will likely be infinitely better and give you a more quintessential version of the style."
Five Seasons Westside,Dark White,,,Witbier,7.50%,on-tap,3.83,3.5,4,4,4.5,3,8/27/2009,"Extremly odd beer for me.
Pour is a turbid brown with very good head, lace and retention. The head was really thick and pleasing almost like the ""scum"" that one gets on top of a fermentation tank. The color is less appealing, but that's just a function of the beer and my persoanl dislike of that muddy brown, Dubbel-like appearance.
Nose and tastes are very bready at first with a yeasty, spice, citrusy note that sits very oddly when you are looking at the beer. It's a case where the tastes tend not to match the appearance - mind games ensue (see Freaktoberfest for somethign similar). Lots more bready notes in the finish and a really chewy beer for me.
It's a fine line when trying to pull off a beer that is a bit odd like this one, and Crawford managed it in as much as I enjoyed it. However, I don't think I'm going to visit this much in the future because it's just a little too ""out ther"" for me."
Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,Zwaanend'ale,,,Bock,8.00%,bottle,4.48,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,8/23/2009,"Thanks go out to BA deepsouth for the trade.
750 mL capped bottle, yellow dot-matrix indicates a 04/14/06 bottling. 3.5 years old, DFH, THIS should be interesting!
Uncapping leads to a hint of gunsmoke and a brief ""pssst"".
Amber, hazed body with a nicely formed tight, white head and some cream like lace. Very solid looking in the glass.
Nose gives off some honey, pineapple and lighter tropical fruits along with a dash of Madeira and some rum-like aromas. There is also a touch of that musty, cellar-like ""old"" smell which often comes with beers of this age. A definite ""earthy"" funky note too, but again this is age related. Alcohol is still present in all its original glory.
Many of the aromas are replicated in the taste, but the strong malt layers of bock presence make themselves very apparent as does a touch of warming alcohol in the finish. More light rum and sherry touches are intermingled with the musty notes.
Surprisingly smooth, and goodness knows why but it reminds me a bit of a nitro-pour! Very smooth, almost like a Boddington's or John Smith's cream flow! GULP!
Anyway, in summary this beer has managed to maintain a fairly large degree of integrity over the three and half years since bottling both in the taste & appearance department and in terms of the style. Of course, without tasting it fresh (which I would have loved to have done) there's no way of knowing how the beer has matured and changed, but it still stands up pretty well which is a testament to the skill of the DFH name."
"Pennichuck Brewing Company, Inc.",The Big O Oktoberfest,,,Märzen / Oktoberfest,6.50%,bottle,2.8,3.5,3.5,2.5,3,2.5,8/23/2009,"22 oz bottle from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA split with my brother-in-law over dinner.
Excellent color on the pour, perhaps a little darker than some in the style, the depth of the mahoghany is quite striking. Head is somewhat disappointing though, fades quickly and not much lace.
Nose reveals some typical malt character with sweetness, but there is a hint of hops too.
Similar situation in the taste with the majority of the body made up from the typical, sweetish, caramel, sugary notes but again there is a bit of a hop bite hanging around and in the finish.
Frankly I could do without the large hop presence in the beer since I feel it is a slight bastardization of the style. The bitterness gathers pace as the bottle is consumed and ends up being a bit of an annoyance.
I've been pretty unimpressed with Pennichuck so far and this really doesn't do much to change that situation for me. One and done here, especially with so many other, better exmples of the style out there at this time of year."
Deschutes Brewery,Buzzsaw Brown,,,American Brown Ale,4.80%,bottle,3,3,3,3,3,3,8/22/2009,"12 oz bottle.
Pour is a standard color of deep amber, but lacks much head or retention. In that respect a touch disappointing.
Nose is also quite mute, with some malts coming through but overall the beer seems rather low-key.
A mouthfeel which is below average for me. It feels on the thin side and definitely lacks much presence or lively carbonation. Feels a bit flat.
Tastes have the standard malt backbone and some degree of light nuttiness but again it seems to lack punch.
For me this is an interesting beer because in the American versions of these beers we usually get much more hop presence. I am basically against that idea in a Brown Ale, in as much as I want them to be at the sweeter end of the spectrum with reserved hops and bigger malts. The problem here is that although the hops are muted (good), the malt and the mouthfeel fail to deliver the necessary body for me. It falls between two stools, and I would think that this would be a bit disappointing to both lovers of the American version of the style, and those that prefer the more traditional Brown Ale.
In the end, disappointing."
New Belgium Brewing,Hoptober Golden Ale,,,American Blonde Ale,6.00%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,8/22/2009,"12 oz bottle from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA as a single.
A lovely, golden body with perfect clarity and some excellent wispy, fine lace. Bone-white colored head. Carbonation is medium. Good color, and the fact that the name includes the word ""Golden"" seems appropriate.
Nose and tastes reveal a very subtle, but potent hop profile. This is VERY reminiscent of a wet-hopped beer. I don't know if it is ACTUALLY wet-hopped but it certainly smells and drinks that way. Decent malt backbone holds it all together and although the hop profile is strong, it is also light and delicate at the same time.
Not my favorite type of beer, but New Belgium seems to have crafted a nice beer here. Should appeal to the hop loving crowd, but the delicate nature also finds a place on my palate too. Nice beer to dovetail with the upcoming, cooler season. Crisp and dry in the finish it works well. Tailgating anyone?
Impressive and simple, this beer is one that I was surprised by and enjoyed very much. I'm a touch confused by the American Blonde categorization but that's trivial, it's still a good beer."
21st Amendment Brewery,Hell Or High Watermelon Wheat Beer,,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,4.90%,can,3.53,3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,8/19/2009,"12 oz can.
Poured into the Tucher Weizen 500 mL glass, the beer produces a light straw-like color, clouded appearance and a lack of much head at all. Lace is pretty much non-existent.
Nose reveals something fruity, although frankly it is difficult for me to distinguish much in terms of watermelon.
The tastes add more fruit, and although it is stronger than the nose it still seems more like pineapple or pear to me than watermelon. Definite ""estery"" angle no matter which way you look at it. Smooth in the mouth. the beer is quite sweet, and I would imagine that many will find it too much so. I on the other hand, enjoyed it very much since I have a sweet tooth.
I was interested to try this beer since, as we know, real watermelon does not have a very strong ""taste"" at all, however the traditional, Jolly Rancher, artificial watermelon taste that has become the popular and accepted taste was missing here - I'm glad it was. This beer was a long way from that artificial concoction.
It does a decent job as a wheat based refresher in summer months, but for me that's about its limit. Use it as a Hefe replacement and you'll probably be quite happy."
Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,Squall IPA,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,9.00%,bottle,3.55,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,8/16/2009,"Thanks go out to mikey711 for the chance to try this one.
750 mL bottle, capped and bottled on 04/16/09 according to the yellow, dot-matrix style stamp on the neck.
Impressive looking pour with a very high, bone-white, two finger head sitting atop a golden-orange, clear body. Head retention is super and the lace substantial and sticky.
Nose is a combo of some resinous hops with some sinus clearing, sweet alcohol.
Like the regular 90 min, this is a pretty sweet beer. To be honest it treads a very fine line between that cloying sweetness, hot alcohol and palate stripping hop presence. From one mouthful to the next, the beer works and then doesn't work in almost equal measure. When one makes a beer like this that is an occupational hazard and although understandable and an almost inevitable consequence of a beer of this nature, it does not help the long term drinkability. I enjoyed this - JUST! You HAVE to be in the mood for it. I get the feeling that if I were to visit this on 10 different occasions, half of the time I would not care for it much.
This reminds me a little of 120 min from years ago which may be a trick of the mind which in turn is being enhanced by the 750 mL presentation.
Interesting as usual from DFH."
Nethergate Brewery Co. Ltd.,Nethergate Old Growler,,,English Porter,5.50%,bottle,4.43,4,5,4.5,4,4,8/16/2009,"500 mL bottle. I have a feeling that this came from Green's in Columbia, SC, USA.
Excellent black colored pour with super red highlights and wonderful lace. Head is a mocha colored film that sits on the surface of the beer. 
Nose has a really obvious malty, licorice note that is very strong fro the style and the ABV. Surprisingly potent.
Tastes are quintessential for the style. VERY, very light smoke, plenty of malts and a sweet undertone. The beer is very dry especially in the finish. Surprisingly so. It actually leaves a small coating on the teeth.
This beer has a Black Country mild feel about it and it reminds me a one particularly desperate summer when I found myself in Keele, Stoke-on -Trent and Newcastle-Under-Lyme. 
Extremely drinkable and delicious. Good stuff."
Ska Brewing Co.,Nefarious Ten Pin Imperial Porter,,,Baltic Porter,8.00%,bottle,3.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,8/16/2009,"22 oz presentation with the attractive blue wax. Looks promising.
Pour is a lovely, black body with some brownish highlights. The head is rocky, mocha in color and high. It looks great, but to be honest it fades a bit quickly and loses depth leaving not much lace.
This is a really interesting beer to me for a number of reasons. Firstly I really enjoy SKA. Secondly the head fading so quickly is a bit of a disappointment.
Normally, beers of this style, with this ABV tend to be pretty boozy and substantial in the mouth (take Smuttynose Baltic Porter as an example), so I am really quite surprised that this beers lacks a really big alcohol presence and the beer is really relatively thin. It's true that the alcohol seems to build toward the end of the bottle, but at the same time t seems really manageable and fairly simple.
Not especially complex, but that's both good and bad. It adds to the drinkability somewhat, but it is a little unusual for the style. In that respect a very light drinking beer if you consider the style.
The Smuttynose and this one certainly make a very interesting comparison."
Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),LongShot Traditional Bock,,,Bock,6.80%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,8/15/2009,"In a nutshell, a very solid beer, to style and drinks well.
12 oz pour from the Longshot 6 pack.
Lovely amber, mahogany body with a nicely formed, dense head that looks substantial. The beer has a malt based, sweet nose with a touch of alcohol. Good lace and retention.
The alcohol comes through in the taste and it drinks every bit of the advertised 6.80%. Lots of malty depth, coating the mouth nicely and producing a satisfying experience. A touch of nuttiness in the finish as well.
Alll in a ll a very nice beer that drinks very nicely to style for me."
Fordham Brewing Company,Fordham New World Wheat,,,Hefeweizen,?,bottle,2.6,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,8/15/2009,"12 oz bottle as a single form Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.



Added as a new entry to the BA db but surprised that it is not in already. I know there can be confusion with locations, brewpubs etc., but this is labeled as being brewed by Fordham in Dover, DE so I have added it there.



Pour is a cloudy yellow as one would expect, but the necessary, high, rocky, well retained head that should produce great lace is missing - a shame.



Nose revelas the standard clove, spice and a touch of artificial, mashed banana.



The tastes skirt around the place they need to be without ever really diving fully in to the mix. A little insipid which is not helped by the thin mouthfeel and the somewhat dulled tones.



Seems like a slightly below average Hefe to me, and perhaps a beer that was brewed to appeal to the masses rather than hit the style on the head. I dunno, rather disappointing to say the least."
Full Sail Brewery & Tasting Room & Pub,LTD Series - 03,,,German Pilsener,5.60%,bottle,3.85,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,8/15/2009,"12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pale blue label this time on the usual, Ltd Series presentation.
Pour is a crystal clear, mid-yellow with nice lace and retention. A good sign in a Pils and a pre-requisite for a good lager experience.
Nose is light with little to report other than a touch of bitterness. That's OK, at least it's clean.
Tastes are importantly crisp, dry and refreshing. As it should be, i.e. simple and straightforward.
No off-flavors and although the beer lacks a huge Saaz like bite in the finish that I often look for in my Pils, it still satisfies, goes down easy and s very drinkable. Refreshing and tasty, a nice beer to introduce some craft to the macro crowd. Good example of the style, worth picking up if you are looking for something of this ilk."
Left Hand Brewing Company,St. Vrain Tripel,,,Tripel,9.00%,bottle,2.9,3,3,3,3,2.5,8/14/2009,"22 oz bottle from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour is a wheat, colored, light yellow hazed body. Head is disappointingly thin and lacks presence. Unfortunately this is a feature of the beer - a lack of depth and presence.
Lots of banana notes more than anything else. In fact, this almost seems like a banana, alcoholic cocktail! It certainly skates around the Tripel style, but to me it really feels quite thin. Alcohol is resent, but that's OK becuase the style demands it, and to be honest given the 9.00% it seems quite manageable. There are some serious yeast notes in there as it should be, but this beer is really weak for me.
Thin in the mouth, the beer is ultimately disappointing to me. Not easy to drink considering the style is one of my favorites. One and done for me here. Sorry, but I just don't like it much."
Einbecker Brauhaus AG,Einbecker Mai-Ur-Bock,,,Maibock / Helles Bock,6.50%,bottle,4.45,4.5,4,4.5,4,5,8/11/2009,"Exceptional beer. On-tap at The Brick Store, Decatur, GA, USA and many times from the bottle.
I like the presentation, especially the glassware - classy and very German. Green color is attractive. Pour is a golden amber body which surprises me a little. Perfect carbonation leading to a fantastic head that lingers and produces some special lace.
Nose and tastes immediately raise the caramel stakes. Lots of light, sugary notes but these give way to the ethanol fairly quickly. The finish is a bit boozy that suggests an ABV higher than the 6.50%. A lot of malt presence (obviously), but the finish belies the style a little and puts in a shot or two of typically harsh, German hops. Super beer that is one of my favorites."
Birrificio Le Baladin,Wayan,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,5.80%,bottle,3.65,3.5,4,3.5,3,4,8/9/2009,"$13.95 for the very attractive, 750 mL presentation from Vintage Cellar, Blacksburg, VA, USA. Blue foil and strange kind of cap completes the picture.
Many Italian beers have been a crap shot for me, and the combination of varying quality and somewhat expensive prices have led me to be a touch wary. From time to time I'll break down and get one, and this is one of those times.
Pour is initially extremely carbonated but this fades fast. A thin ring around the beer and some surface froth leaves very little lace. The body is a simple golden color with some cloudiness and quite a lot of gray sediment.
Nose and tastes are very herbal (as expected). Many of these Italian beers have a distinct herbal nature, and I am wondering if this is a feature of the yeast strains. The herbs are quite nice and they build across the whole bottle to give an almost, mild burning chili feel toward the end of the beer. There is some light paper in there as well.
Not a traditional farmhouse or saison by any stretch of the imagination, but a beer that is intriguing. Not especially complex either, but tasty nonetheless. The one place this brew falls down a little is the mouthfeel. It really feels a touch thin to me, and that's one of the abiding memories (unfortunately). Lowish ABV (relatively speaking) is a plus for me.
Pricey to be honest, but glad I tried it."
River Company Restaurant & Brewery,River Company Stout,,,American Stout,4.50%,on-tap,3.53,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,8/9/2009,"Very solid example of the style.



Simple, black pour with a fine head and lace. Not much to report other than solid.



Decent roasted notes with a finish that was dryish but still left me wanting more.



Not the best of the beers at The River Company but quite acceptable in terms of quality and the style.



Tasty and drinkable, with a solid look."
River Company Restaurant & Brewery,Southwest V IPA,,,American IPA,4.80%,on-tap,3.93,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,8/9/2009,"Simple and good quality example of the style.



The most abiding memory of this beer was the lace. Very fine, but also sticky and very abundant. Light orange tones with a fruity nose that belies its American roots. 



Slightly reminded me of an English version with a light touch on the alcohol and the hops.



A gentle and subtle beer that would have some serious potential for crossover.



Good summer drinking and nice beer to introduce the beer ignorant to. Approachable."
River Company Restaurant & Brewery,Farmhouse Hefe,,,Hefeweizen,?,on-tap,4.25,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,8/9/2009,"Interesting beer and Mike the Brewmaster was VERY enthusiastic about it.
It has its roots in a Colombian recipe that turn turn has its roots in a genuine German one. A complicated story how it came to be in this part of the world, but nevertheless an interesting one.
Standard look, with good lace and retention.
The strongest part of the beer was the nose which was POTENT! One of the stronest clove notes I have witnessed in some time. Rounded out with a touch more spice and some light banana.
Very true to style, I could see how many German's would be impressed by this beer. Arguably the best of the bunch on my visit and a beer that Mike is truly (and rightly) proud of.
Tasty, drinkable and a very good example of the stlyle."
River Company Restaurant & Brewery,Traveler's Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),5.00%,on-tap,3.68,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,8/9/2009,"Straight-up simple version of the style with a hop bill that is obvious but at the same time reserved.
Good malt balance, refreshing and drinkable. Light orange body with minimal lace, the beer drinks easier than most of the style.
Tasty and worth a visit. Probably a beer that could easily be put into a simple, everyday rotation. Less aggressive than some of the same ilk."
"Anheuser-Busch, Inc.",O'Doul's,,,Low Alcohol Beer,0.50%,bottle,1.25,3,1.5,1,1.5,1,8/8/2009,"12 oz single from Arbor Place Beverage, Douglasville, GA, USA.
Style 103/103 reviewed on BA.
Pour yields a highly carbonated body and some decent head. Unfortunately the head is gone within 90 seconds as the large bubbles disappear and there is virtually no lace. Carbonation seems very high. Body is a typical macro, yellow piss color, no better or worse than scores of other macro's.
Nose is a little strong. VERY strong vegetal notes, smells like dirty water.
The taste is an artifically, plastic-like affair with a surprising lack of bitterness. Many non-alcoholic beers I have had in the past have had a strong bitterness - this doesn't. If it were not for the smell that one gets when the glass goes up to the mouth, one would think that this were simply carbonated water. The mouthfeel is woefully thin and the taste is that of water that has been siting in a plastic bottle, in a warm car for a couple of days. Aftertaste is slightly malty.
Let's face it, you can't make worthy beer with little or zero alcohol."
Deschutes Brewery,Black Butte Porter,,,American Porter,5.20%,bottle,3.95,4,4,4,3.5,4,8/8/2009,"12 oz bottle. Best before 06/11/09.
Pour is a slightly ruddy, black pour with some brownish red highlights at the extremities. The head is frothy and dense but is surprisingly short lived. Some light lace, but not as good as I was hoping.
Nose gives plenty of sweet chocolate malts. Quite chocolate-like and in that respect rather unusual.
Slight acidity in the taste. Perhaps not as creamy as I was expecting, but also perhaps not quite as hoppy as I was expecting for and American version of this old, English style. Interesting and a little surprising.
Finish comes with a slight smoke element and an additional metallic charcoal note - it's subtle, but it's there.
Drinkability is good, and to be honest not as aggressive as many American Porters and in that respect I prefer it. I generally prefer a creamy, less aggressive, malty rather than hoppy Porter and this fits the bill."
Greene King / Morland Brewery,Ruddles County,,,English Bitter,4.70%,bottle,4.95,5,5,5,4.5,5,8/8/2009,"500 mL bottle from Peace Street Market, Raleigh, NC, USA. $4.99.
I've been drinking Ruddles County (and Ruddles Best with the blue logo) for about 25 years, but not so much in the last ten since I've been marooned in the USA. My past experience has largely been on draft and in cans, but this is one of the clear glass, imported bottles.
Pour is resplendent. It gives a beautiful, light copper body and a fantastic, frothy, large bubbled, sustained head and great sticky lace.
HUGE, light biscuity malts and delicate hops fill the nostrils even before the pour. Cracking the cap gives a whiff and then the pour releases the full force.
Tastes are a gentle assault. Wave after wave of light biscuit malts, simple hop bitterness and smooth sweet ending. The aftertaste lingers forever! 
There's a whole bunch of things that I want to say about this beer. It reminds me of some of my earliest drinking days as a teenager between the ages of about 15 and 19 (and beyond). At the time, the beer seemed impossibly hoppy, and to be honest, in the context of English Beers of this ilk it really is quite dry and bitter, but of course in the light of contemporary American brewing it seems somewhat tame. Of course, that tame nature is really classy and subtle in a manner that the higher hopped and higher ABV American beers could NEVER begin to understand, but that's a different story.
There's also a degree of nostalgia attached to this beer (in fact a HUGE amount), but even considering that I am conscious of this, it's still a STUNNING beer to me. it reminds me of my Dad. 
Finally many will argue that Greene King has corrupted this beer over time, and to be honest I think that there is some truth to that, but even 25 years after I first drank it the beer brings a tear to my eye for more than one reason.
God Bless this beer."
River Company Restaurant & Brewery,Fairlawn's Finest Cream Lager,,,Cream Ale,4.50%,on-tap,4,4,4,4,4,4,8/8/2009,"On tap at the brewery with Mike (the Brewmaster) in attendance!



First off I made an assumption about this beer that is often correct but in this case was a little off. The production of a beer like this in a brewpub is usually done mainly to satisfy the hoards of BMC drinkers that can only stomach a light beer of some description. When I asked Mike about this he told me that yes, there was *some* truth in that, BUT he would only be content brewing a beer that additionally stood on its own, and secondly would also appeal (in style) to BA's like me. Well, he did it! In retrospect, of the five beers that i tasted on my visit, this wasarguably my favorite - never something that I would have predicted in advance of my visit.



Pour gave a light colored body but the hue was darker than a typical light beer. Slightly more viscous in the mouth, the Cream Ale elements came through very strongly in the nose and across the palate.



Easy drinking with a richness that ne does not normally associate with the style or such a relatively delicate beer. Finish was rounded nicely and gave way to a touch of sweetness.



A super beer, and a delight to behold. It's great to hear the philosophy behind the beer too, and Mike has done a really nice job with this one. Tasty."
Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,Sierra Nevada Kellerweis Hefeweizen,,,Hefeweizen,4.80%,bottle,3.43,4,4,3.5,2.5,3,8/8/2009,"12 oz stubbie (usual SN presentation) poured aggressively into the Tucher, 0.5 L Weizen glass - nice pairing.
Looks good and as it should. High, rocky, white head and a light, lemon colored body with the appropriate clouded appearance. Unusually though, very little yeasty sediment came out in the last 20% swirl.
Nose lays on the banana side of things rather than the clove. Spices are low-key for the style.
Light banana is replicated in the tastes with a touch more spice being evident compared to what was suggested by the nose. Simple, but true to style.
Mouthefeel is where this beer seems to fade some. It feels a little too watery for me and frankly I end end being a bit disappointed. Lacks depth. Lowish ABV helps me to like this more.
Nice looker, nice nose and some tastes that work, but this beer ultimately fails to deliver in terms of mouthfeel and satisfaction."
Brouwerij De Troch,Chapeau Banana Lambic,,,Lambic - Fruit,3.50%,bottle,1.88,1.5,2,2,2,1.5,8/7/2009,"12 oz, mini champagne, corked and capped affair from Camp Creek Beverage, Atlanta, GA, USA. Dimpled bottom.
Pour is a nasty looking, malt liquor colored, golden hue with minimal head and a LOT of dark golden floaties. Unattractive.
Nose gives off an artificial sweetness, detectable as ""fruity"" but not especially banana based. The taste reflects this mystery fruit, although it is more banana-like than the nose. Musty, cardboard enters the equation as well.
Cloyingly sweet and not much else. Odd that since the beer is so nastily sweet, it still manages to feel thin?! It's also cloying, which seems to be an oxymoron when coupled with thin. I dunno, either way it's horribly disappointing and difficult to drink.
Possible old bottle, BUT with no dates supplied I'll never know and I feel totally justified in reviewing it."
Bull & Bones Brewhaus & Grill,Razz-Ma-Tazz Raspberry Hefeweizen,,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,5.00%,on-tap,2.8,3.5,3,2.5,3,3,8/7/2009,"On Tap.



Seasonal special with 17(?!) IBU's and 5.0% ABV as advertised on the blackboard behind the bar.



Murky, pink appearance with a good head and excellent lace.



Drinks almost exclusively like a fruit beer so I categorized it NOT as a Hefe, rather as a fruit infused beer. The raspberry flavor predominates but there is the mouthfeel and character of a wheat beer in there too.



Nose and tastes have some decent raspberry notes and the beer is sweet and drinkable in one sense, but after one I'd had quite enough. One for the ladies that like sweeter brews and not your average BA, I suspect."
Flying Fish Brewing Company,HopFish,,,English India Pale Ale (IPA),6.30%,bottle,4.33,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,8/7/2009,"12 oz single thanks to nerofiddled for the chance to try this one.
Great clarity on the copper colored body and some bone-white lace with better than average retention and lace.
A nice combo on the nose of some fruit and well balanced sweet malts and hops.
Malty and biscuity, the hops are subtle in this beer and for intents and purposes this is an English IPA. It lacks the harsh, upfront aggression that the American version of the style often has, and in that respect some will probably be disappointed. A fruity note balances some hop bitterness very well. Take it down a couple of ABV points and we have really nice English version. Aftertaste is moreish and has some more sweetness.
Simple, attractive, drinkable and quite subtle. Unusual in all respects in an American style but very enjoyable. I could have even mistaken this for an ESB."
Southern Tier Brewing Company,ÜberSun (Imperial Summer Wheat Beer),,,American Pale Wheat Ale,8.00%,bottle,3.93,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,8/7/2009,"22 oz bottle, $6.99 from Green's, Greenville, SC, USA.
Pour is a bright, golden-orange body that sits underneath a rocky head with great retention.
Nose gives quite a lot of syrupy, sugar alcohol and a touch of the hops.
Tastes are quite a subtle combination of Saaz like bitterness and alcohol which has a slight warming effect. The aftertaste emphasizes both quite well. 
Smooth in the mouth with no hint of the cloying nature that I was anticipating given the style and the alcohol. Ice cold this beer is feverishly easy to drink but as it warms it comes into an area that I think it is supposed to sit in. It does have a high alcohol presence and quite a noticeable degree of hop bitterness, especially in the finish. For those reasons I would say that at least in terms of the way it drinks (and ignoring formal style descriptions), this beer is basically an Imperial Pils. In fact, I was trying to place where I thought I had tasted this combo before and it was easy to remember - Rogue Imperial Pils and Sam Adams Imperial Pils.
In summary, it's an Imperial Pilsner and in that respect I am very curious as to how this compares to Krampus."
Terrapin Beer Company,Terrapin Maggie's Farmhouse Ale,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,6.00%,bottle,3.73,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,8/2/2009,"22 oz bottle from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA. The usual presentation for the Side Project Series.
Pour is a hazy, orange/yellow that seems closer to a Wit rather than a Saison.
Nose has light clove and bananas, again, replicating a Wit rather than the Saison style.
Tastes are a sweet and sour combo with some lemon notes and some ""bitterish"" orange peel. As others have noted, there is a bitterness about the beer that one might associate with the rye. It has a dry, slightly hoppy note that I would not normal associate with the style, and it's almost as if the beer has half a toe in the Belgian IPA style. There's a very light touch of funkiness there too but it's very light for the style, and even a mild alcohol burn in the chest afterwards.
I'd call this pretty complex, and I would not call it necessarily a typical Saison, in fact for me it's closer to a cross between a Wit and a Belgian IPA. Very interesting. Complicated beer that walks a fine line between bad and good. Tricky beer this one, and by far the most interesting and complicated in the SP series so far.
Not my favorite beer, but definitely a brew that is worth taking a long hard look at. Even though I'm not in love with it, I would certainly recommend trying it."
Brouwerij De Troch,Chapeau Kriek Lambic,,,Lambic - Fruit,3.50%,bottle,3.75,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,8/1/2009,"OK, interesting. Bought this one with four others from Camp Creek Beverage back in March of this year. At the time I knew that they had been around for quite a while, so I expect that these a quite old, BUT with no freshness dating of any description on the beer it simply isn't possible to know. If brewers don't put dates then I think it's entirely legitimate to review their beers.
12 oz mini-champagne, capped and corked. The cork is tight but it does not leave the bottle with much pop.
Body has a really obvious, plum colored, purple hue. Really attractive color, but the head is largely non-existent. A few bubbles but it's not really dense and it seems forced as if a person has blown bubbles into the beer with a straw.
Nose has a pungent cherry, candy notes. The beer is pretty sweet but it's not too much for me. Others may take another position. In the back end there is a touch of musty, old character. Is this an old bottle? We'll never know. Light acidity in the back too, but obviously no funk.
OK, it is what it is. This is a sweetened lambic NOT a sour/funk, but I like it. I would like to have this very fresh as I suspect I would score it even higher.
LOVE the ABV, and to be honest if you take it for what it is I think it's pretty good."
Moylan's Brewery,Kilt Lifter Scotch Ale,,,Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy,8.00%,bottle,3.53,3,4,3.5,3,3.5,7/31/2009,"12 oz bottle, Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA. $2.49 for the single.
Pour is a rich garnet body which looks good, but the head and lace are just woefully disappointing considering the style. I want a rich, dense head and (at least in part) because of the ABV and the way the alcohol is constructed in this beer I am disappointed. Lower the ABV and get a better beer is what I say.
Anyway, nose has alcohol and quite a bit of sherry amongst the malt base. As expected and nice.
Tastes reflect the nose and lay o the sweet side of things which sits well with me. A touch of alcohol burn in the finish that I can do without. Mouthfeel lacks density and is a little light for the style and for what I am looking for. The alcohol presence seems to cause the mouthfeel to thin out even more. Lots of sugars present
I dunno, for one of my favorite styles, and a brewer that I like, the alcohol here seems to intrude upon the brew in a way that's not good. There's a certain lack of balance that seems to manifest itself in more than one area and spoils the beer a little for me."
Ballast Point Brewing Company,Calico Copper Amber Ale,,,American Amber / Red Ale,5.00%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,7/30/2009,"12 oz single, $1.99 from CBX, Charleston, SC, USA.
Pour is a deep red with slightly off-white head that leaves some nice, sticky lace. The lace is an important feature of this style for me. Good clarity on the pour.
Nose and tastes show plenty of malty sweetness, but being faithful to the American version of this style there is also plenty of hop character to balance it out. It finishes dry (which is what I want the style to do), and it leaves me with some nice, hoppy burps. Caramel and toffee notes against the malt background, some (light if that's possible) molasses as well.
To be honest this drinks much bigger than either the style or the ABV would suggest, and in some ways it reminds me a little of a much bigger (in all respects), American Strong Ale.
Drinkable and punches a touch above its weight. Solid beer from a solid brewer."
Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),Brewer Patriot Collection - Traditional Ginger Honey Ale,,,Herbed / Spiced Beer,5.50%,bottle,3.55,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,7/30/2009,"12 oz bottle.
Absolutely delighted to get a chance to try this after my own bottle fell out of the DBF and smashed on to the floor at the tome the patriot four-pack was original released. Didn't think I would ever see this again, but thanks to a recent trader, I got this bottle. Best Before October 2006 - err....almost three years late; never mind.
Pour is a bright, tangerine body with a healthy head and some sediment. Head fades to a thin film on the surface of the beer. It looks as though it has held up quite well over the years. 
Nose and tastes have some yeasty, Saison like breadiness. The tastes reflect that and then in the end you get the hint of ginger. It lingers a bit in the aftertaste and it's a nice change. Tasty brew even after all of this time. Some honey smooths out the finish as well.
I didn't have this fresh so I have no idea how this compares to those bottles that were cosumed at the time it original came out, but for me it's a nice brew even now."
Brasserie Fantôme,Fantôme Chocolat,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,8.00%,bottle,3.78,5,4,3.5,3.5,4,7/30/2009,"750 mL, capped and caged bottle. Green's, Ponce de Leon, Atlanta, GA, USA. Slight gusher on opening but nothing too great.
Fantome is usually pretty interesting and I don't suppose that Chocolat is likely to be any less! 
Bizarre color on the pour, it looks like liquid Butterscotch, with a murky thin body (that's why I gave it a ""5"", not because it was particularly ""good"", but because it was ""exceptional""). The initially vigorous head does fade but leaves a thin film of foam on the surface of the beer and some collar and a little lace.
Nose gives away the usual farmhouse, Fantome funk with perhaps an extra note of acidity (or is that simply a powdery, bakers chocolate that I get?)
Quite gassy without being highly carbonated, there is some prickle in the body.
With eyes open, the chocolate element is obvious (color), but with eyes closed it seems rather like just another Fantome with one tiny exception; a little, tiny heat in the finish and aftertaste from the chilli. Drinakbility increases down the bottle for me with greater and greater organic elements seemingly coming through. Still not much chocolate though, and that's just fine - I wasn't expecting a ""chocolate"" beer from the Soy crowd!
Interesting and as drinkable as many Fantome's, but ultimately a bit of a novelty for me."
Pabst Brewing Company,McSorley's Irish Pale Ale,,,Irish Red Ale,5.50%,bottle,3.15,3,3,3,3.5,3.5,7/30/2009,"12 oz single from Total Wine, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour is a darkish amber (copper) which slightly contradicts the ""Pale Ale"" moniker on the label. Head forms quickly, but disappers quickly too. Minimal lace.
Nose and tastes are surprisingly sweet, and with the color of the beer I begin to wonder what kind of grain bill we have in this beer. Bready sugar too. This doesn't do well as an Irish Red, and it's not really got much Pale Ale character at all. My bet is that the words ""Pale Ale"" have been slapped on the package purely for marketing purposes. Falls between a number of stlyes and misses several of them by a wide margin.
Very middle of the road for me. Not bad, not good but my suspicion is that more effort went into the marketing of this beer than the making of it. Shame, but it's likely to be one and done for me. Non-offensive is the best I can come up with."
Pabst Brewing Company,McSorley's Irish Black Lager,,,Euro Dark Lager,5.50%,bottle,3.03,3.5,3,3,3,3,7/30/2009,"12 oz single, Total Wine, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Much like its brother, this beer owes more to the marketers than it does the brewers. I liked this about the same as the ""Pale"" Ale, but again it seemed very mediocre and a beer that is searching for a style home.
Pour gives a balck body with some dull, red highlights. Head is short-live, lace is minimal.
Nose gives away some sweet malts and a touch of roastiness but to be honest it's pretty light. Bidy seems a touch on the light side too. A touch of bitterness in the finish but it all seems a little half-arsed to me. Hastily put together by the MBA's raher than the brewmaster.
The marketing angle is encapsulated by the McSorley's guf on the rear label rather than much about the beer."
Rinkuškiu Alaus Darykla,Žaibo,,,Euro Strong Lager,9.50%,bottle,1.45,1.5,1.5,1.5,2,1,7/30/2009,"500 mL bottle.
Pretty much as expected.
Pour is a slightly viscous, dark golden orange body. Head and lace are 100% missing.
Nose gives a strong alcoholic whiff and a nasty solvent aroma.
Taste is all alcohol and incredibly sweet and cloying. I suspect that the role of this beer in Eastern Europe was/is as strictly an alcohol delivery vehicle, and this is all it is. In that respect it's a great success. In every other possible way it's an complete failure.
Mild afterburn in the chest and a horrible, solvent like finish complete the picture.
Nasty. Drainpour. Period."
Atwater Block Brewery,Atwater Voodoovator,,,Doppelbock,9.50%,bottle,3.63,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,7/29/2009,"12 oz bottle from a recent Bruisin' Ales transaction - thanks guys! One of my favorite styles from a brewer that I know very little about (are these the guys with the exploding bottles??)
Poured into the Ommegang chalice we get a nice, rich, dark brown body and some very nice creamy head and lace. The body has a certain density about it which is, of course, requisite for the style. It has a presence which is good.
Nose delivers unmistakable sweet malts and a hint of alcohol.
Tastes are pretty much in line with the style although it is not quite as sweet as I was anticipating and the alcohol is certainly well hidden. A dryish finish (for the style) and a hint of smoke perhaps? Obviously very malt based as it should be. The finish also imparts a touch of licorice amongst the dry character. Some slightly burned caramel and sugar.
Tasty, with alcohol well disguised but seems to have a drying nature that I do not normally associate with the style."
Tyranena Brewing Company,Paradise By The Dashboard Light Doubly Blessed Cherry Porter,,,American Porter,7.50%,bottle,4.38,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,7/29/2009,"12 oz stubbie as pictured.
Poured into the Terrapin snifter, the beer is perhaps not as viscous as I was expecting. Head is a light mocha color but very fine and light.
Nose has dry, baking chocolate (or cocoa/Cadbury's drinking chocolate) with some light fruit infused. The fruit seems like a cross between cherry and raspberry, but to be honest it is more on the raspberry side of things to my nose.
Tastes are light but at the same time have some decent presence. There are plenty of slightly bitter chocolate notes with a gentle fruity acidity alongside it. The aftertaste and finish linger very gently with touch more bitterness and some subtle, light cherry juice.
The body is light as well which helps add to the drinkability and puts it into the ""high"" category. ABV nowhere to be seen.
Actually, counter to my initial thoughts, this was a really subtle, light beer and was very drinkable and approachable. Tasty too."
Zywiec Breweries PLC (Heineken),Zywiec Beer,,,Euro Pale Lager,5.70%,bottle,3.4,3.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,4,7/28/2009,"$2.49 for the 500 mL bottle from a Russian supermarket out in Decatur, GA, USA.
Sometimes you just get a moment when a beer is simply perfect for the circumstance. Zywiec happened to fill one of those moments for me yesterday.
Very little to report about the beer itself other than what you would expect. The pour gives a golden body with a bone-white head. Head is good but lace and retention are not great. The nose is essentially neutral which is not necessarily a bad thing, but at the same time is probably the weakest part of the brew.
Light hop presence and a nice sweetness to back it up. Very drinkable, smooth and lacks funk or bitter aftertaste.
It's a very simple beer and that's the beauty of it. It allows a refreshing, non-threatening taste that seems much smoother than I was anticipating."
Cervejaria Sudbrack Ltda,Eisenbahn Rauchbier,,,Rauchbier,6.30%,bottle,3.03,3.5,3,3,3,3,7/25/2009,"12 oz, $1.99 single from Green's, Atlanta, GA, USA. This is the Defumada, blue labeled, ""Smoked Lager"" presentation.
Pour is quite frankly a beautifully colored, deep mahoghany color. The head, lace and retention are not good, but the color is very attractive.
Nose surprisingly does not reveal any smoke. It just gives a light alcohol and some really dense, malty sweetness.
The taste gives away the first hint of smoke. It's very subtle and to be honest the beer drinks more like a Doppelbock with a touch of smoke in the background. This ain't no Schlenkerla. The smoke lingers a touch in the aftertaste but it's pretty muted.
As a smoke beer this is going to be a disappointment, but as a sweet, malty Doppelbock style, it's OK - make up your own mind."
Sixpoint,Sixpoint Express,,,Quadrupel (Quad),11.30%,growler,3.18,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,7/25/2009,"22 oz bomber courtesy of Grant via Bierkraft. Must have been filled from a tap, so I guess this could be classified as a growler fill.
The appearance is unusual for a Quad. It is very orange. Clouded body and a decent amount of head, lace and retention considering the ABV. A little light for a Quad.
Nose and tastes are extremly fruity. Alcohol is conspicuous by it's relative absence in both the nose and tastes considering the whopping 11.3. The fruit is not easy to place, but it's definitely a bubble-gum based thing. The alcohol comes through a touch in the finish, but to be honest it's not at all overpowering. Sweetness begins to grind a touch after half of the first glass. 
Very powerful beer in terms of the ABV and of course this is really a double-edged sword.
Not really my cup of tea and at 11.3 it simply becomes a beer that requires just too much planning and effort for me, without the pay-off of being a great brew."
Tröegs Brewing Company,Scratch Beer 14 - 2008,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,6.70%,bottle,3.95,4,4,4,3.5,4,7/25/2009,"12 oz single bottle.
Bright yellow body, fine sediment and creamy head and lace. Clouded. Pretty good representation of the style in terms of looks.
Light clove in the nose with a touch of overripe banana. 
Taste replicates the nose but give a bit more alcohol. Prickly carbonation seems a bit above average for the style but still maintains its creamy nature. Finish is noticeably dry, somewhat unique and enjoyable. It adds to the overall experience. Has what I would call some ""French, vinous character with Saison overtures"". Tasty.
Some spicy yeasty adds to the flavor.
Nice brew."
Tröegs Brewing Company,Scratch Beer 10 - 2008,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,11.00%,bottle,1.73,2,2,1.5,2.5,1.5,7/25/2009,"12 oz bottle as a single.
Pour is very dark for a Belgian Pale of any description. Has a copper hue with (obviously) limited lace, head and retention. Film forms on the surface white a white collar. 
Nose has some serious sherry and liquor notes alongside the alcohol. It seems quite aggressive.
Tastes come on strong with loads of alcohol. It's hot and unbalanced. Drinks a little Quad-like and has plenty of solvent like character. Thin in the mouth which adds to the obvious alcohol. Some organic (chemistry) aromas with some more solvent esters to the fore.
Rough and edgy. Seems a little too much like Moonshine or everclear to me. Hot and fairly unapproachable. Good decision not to brew this by Troegs! Not good."
Tröegs Brewing Company,Scratch Beer 16 - 2008,,,Winter Warmer,6.30%,bottle,2.18,3.5,2.5,2,3,1.5,7/25/2009,"12 oz single bottle.
Winter Warmer??? I thought it was more like an American IPA. 
Dark, mahogany pour with good clarity in the body. Head is small and clears quickly to give a thin, off-white collar and some film on the surface of the beer.
Nose gives away a little alcohol and some more solvent like character. Not much else.
Tastes are bitter rather than spiced. Very American IPA like in terms of aggressive hops. This is tempered by some malt but the whole combo is not very good. It has a dry finish. Lacks a typical combo of spices and sweetness and the beer is a bit of a peppery, bitter mess.
Unbalanced, difficult to drink and not enjoyable. Bitter and dry which are both out of place."
Tröegs Brewing Company,Scratch Beer 15 - 2008,,,Oatmeal Stout,6.00%,bottle,1.95,2.5,2.5,1.5,2.5,2,7/25/2009,"12 oz single.
Some of these Scratch brews seem to be stylistically challenged which may be a function of the BA database or perhaps a function of the beer. Either way it could lead to some confusion and disappointment.
This appears to be a coffee infused stout as opposed to an oatmeal version.
Pour is the requisite black with brown highlights. Fair enough. Head is average, but lace is disappointing.
Nose is roasted malt and some alcohol.
Tastes are HUGELY coffee based and the oatmeal stout distinction is nowhere to be seen. The oatmeal would normally expected to lend a hand in the creation of some creamy notes in the mouthfeel but they are distinct in their absence. If you are looking for an oatmeal stout you are going to be disappointed.
Thin in the mouth with that acidic, bitter, astrigent coffee aftertaste that one gets with poor quality coffee grinds.
Overall very poor with a drying finish and a pretty poor drinkability.
If there's one thing to be said for a number of these Scratch beers it's that Troegs knew what they were doing when they did NOT brew and release them the first time around!"
Brasserie Fantôme,Fantôme Black Ghost,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,8.00%,bottle,4.3,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,7/24/2009,"750 ml, capped and corked from the latest batch to make it to GA. Delighted to see this back in GA after a fairly lengthy absence due to production and distribution inconsistencies.
I think it's worth saying right off the top that this beer is fairly atypical of Fantome. It lacks some of the excessive funk that one often finds and whilst certainely ""spiced"", it's in a herbal manner which is somewhat out of the ordinary for them.
Pour is a turbid, murky brown Dubbel like body (not very attractive) with a better than expected head. Nice foam and surface film that persists.
A touch of alcohol and some herbal spice in the nose. Some fruit that rounds out the nose.
Tastes are more herbal notes. Somewhat reminiscent of a Cinzano Bianco (see my review of Lost Abbey 10 Commandments for the full story on that), but less fruity and MUCH more aggressive in the bitterness department. In fact, a little Angostura in there and a quite brutal finish. The harsh bitterness is surprising at the back end, but to be honest it's both manageable and fitting with the herbal nature of the beer.
As I say, lacks some of the usual Fantome character, but for me it's better for it. Certainly one of my favorite from Soy, and perhaps even my current, personal #1. Great stuff."
McAuslan Brewing,St-Ambroise Apricot Wheat Ale,,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,5.00%,bottle,3.35,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,7/24/2009,"12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Light orange pour with a soapy, thinnish head that fades quickly. Despite this the head imparts some decent, sticky lace - better than I was expecting.
Nose is a fairly strong, summer fruit aroma. It has elements of apricot but also some serious peach tones as well. A bit strong and sickly.
The nose runs right into the taste and we find similar attributes there. It tastes a little like one of those highly flavored, fruit chewing gums! Artificial and quite strong. Not much else going on here.
A summer refresher for sure, but after 12 oz I'm done. The tastes (fruit) start to grind a little and it gets a touch tiring for the palate.
Where's the wheat?? I dunno, it is distinct in its absence."
River Horse Brewing Co.,River Horse Tripel Horse,,,Tripel,10.00%,bottle,3.7,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,7/23/2009,"12 oz bottle from a recent trade.
OK, essentially this is a Quad. Right from the appearance, the ABV, through to the nose, the taste and the way it drinks.
Much darker that a standard tripel, the beer pours out a really dark orange. There is a very large amount of yeasty sediment in the viscous body. Head is small, but very sticky - both functions of the ABV.
Nose releases a slight sherry note which is reproduced to a greater extent in the taste. The body looks quite viscous. That's not a surprise given the ABV, but at the same time it seems too much for the style. LOTS of sherry and alcohol in the taste. Light burn in the finish. Nose is great, but the tastes seems a little weak. It's not a very good Tripel in my book, but at the same time it's a pretty nice beer.
Lacks white pepper and spice notes almost completely and in that respect is not in style at all. ABV is a touch high for a Tripel too and the appearance is darker than one would expect. In a blind taste I would obviously see this a Belgian, but no way would peg it as a Tripel. You can make up your own mind if you think that is a good or bad thing, but either way I quite enjoyed the beer."
Rogue Brewery (Brewer's on the Bay),Morimoto Soba Ale,,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,4.80%,bottle,4.05,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,7/23/2009,"22 oz bottle, Total Wine, Perimeter, Atlanta, GA, USA. The usual Rogue, screen-printed presentation. 
Very difficult to believe that I have not yet reviewed this brew, but here it goes.
Pour is a mid-orange with some nice soapy head. Head is persistent and leaves some sticky lace on the glass. 
Nose and tastes have a mild sweetness. A balanced beer by any standards but if you put it in the context of Rogue's, often over-hopped brews this is especially surprising. Reminds me a lot of an English Pale with the biscuity sweetness and the sensible ABV.
Very drinkable.
The beer also has a very creamy mouthfeel. Perhaps this comes from the Soba(?), but it adds to the drinkability.
Very tasty, the kind of low(ish) ABV, everyday drinking, balanced brew that one fins all too infrequently in the USA and especially surprising from a brewer like Rogue."
Brasserie Cantillon,Cantillon Iris,,,Lambic - Unblended,5.00%,bottle,3.95,4,4,4,3.5,4,7/19/2009,"Style #102 out of #103 reviewed on BA. Also, BA review #2000.
Black foiled neck, capped and corked. 2004 vintage, cork reads 2.006. Exactly the same bottle that I bought as a thank you for mikesgroove, and (from notes) the same beer that I have tried on more than one occasion in Belgium. Anyway, back to this bottle...
Poured into the Brasseries l'Abbaye des Rocs chalice the beer sits fairly still in the glass with a hazed, orange pour and some spotty lace and a decent white collar. No lace.
Mild acidity and moderate funk in the nose. Nothing out of the ordinary, but solid.
Dry and extremely potent grapefruit meet the tongue. Yes it's acidic, but for me it never gets to the ethanoic acid, vinegar situation. Unsurprisingly the grapefruit lingers and the funk (horse) manifests itself again in the aftertaste. Too me this is one of the more drinkable Cantillon beers. It does NOT lack acidity, on the contrary, but it seems to balance things nicely and the citrus notes temper the potentially harsh notes.
Definitely a citric note, and the lemon and grapefruit peel and pith seem to temper the vinegar potential.
Tasty, and this might be a good beer to show people what a REAL lambic is without scaring the living crap out of them!"
Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,Sah'tea,,,Sahti,9.00%,bottle,4.3,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,7/19/2009,"750 mL capped bottle from Arbor Place Beverage, Douglasville, GA, USA. $11.99. ""BOTTLED IN 2009"" dot-matrixed on the side of the bottle in yellow ink.
Based upon reviews, I went for the Tucher Weizen glass - it seems appropriate, and that particular glass shows off virtually any beer very nicely. The body is a slighly hazed, rich golden one with a white head that fades quickly. I guess the lack of head can be at least partly attributed to the ABV. Nice stream of carbonation comes from the bottom of the glass in a persistent fashion.
Nose gives alcohol, cloves, lemongrass. Strong on the lemon notes.
Tastes are initialy reminiscent of a lager shandy from England. This means a cheap macro lager with English lemonade (7-UP/Sprite like carbonated lemony beverage) added. It quickly moves away from this to give a more sophisticated note. There is a slightly viscous mouthfeel and the alcohol begins to become a little more apparent. More herbal qualities start to come through which must be a combo of the juniper and the chai tea. The finish adds a welcome and tasty (but minimal) bitterness. 
In summary, very tasty, very drinkable and a nice combo of alcohol and tastes. As usual, a nice re-working of a well established style with a typical DFH twist."
Abita Brewing Co.,Satsuma Harvest Wit,,,Witbier,5.10%,bottle,2.55,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,2,7/18/2009,"12 oz stubbie for the usual Abita presentation. Fairly low expectations like all Abita beers.
Weird yellow/green pour with a frothy but not dense head. Falls away quickly to leave no trace of lace or other sign that there was head present. Some haze.
Nose is Wit like with yeast notes and a very mild touch of spice. Disappointingly no orange in the smell. Bready overtones too. 
Weak in the taste department. Very yeasty and bready but not in a good Belgian way. Again zero orange character which is a shame.
Weak, watery mouthfeel completes the disappointing picture.
I dunno a real big chance missed. Unlike many, I don't dislike a fruity beer and I would have been happy to sample something with real orange character but this had literally none."
Brouwerij De Troch,Chapeau Faro Lambic,,,Faro,4.80%,bottle,3.55,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,7/18/2009,"12.7 oz green, dimpled-bottomed bottle. Cap is interesting, do you have one of these pghlee??
Out of the the capped and corked bottle (with no freshness date), it sits in the Brasserie l'Abbaye des Rocs chalice with a fairly ordinary presence with a brown body and some nice head. The head fades to give a collar and some film with minimal lace. Not really making itself known.
The nose offers some pretty strong fruit, with plums being the most obvious. Densely fruity with a touch of acidity.
The nose continues into the tastes quite faithfully. There is some big fruit upfront but fairly quickly we get a strongly acidic, slightly vinegary finish. It's not really offensive, but it is noticeably ethanoic acid in its nature! It also has a certain musty tasty which is reminiscent of old beer. Of course, with no freashness date of any description I have no idea how old this is. 
Creamy moutheffel completes the package.
Interesting and I quite enjoyed it, but I bet this is a massively different beer when;
a. fresh.
b. close to the source
c. in a draft version (if it exists)
Just another step on the journey - drink on!"
Magic Hat Brewing Company,Hi.P.A.,,,American IPA,6.70%,bottle,3.98,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,7/18/2009,"12 oz single.
Pour is a very average looking, slightly hazed, dark orange with a fair degree of haze. The head is a decent froth with some density and a good spotty covering and collar. Produces some decent lace.
Mild, simple hop profile in the nose which carries through to the taste. A malt profile that is quite large as well, which will probably upset some lovers of American IPA's. The balance is there, it's simple and it's, well...balanced! Imagine that! In that respect it is rather like its, superior, English origin. some noticeable fruit, notably peach and lemongrass. Smooth and drinkable.
Very tasty and probably a disappointment to many lovers of American IPA's. Of course, I enjoyed it very much!"
RJ Rockers Brewing Co.,Star Spangled Stout,,,American Stout,6.00%,bottle,3.88,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,7/17/2009,"12 oz bottle from casemw. Finally got around to trying this, hand-labeled, bootleg bottle from the source. Cheers.
Pour is a requisite blackish/brownish brown pour with those strage green highlights that a good stout sometimes produces (in my eyes at least!). A few ruby red highlights on standing. Head is small, poorly retained and doesn't create much lace - a bit of a let down considering the pretty nature of the body.
Nose has a simple, sweet balance that one would expect, with very mild hops competing with the dark malts for your attention.
A similar scenario plays out in the taste. A very light licorice, bitter finish completes the package. The malts are subtlely dark and roasted like a simple breakfast blend and without the harsh bitterness of a bolder brew. Some very fine, sand-like grains of yeast accompany the last pour from the bottle and settle at the bottom of the 16 oz glass. Quite creamy but paradoxically, also quite light in the mouth.
Tasty and one of the better beers from the RJR stable. Nice example. I'd like to try it fresher and on draft near the source. Would probably be be even better."
Southern Tier Brewing Company,Tripel,,,Tripel,9.00%,bottle,3.35,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,7/17/2009,"22oz bottle from Jim - cheers.
ST is a bit hit and miss to say the least with me, so it's always an interesting experience to open up a beer of theirs that I've no had before.
Pour yields a clear golden body with a frothy head. The whole thing seems a touch over-carbonated to me and the mouthfeel (prickly) confirms this.
The nose reveals some sweet hops, and to be honest it seems like the hops a re manifesting themselves a little too much.
The hop presence (too great IMO) is carried through to the taste. Whilst they certainly ARE plenty of Tripel elements (the sweetness, the slight peppery note, the alcohol, and the yeast), overall the package comes together in a way that is not typical of the style for me. There's too great a hop presence for my liking. That's NOT to say that this beer is ""hoppy"" as such, it isn't, but it seems to hop it's way a little out of style.
A little too much bitterness where sweetness should be, and a little too many hops where malts should be for me. Not a ""bad"" beer by any stretch of the imagination, but for me a touch ""off-style"" and for that I don't rate it highly.
Drinkable? Yes, but again not really a typical Tripel experience. Perhaps an example of the (fictious) ""American Tripel""! ;-)"
Deschutes Brewery,Jubelale,,,Winter Warmer,6.70%,bottle,4.13,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,7/16/2009,"12 oz single from a recent trade. 2008 vintage. I've been waiting on this beer for sometime. Delighted to get the chance to drink it.
The pour is just the way I like it; it has that noisy, richness with a dark, caramel color. The head is high, rich, dense and produces some lovely ice-cream like lace.
The nose and tastes have light alcohol and some delicate touches of spice. After the caramel notes subside, there is a mild hop bitterness that comes across the tongue. Nothing too spectacular, but enough to keep me alert. It defines the finish and the aftertaste. It's an interesting mix of solid malts with a bittering finish. Tasty.
Fits very neatly into the Winter Warmer category from all angles. The alcohol kicks in at the end and the hops seem cumulative - pleasing, satisfying and a beer that basically delivers. This beer is six months old and the hops are pretty much where they should be for MY taste. IF there has been a significant drop in hop character since this was fresh then I am DELIGHTED that I waited on this one. A bigger hop character is NOT what I would want in this style or from this beer - I'm a genius! ;-)"
Widmer Brothers Brewing Company,Drifter Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),5.70%,bottle,3.35,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,7/16/2009,"12 oz single, either from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA or perhaps Total Wine, Perimeter, Atlanta, GA, USA - the latter is more likely.
Pour has a nice, bright copper clarity and the head is initially quite good. The retention and lace of course, are disappointing. The head has an off-white hue. The body is a bit darker than I would expect for the stated style in fact quite a bit darker.
Nose and tastes are simple, light, malty, sweet caramel notes with a nice simple balance. This is more like a light amber than a Pale Ale to me, and the malt character outweighs most of the other possibilities for the beer. 
I'd be happy for a point or point and a half to be shaved off the ABV, but it still remains drinkable and has some sessionable quality in terms of its taste.
I probably wouldn't ever buy this again, but then again I wouldnt turn it down if it was offered to me. Unspectacular, and I'd much raher have a draft pint, but it's not bad."
Great Divide Brewing Company,15th Anniversary Wood Aged,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,10.00%,bottle,3.9,5,4,4,3.5,3.5,7/15/2009,"22 oz bottle, $7.95 from the relatively unlikely location of Cheers, Carrollton, GA, USA. Bottled on Jun 19, 2009. Black foil on the neck with a white cap.
This should be interesting - a style that I am not crazy about, with the additional element of wood aging that I generally don't enjoy, from a brewery that I have enjoyed in the past, but lately has put out a couple of beers that I have been less than impressed with! We'll see.
Pour is mid-amber, perfectly clear body with an amazingly high head. The retention and lace are both excellent. Looks very good. The second pour is cleaner and beautiful.
Nose is very alcoholic with plenty of vanilla from the oak. It is surprisingly sweet and malty for a beer that sits in the DIPA category.
The sweet vanilla, the malty character and the oak are continued straight into the taste. The hops don't even manifest themselves in the finish - they kick-in in the aftertaste and then linger somewhat. The hops are strong, dry, bitter and soapy. Dry aftertaste lingers on a backdrop of even more oak. Alcohol warms and even burns a tad, too.
A unique beer that REALLY showcases the oak in a much better and more positive way than I recall from almost any other attempt. It honestly begins to provoke thoughts of similarly produced wines - not in the taste as such, but in the marriage of the beverage with the wood aging.
Having said all of the positive things above, it's by no means an easy beer to drink. The strong presence of all of the elements, coupled with the ABV makes it start to wear a little on the palate after about half of the bottle. I'm not surprised by that of course."

Flying Fish Brewing Company,Farmhouse Summer Ale,,,American Blonde Ale,4.60%,bottle,3.48,2,3.5,3.5,3,4,7/14/2009,"Thanks go out to Jim for the chance to crack this one. 12 oz bottle.
Mmmmm, strange. An alarming, crystal clear pour with a macro like color and a carbonation to match. Looks ""ultra"" filtered!
Nose and tastes reveal soft malts and some grainy sweetness. This is categorized as a Saison?? It looks like (and has the mouthfeel) of a macro lager. It does have a nose and taste that gives more than that, but not a huge amount more and the experience is subtle to say the least. Some light, estery fruits and perhaps a touch of a grassy organic nature, but if you were expecting a typical Saison (American OR Belgian), forget it!
Odd, weird, and I'm not at all sure what is going on here. I'm a bit clueless with this beer. I like the ABV and the drinkability though."
Pabst Brewing Company,Stroh's Light,,,Light Lager,?,can,2.75,2,2,3,3,3,7/14/2009,"12 oz can from Arbor Place Beverage, Douglasville, GA, USA. $0.75 in the bargain cart - can't go wrong (I assume) - we'll see!
Pour is, as expected, very, very light yellow with a high head on the initial pour that fades to almost nothing within 60 seconds. Scant lace.
Nose and tastes reveal the standard macro ""nothingness"", and frankly this drinks largely like carbonated water.
On the plus side, it's in a can (handy) and is non-offensive (meaning no nasty, ""off"" tastes or skunky aftertaste). I suppose if I were in the market to buy or drink this kind of beer I could stomach it. That's about the best I can say, but on balance not bad for what it is (which is basically nothing)."
Butternuts Beer And Ale,Porkslap Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),4.30%,can,3.75,4,3,4,3.5,4,7/10/2009,"Delighted to find this 12 oz can at Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA as a single. Took this to the beach with me.
The pour reveals an orangeish body with some serious lace and decent retention. Sticky. I didn't really get much nose from the beer other than a malt based sweetness. Simple. Carbonation is not high, but melds well with the taste to produce a smoouth mouthfeel. Easy going.
The beer is actually rather sweet all around. Very malty and drinkable. There's something else in the beer which adds even more sweetness to the aftertaste but I'm having difficulty placing exactly what it is.
I think that you have to enjoy a sweeter beer to appreciate this and whether it fits classically into the APA category is a matter for some debate, but with the low ABV and my liking for malt based brews it means that this hit the spot for me. 
Cans are a bonus - nice one, I'll be drinking more of this in the future, hopefully at the beach!"

I was delighted to get hold of this as I was pretty sure that this would be a beer that I would never get the chance to try, but thanks go out to the generous trader that hooked me up.
One of my favorite brewers and one of my favorite style - hopefully, that will add up to success!
The pop on opening was not big, and I wonder if this has lost a little carbonation over the years. The pour also lacks much life. The body is a orange/amber hazed affair with very little head to speak of. The lace is also not really part of the equation.
Nose and tastes have some sweet, oxidized sherry notes alongside the Belgian yeast and candy. The body lacks much depth and the alcohol shines through at the end. There are some really eathy tones that come through as well - a touch of soil, which is always a sign of an older beer. A little plum as well. It has some Old Ale character which would be fine if it were and Old Ale but for this beer it seems a little off. Some over-ripe bananas too.
Although I generally don't mind the oxidation, in this case it's not doing it for me. I'm absolutely positive that this beer is past its best which is a huge shame. I wish that I could have got to the beer either fresh or at least a lot earlier than I did. If you've got 'em, drink 'em and QUICKLY!"
Brooklyn Brewery,Brooklyn Cuvee De Cardoz,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,8.50%,growler,3.6,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,7/9/2009,"64 oz growler sourced at Charleston Beer Exchange, Charleston, SC, USA.
Pour is a very pale, slightly hazed macro lager, yellowish color. Looks like a slightly watered down Duvel and lacks the large, fluffy head and retention and lace that one would expect to find in that classic.
Nose has a massive pear ester character. Absolutely HUGE! We still get the esters in the taste, but it is less pear based and more of a general alcoholic solvent. Some light, white pepper and spice, but not as large as some of the other reviews suggested.
If you like your BSPA's fruity then this is going to blow you away. If you prefer a more restrained fruit note with more pepper and spices with a drier character, then this is not going to work very well for you. This is a sweeter BSPA than most, and in that respect it certainly makes its own way.
I like Brooklyn and I love this style, I also like sweet beers but this is just a touch too over-the-top for me in terms of fruit. I'd like a drier note in my Belgian Strong Pales."
Smuttynose Brewing Company,Smuttynose Baltic Porter (Big Beer Series),,,Baltic Porter,9.00%,bottle,3.85,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,7/9/2009,"22 oz bottle, Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA. $5.49 I think. 
Pour is non-profoundly jet black with the requisite head. Solid if unspectacular.
Nose is very malty but a LOT of alcohol.
The alcohol theme is taken into the taste. Alcohol is the main feature with a touch of roastiness and some light charcoal. Alcohol makes repeated appearances but the whole package ultimately smooths out to be drinkable. It drinks every bit of its' 8.7%. Bitterness drops a number in the finish too. Light alcohol burn is in the mix as well.
It's a sipper no doubt, and I am surprised to the extent that the alcohol makes its presence felt. Having said that it's a nice example of the Americanization of the style from a solid brewer."

An extraordinary beer in many ways. Firstly the color is essentially that of a Pale Ale or perhaps even an IPA. It has a mid-amber hue which would be fine if it were a beer that SHOULD look like that, but if you had asked me to categorize this, any type of ""wheat"" beer would have been my last guess. This is are recurring theme at HHB though, so God knows what they are doing with their malts and grains. Perhaps they are just using one thing for all of their beers. The next problem was the way it was presented - ABSOLUTELY flat with zero life. Zero head (and therefore zero retention and lace) was the way it arrived. It looked ilike dirty wash water.



Ironically the taste was the best part of the beer. It has a fairly strong blueberry element and was quite sweet. Malty presence was high and the beer drank relatively cleanly with no unpleasant aftertaste either. Not exactly my favorite style or my favorite fruit, but I thought it was palatable. Having said that, if I had been looking for wheat presence I would have been horribly disappointed.



Another weak effort for this VERY strange ""brewpub"" - an odd beast since it seems that the beer is the last thing on their mind."

Updated Review 08/10
===
OK, it's now a year old, but the total write-off that 14th is, inspired me to re-visit 13th. $6.49 from Highland Beverage, Hiram, GA, USA for the 22 oz bottle.
Stone suggest NOT to cellar this, but...
...not quite the clarity "
Southern Tier Brewing Company,Mokah,,,American Double / Imperial Stout,11.00%,bottle,3.95,4,4,4,3.5,4,7/7/2009,"22 oz bottle from Charleston Beer Exchange, Charleston, SC, USA. $8.99.
A blend (or at least some mixture) of the Jahva and the Choklat.
Black , stout like body with a nice mocha head, decent retention and some lace. Ruby red highlights at the extremities.
Nose reveals an alcoholic chocolate and not much else.
The tastes lie heavily on the chocolate side of things with the coffee lending a certain bitterness but not much flavor. The coffee manifests itself in a licorice manner against the backdrop of the sweet, malty chocolate. 
Pretty smooth, but considering everything also pretty light. I was expecting something really dense and viscous and instead I got a beer that was significantly easier to drink than many others of the same, intense style and ABV. Talking of the ABV it was certainly present but in no way did it overwhelm the beer. Actually, I might even go as far as to say it was quite well hidden. Finishes with a blast of alcohol and a touch more bitterness. Not an ""easy"" beer to drink, but a lot easiER than you may anticipate.
Not a beer to have with any food other than desert, and probably a chocolate one at that! Outside of that it has to be consumed on its own, and the 22 oz bottle would be best shared with a friend.
I liked this more than I thought I would, but it's strictly a one-off beer that one appreciates more the longer one waits for another one."
Klosterbrauerei Neuzelle GmbH,Bathbeer,,,Munich Dunkel Lager,5.20%,bottle,3.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,7/6/2009,"$4.49 from Harris Teeter, Charleston, SC, USA.
Dark, chocolate brown pour with some nice head and lace. Looks substantial.
Creamy mouthfeel with a very earthy feel to the beer - I *think* it was advertised in the store as being organic, and this would fit with the general impression of the brew.
Good, mild nutty nose and tastes with plenty of semi-sweet caramel notes. I would not call the flavors or nose particularly ""roasty"", but it obviously sits on the side of darker malts rather than any hop character. Smooth.
Finishes nicely with a semi-dry bitterness.
Very drinkable and tasty, a nice example pof the style."
Mikkeller,USAlive!,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,8.00%,bottle,3.43,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,7/6/2009,"750 mL (synthetic) corked & caged, dimple-bottomed, brown bottle. Silver foil adorns the top. It came from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA a few weeks ago.
Pour is a mid-orange body (slight haze) with a high, frothy, cream soda/float like head. Lace is random. Decent retention.
The nose suggests (like the color) a dry-hopped IPA with some floral bitterness and a touch of brett. Drinkability is slow for me at first, but improves slightly as the bottle is consumed.
The tastes replicate the nose. To me, this is a very dry beer with essentially the feel and taste experience of a simple, American IPA. It's labeled as a ""Belgian Wild Ale"" and categorized on BA as a BSPA (which it ISN'T), but to me it drinks more like a Belgian IPA, and to be honest you'd be better off swapping ""American"" for ""Belgian"". The brett IS there, but to honest is feels like an afterthought. Finish is a little harsh and repeats the dry-hopped, bitter nature of the beer.
Think ""American IPA"" and I think you will be less surprised than I was in terms of what's in the bottle. To be honest, not really my cup of tea and I felt a little let down."
Avery Brewing Company,Avery Anniversary Ale - Sixteen,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,7.70%,bottle,4.23,4,4,4.5,4,4,7/5/2009,"$8.49 for the 22 oz, gold foiled bottle from Charleston Beer Exchange, Charleston, SC, USA.
Very interested to try this, as I have a few of the Twelve Saison left. The Saison re-birth in the Anniversary series should prove interesting and the side-by-side tasting should prove enlightening.
Pour is a hazy, light lemon affair with initially a high head but it disappears quickly to a spotty film and little or no lace. 
Nose is floral (I guess from the Jasmine) and there is a little acidic tartness in there too. Definite, dirty funk with light, sweet manure as well. 
The tastes are all quite highly carbonated and the honey and light, summer fruits come to the fore. More floral notes in the taste (Peaches are a floral contributor to my palate) and more honey. Dry finish and the whole thing is brought together with some alcohol. Some phenolic tastes and other fruit esters as well.
The mouthfeel is smooth which is surprising given the high level of carbonation. Not prickly at all. 
Incredibly drinkable and a beer that is perfect for summer boozing and has crossover potential. Only downside for those two, potential uses is the ABV which at just under 8% kinda screws both thing up a bit.
Tasty and drinkable."
Foothills Brewing Company,Gruffmeister 8,,,Maibock / Helles Bock,8.00%,growler,3.55,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,7/5/2009,"750 mL wine bottle bomber from Laura Alberts, Charleston, SC, USA. $7.50 for the mini-growler/bomber/wine bottle. Another of my favorite styles from another of my favorite brewers. 
Pour is a very distinct, clear golden body with a small amount of pure white head. Not much retention and a little lace.
Smell is very boozy. Some nice malty notes too.
Tastes reflect the nose. This drinks easily though, at least considering the presence of alcohol in the taste. To be honest I was getting nervous as I was drinking it as the alcohol seemed very solvent like. I was thinking, ""I bet this could give you a nasty headache"". Some very simple drying character in the finish and a beer that screams caution.
It's clean and relatively crisp in the mouth, again a feature of the prominent alcohol I feel."
SweetWater Brewing Company,Sweetwater Dank Tank DP Barleywine Ale,,,American Barleywine,10.20%,bottle,2.65,3.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,2,7/5/2009,"22 oz bottle, Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA. $5.99.
OK, not really sure what's going on here, but I guess I will try to unravel it.
The pour offers a reddish, hazed body with little or no head except for a small collar. The head has poor retention (probably due in large part to the ABV) and the collar leaves a little lace. Carbonation seems low to me, but in line with a beer with this kind of alcohol.
What we have here is the proverbial ""kitchen sink"" beer. It comes across as a kind of American Double IPA/English Barleywine clone to me, with more sweetness than ANY American Barleywine has ever had. If you are judging this beer on its ability to replicate that particular style, then you have a failure. It also lacks the true, forward, aggressive hops that one would expect from an American DIPA as well, with plenty of caramel notes coming through and a tremendous (as in large rather than good), malt presence. Of course, it also lacks the subtle, sherry-like notes and nuances of an English Barleywine and therein lies the problem. This beer is neither one thing or another and tops of the whole package with a silly ABV. It's what I imagine a bad Stone beer to be!
Same problem as the original DP from 2007 in terms of the style being all over the place.
Two into the cellar, one more glass on draft and I'll be done. Much less impressive than Ron Burgandy and another American brewer's attempt to ""show off"" with massive ABV and just too much of everything but ultimately yielding next to nothing. Disappointing."
Weyerbacher Brewing Co.,Muse Farmhouse Ale,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,6.20%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,7/5/2009,"Delighted to get the chance to snag this one at Charleston Beer Exchange, $4.79 for the 22 oz bomber. Another of my favorite styles from a very respectable brewer, hope it's good!
Pour is a fairly dark, orange one with a decent amount of head, lace and retention. White foam on to of the hazed body. Looks good in the wine glass.
Light spice notes in the nose.
Taste are more dense than some Saison's with some citrus, marmalade tastes and a delicate notes of mace (or something similar). The Belgian yeasts and sugars are very dominant but also totally appropriate.
The finish is a touch tart and has the Saaz bitterness that I normally associate with a Pils. Clean and satisfying, this beer is *slightly* outside of the normal realm of Saison's in my opinions (it's got some phenol character that one might associate with a tripel), but it does fit at the edge of the style and it is a nice beer."
Butternuts Beer And Ale,Snapperhead IPA,,,American IPA,6.80%,can,4.78,4.5,4.5,5,4,5,7/2/2009,"Well, well, well, what do we have here? DELIGHTED to see this make it to the GA market for a whole bunch of reasons. I got this single 12 oz can from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
OK, let me give the summary right off the top. This beer is a VERY atypical American IPA. If you are looking for a representative beer in that style/category you are going to be disappointed, I on the other hand, am absolutely DELIGHTED with this beer.
Firstly it's great to have the added flexibility of craft beer in cans. Makes me wish that I found myself in situations where I really needed cans more often. This beer makes me think that I might deliberately find a few situations.
Light copper body with some significant haze. The head is magnificent and the lace is tremendous. Some of the best head and lace that I've seen in some time. Looks great.
The nose and tastes reflect a delicate, light hop touch and a balanced, sweet malt biscuit subtlety. It's a very nicely balanced beer with a kiss of hops in the finish and the aftertaste mellow and creamy.
This beer reminds me INTENSELY of an English Bitter. To be an exact replica we would need an ABV that was about 3 points lower, BUT the beauty of the beer is that it drinks very much like a beer that IS 3 points lower! Very smooth with a silky mouthfeel and drinkability is off the charts for me.
WOW, what a massively unexpected delight. Superb; I bet many American geeks will dislike this beer a lot, it's just too subtle."
Mendocino Brewing Company,Special Edition - White Ale,,,Witbier,?,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,7/2/2009,"12oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Interesting as I found this beer more substantial than the Weyerbacher Blanche that I drank alongside it - I was expecting the opposite to be true.
Mendocino has a habit of producing so fairly average (if solid) beers, followed by the occasional really good one. For me, the White Ale was one of the better efforts.
Pour was a murky, slightly orange affair with a solid head with good retention and lace. The beer looked solid in the Southampton Weizen glass.
Nose gives hints of what is to come in the taste with some significant orange notes and the usual spices. The beer drinks a touch bigger than one might think. Even a bit of viscosity in the body to back up the citrus based taste. Definitely more body and more depth of taste than many in the style, it drank nicely.
Very enjoyable, and a bit of a bigger brew than I was anticipating all around. Solid effort."
Red Brick Brewing Company,Red Brick Solstice Roggenbock,,,Roggenbier,?,on-tap,3.38,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,7/2/2009,"On tap at Taco Mac Metropolis on 06/23/09 - from notes; 16 oz pour. 30 year anniversary beer for TM from ABC.
In summary, unoffensive but not much character that would suggest that this is a Roggenbier.
The pour is a very surprising bright yellow affair with good clarity, some nice head and decent lace. Looks are possibly the strongest feature of this brew.
Light on taste, in fact rather sweet. Almost no rye taste when compared to some other beers that contain the grain. Simple malty, bread like notes.
Pretty drinkable but this is really based upon the simplicity of the beer rather than anything spectacular."
Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),Samuel Smith's Organic Strawberry Fruit Beer,,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,5.20%,bottle,3.53,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,7/2/2009,"500 mL bottle from Hop City, Atlatna, GA, USA.
Poured into a wine glass. Pour is a strawberry blonde body, well carbonated with a slightly off-white, high head. Retention and lace are very good.
Mild, sweet fruit in the nose. Seems balanced.
Strawberry juice is present in the tastes but it is fairly muted. Definitely the most reserved in terms of fruit of the three Smith's fruit beers (Cherry and Raspberry being the others). Sweet and sour which finishes quite dry. Malts dominate. Extremely drinkable in the Atlanta summer heat, but for me this is largely a novelty, very ocassional beer. Light, natural and not cloying, all important in a fruit based beer.
Enjoyable but not my favorite of the three Smith's fruit beers."
Weyerbacher Brewing Co.,Blanche,,,Witbier,5.00%,bottle,3.18,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,7/2/2009,"12 oz single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA. In a nutshell, a simple brew that fits nicely in style from a reliable brewer.
Pour is a very typical, light, lemom-yellow affair with a light head that is gone fairly quickly. Not much lace. Looks like a solid player in the Tucher Weizen, 500 mL glass.
Very simple, mild citrus and a touch of spice (coriander ?) but not much else. Light tart finish. Very easy, light drinking but little to report here. Mouthfell is in line with the style and the carbonation is fine.
The Atlanta summer lends itself well to this kind of beer, but this is not a stand-out in any way, so it will probably just fit nicely into the normal rotation without much fuss. Simple beer with an ABV that helps. Not much of a departure from more well-known imports, and if truth be told I'd rather have the original(s)."
Great Divide Brewing Company,Double Wit,,,Witbier,8.10%,bottle,3.45,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,7/1/2009,"22 oz gold foiled neck in the newish Great Divide packaging. Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour produces a very high, light head with very good retention and decent lace. The body is golden with a very slight haze. Light carbonation.
Nose is a fruity, funky, light alcohol that is pretty astringent. It smells a little like an overripe banana. It's a little strong.
Alcohol is very prominent in the taste, even to the point of being a touch solvent like. It drinks a lot easier than that but he taste is quite alcoholic. There's some light coriander notes, a touch of white pepper and the usual spices, but the overwhelming feeling that I get is that of the ""Imperialized"" version of the style. More squishy bananas round out the beer. It has a slightly slick mouthfeel but not as bad as it initially promised it could be.
I'm not sure about this one. It reminds me a little of the GD Saison which, because of the alcohol in that one, was a big miss with me. This was better, but it still sits a touch oddly with me. I think it comes down to the question, ""should this style be amped up?"" I suppose it CAN, but it is a VERY, VERY fine line between success and relative failure.
I think I'll come back to this one again to be sure, but out of the box, it doesn't quite do it for me."
The Lost Abbey,Red Barn Ale,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,6.70%,bottle,4.78,4.5,4,5,5,5,6/28/2009,"750 mL, olive green, corked and caged bottle. Very healthy pop with plenty of gun smoke on opening - a ""Lost Abbey based"" sigh of relief.
Beautiful, honey hazed, orange pour with a tight, white head. Lace is superb - dense with complex patterns. Some of the best I've seen in the Gouden Carolus chalice.
Nose has creamy fruits and white pepper.
Tastes are very mellow. Light touches of white pepper, some spices, gentle, ripe summer fruits like sweet peaches, pineapples and a floral backdrop. Extremely gentle grapefruit mingles with those flavors and the combination is exceptional. Some sweet and sour notes in the finish and this is where the spice manifests itself again. Light bitterness lingers for a few seconds after that mouthful.
It's extremely light and silky in the mouth. Satisfying, moreish and delightful. Full and blossoming.
Drinkability is helped by the light touch and the sensible, if slightly elevated ABV. Subtle is a word that comes to mind, which in itself is unusual for an American beer but this brew even goes beyond that. 
Quite possibly the best Lost Abbey offering I've had. Amazing."
Brasserie Fantôme,Fantôme La Dalmatienne,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,8.00%,bottle,3.83,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,6/26/2009,"Thanks go out to J & J at Bruisn' Ales for the chance to try this 750 mL, capped, green bottle @ $15.00.
Pour is a light, brownish/orange with some sediment and a chill-hazed appearance. Head is big and bright early on, more reserved later. Lace is OK. Large amount of fine, muddy brown sediment comes with the final pour.
Nose and tastes reveal a typical Fantome, funk and fruit, but this one lays more heavily on the fruit side of things for me. Very grape orientated with vinous note of chardonnay grapes coming through quite strongly. Without the funk it would remind me of Allagash Victor/Victoria.
Carbonation seems a touch on the low side, but it drinks simply and nicely with a very fruity finish. Definitely one of the fruitier Fantome's in the stable an din that respect a little atypical."
Triangle Brewing Company,Triangle Belgian Golden Ale,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,8.00%,bottle,4.2,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,6/26/2009,"22 oz bottle, $9.75 via mail from Bruisin' Ales. Thanks J & J.
Pour gives a large, rocky head with is persistent and leaves tremendous lace. The body is a touch darker than I would like for the style, exuding a hazy, cloudy orange rather than the golden yellow I was looking for. Still, the combination is pretty good looking nevertheless.
Nose has a great combo of BIG Belgian style yeasts and some white pepper. Tremendous promise in the aroma.
Tastes reflect the nose which is great, but also add some Belgian candy notes. It's strange because the tastes tend to accentuate the sugar sweetness rather than the spicy pepper and yeast, which is a shame. Sweeter than the nose would suggest.
Still a very nice interpretation but I would advise a color adjustment and an emphasis in the taste that the nose would suggest. Still drinks extremely well, and is a really good effort at the real thing from an American brewer. Enjoyable and drinkable."
Harpoon Brewery,Harpoon Leviathan - Imperial IPA,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,10.00%,on-tap,4,4,4,4,4,4,6/24/2009,"On-tap, Taco Mac Metropolis, Atlanta, GA, USA. 16 oz pour.
Solid orange color, tight head with some good retention and lace. Looks as it should.
Big whiff of (what appears at first) to be a ""West Coast"" style hop profile. This does get toned down a little as the beer warms. This is repeated in the tastes and the beer drinks as though it's out of California to me. There's some residual sugary notes too, but to be honest this beer is what it is - a large DIPA with nothing much else going on.
Aftertaste lingers and is lightly metallic. Some great hoppy burps which for me are always a good sign of a solid, American DIPA.
This is a beer that I would need to have a craving for, and that happens infrequently. If you do get ""that"" DIPA craving then this is going to serve you well.
It's not ""bad"" as such, but talk about a YAAAWWWNNN factor - ANOTHER, HUGE ABV, DIPA; why bother? It's a nice version of the style, but c'mon, enough already."

I'm really not at ALL sure what style of this beer is supposed to be and S&N's web site (including the Heineken USA site) reveals nothing. HILARIOUSLY, a 'phone call to Heineken USA in White Plains, NY connects me with a courteous young man who tells me that no such beer exists - he takes my number and promises more research!

***
PLEASE NOTE: I've entered it here as a Hefe, but I would not be at ALL surprised to be told it was something else entirely.
***

The beer pours like a Wheat/Hefe, with a cloudy, distinctly yellow color and a frothy, light, white head. To be honest it looks pretty good. After the appearance, things go downhill fast.
An insipid, plastic taste and smell come forth and of course the body is watery. It has a touch of fruity banana in there too, but is this an attempt at a Hefe?? I just don't know. There's just no character here at all. The odd artificial taste lingers to produce a funny aftertaste as well.
Depressingly, obviously marketing fodder for the masses.
It's tricky to enter this into the BA db, and to review it because I'm not all that sure what it is trying to be and in fact, at this point in tome, NEITHER is Heineken USA! Comments and corrections welcome!"

Pour is an extreme clear solution with a modicum of bubbles. Head is disappointing and lace is non-existent.
Nose is typically macro-adjunct like with a boiled vegetal note. Tastes reflect that and are even more disappointing since I was anticipating some degree of honey-sweetness. As far as I can tell there is none of that, which, if it had been there, would have been a saving grace.
Uninterseting beer that I will not drink again."
Brewery Ommegang,Ommegang Rouge,,,Flanders Red Ale,5.50%,on-tap,4.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,6/22/2009,"Stumbled across this at Summits Wayside, Woodstock, GA, USA last week and was delighted to see it. I thought that I was going to miss out on this brew, but happily got to catch up with it by chance.
Served in a Gulden Draak tulip, the beer sits with a brownish-red body and a small head that disappears quickly. Better lace than I was anticipating.
Nose and tastes do a great job of replicating the style nicely, but at the same time give a degree of accessibility that is somewhat unusual for this style (hence the high drinkability score). Light vinegar in the nose and a delicate sourness on the tongue at first. It's fairly one-dimesional to me, but that's OK since there is balance with a touch of tart fruitiness/fruit skins in there too. Obviously some tannin character too with a dry, tea like ending.
To me this is a beer which doesn't do much other than what the style demands (a good thing) and also remains approachable. It's the kind of beer that I *think* could be used as a crossover, or at least an opportunity to introduce a non-craft beer person to a dramatically different style without scaring the life put of them. Don't get me wrong, it IS a beer that would scare some, and I know it's generally not a style that can act as a gateway brew, but in the grand scheme of the style it's very approachable.
The way I would describe it is accessible but authentic - not an easy thing to pull off with this style. Good job as usual by Ommegang."
Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,Sierra Nevada Brown Saison,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,7.90%,on-tap,4.38,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,6/22/2009,"16 oz pour, Summits Wayside Tavern, Woodstock, GA, USA.
I've been fairly critical of SN in the past for over-hopping their beers so that so many of them taste so similar (The Harvest series, SNPA, Anniversary series, Torpedo, ESB, to some extent even celebration etc., all seem like clones of the same, hoppy-based beer to me with little or no imagination), so I always approach their beers with a degree of skepticism to say the least. However, on this ocassion we got a really nice brew.
I'm not really sure where the saison element comes in with this beer becasue to me it drank purely and simply like a solid, English Brown Ale. What does that mean? Well, malt based, sweet, medium to high body with a solid refreshing blast. Light roasted flavors and a lingering finish that leaves you wanting more. It poured in the same manner by looking substantial and giving an excellent rocky, off-white head and some decent lace. Alcohol is well hidden although, of course, I wish it were ACTUALLY lower in ABV rather than just TASTING lower in ABV.
As I say, I don't really understand the saison part of this beer, but if you are looking for a sweet, malty brew I'd say this was a good bet. Highly quaffable too. Take 3-4% off the ABV and you'd have a pretty good, sessionable Englishesque beer."
George Bateman and Son Ltd. / Batemans Brewery,Bateman's Combined Harvest,,,English Pale Ale,4.70%,bottle,3.2,3,3.5,3,3,3.5,6/21/2009,"500 mL bottle from Bruisn' Ales at the second time of asking - I broke my first bottle from there when I was transporting it home.
Pour is an alarmingly clear, apparently over-carbonated bright gold with an equally alarming (considering the number of bubbles in the body of the beer) lack of head. Lace is also scant.
Nose and tastes give a grainy sweetness with some simple, English biscuit malts but not much else. Some light fruits. Great drinkability in the Atlanta heat, BUT this beer is a worry to me. In the first instance it seems to have crossed the line from Pale Ale into the contemporary, English ""Golden Ale"". I am beginning to hate that ""style"" since I see it as nothing more than an effort on the part of the brewers to bow to lowest common denominator demand by dumbing down their Pale Ales and Bitters to macro lager like extents. I FULLY understand that brewers need to make a profit, and that they need to respond to consumer demand, but it pains me when brewers like Bateman's seem to be giving in - a sign of the Apocalypse?
I dunno, I guess the brewers are not really to blame, it's more a function of the dumbed down public in the face of macro lager advertising, but I am still bothered by it. I just don't think that Bateman's would have brewed a beer that tasted like this 5 or 10 years ago.
Maybe I've got it all wrong, but for me this beer is a sham and a shame."
Pisgah Brewing Co.,Endless Summer Ale,,,American Blonde Ale,?,growler,3.93,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,6/21/2009,"64 oz growler from Bruisn' Ales. Thanks J & J.
Opens with an encouraging release of gas with a loud ""pphhtt""! Crystal clear, light golden pour with a very nice head. Some decent lace as well. Carbonation is on the high side, but completely in line with the style.
Nose reveals a touch of grassy herbal hops.
Tastes are quite bitter. Almost a Saaz like pils finish as well. Finishes dry and bitter too.
This is a surprisingly bitter beer which is not necessarily a bad thing. It has more character than I was expecting and definitely fits the profile for a summer, hot weather sessionable beer. I use the word ""sessionable"" with caution since I don't know the ABV. I'd like to know what it is. It seems like it IS sessionable, I just we'll see! Dry ending fitting for the pseudo pils style that the beer imparts.
Very light drinking and I would say this is very enjoyable in the context of the weather and the style. The organic angle adds to the experience as well and Pisgah proves that they have a wide portfolio."
Brouwerij De Ranke,Noir De Dottignies,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,9.00%,bottle,4.18,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,6/20/2009,"Paper-wrapped 750 mL, capped bottle in typical De Ranke presentation mode. This came from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Popping the cap produces a touch of gunsmoke but the pour produces a pretty lively beer. Some really substantial, thick, bubbly head that lingers and leaves good lace. Body is a slightly murky, dark Dubbel like affair. 
Nose is quite frankly not huge, but it does give a strong whiff of a hop base rather than a Belgian fruity/estery/yesty/candy note. I suppose this is in line with the De Ranke philosophy.
As is so often the case, the tastes largely reflect the nose with fruits, raisins and esters, whilst although present, taking a backseat to the hoppy edge that makes a De Ranke beer, a De Ranke beer! Finishes with a malty bitterness which is an unusual combo. There's a touch of lingering metallic coinage too, but it's not harsh and adds to the experience rather than detracting from it. As it warms the esters and yeasts come to the fore with greater alacrity and clarity.
Insanely drinkable, the alcohol is nowhere to be seen.
Definitely an edgy BDSA, and not the kind of thing that I usually go for since I feel the fruit, the esters, yeasts and malts should be upfront and strong in this style, BUT given it is a De Ranke I was expecting this so I feel less disappointed than I otherwise might have. Either way, tasty stuff and a difficult beer to put down."
Kuhnhenn Brewing Company,Kuhnhenn Raspberry Eisbock,,,Eisbock,13.50%,bottle,4.98,4.5,5,5,5,5,6/20/2009,"Perhaps the beer that I have sought more than any other over the course of the last few years. Delighted to have a chance to get my hands on this one at last.
2007 vintage, 6.3 oz green bottle. Dark red waxed and capped. Rustic looking, parchment type label.
Deliberately poured into a wine glass rather than a beer snifter.
Toffee colored body with a minimal amount of bubbly head and lace. Beer sits still in the glass. Swirling produces some fantastic alcohol legs on the glass.
The nose is beautifully subtle and rich. Chocolate, cocoa, light raspberries, Madiera and sherry notes too. As the beer warms there are more and more raspberries that come to the fore. Some dry, baking chocolate in there too.
The tastes are SILKY smooth with a big rush of alcohol upfront and then raspberry seeds in the back end. Finishes surprisingly dry, but I assume that this is another function of the raspberries.
It drinks like a classy liquer and is perfect for a digestif. Other beers are sometimes touted in the this role but most don't fit the bill. For me, this one does and it reminds me of a (somewhat dry) Madeira. Alcohol is present and warming but perfect for the beer.
This is one of the very few beers that I would go out of my way for - I knew I would love this, and I was right."
Brouwerij De Graal,De Graal Gember,,,Herbed / Spiced Beer,8.00%,bottle,4.05,4,4,4,4.5,4,6/18/2009,"750 mL capped bottle from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA. Very different label to the one pictured in the BA db. Notched as being best before May 2009.
Mild fizz on opening.
Poured into the Gouden Carolus chalice, the beer is a hazed, bright yellow and is reminiscent of the best Wits. Head is made up of fine bubbles and somewhat thin. Some lace.
Ginger is present in very light amounts, but the beer is definitely herbal. The general spice is quite strong with the specific ginger notes a touch more muted. Some yeasty, Belgian candy mixed in too. Pretty mild, and except for the obvious herbal qualities the beer is what I would characterize as ""neutral"".
Drinks very much like a traditional Ginger beer, and in that respect is rather odd, especially for a Belgian beer. Ignoring that for a moment it is incredibly drinkable and a really nice summer, quaffing, crossover beer.
Although it is easy to drink, the herbal notes do get a touch tiring on the palate after a while.
Good value, tasty, drinkable and interesting. Difficult to ask for more."
Brauerei Schloss Eggenberg,Doppelbock Dunkel,,,Doppelbock,8.50%,bottle,3.45,3.5,4,3.5,3,3,6/17/2009,"Somewhat surprising.
Single from Total Wine, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour yields a very dark brown body with some bubbly head that fades fairly quickly. Nothing much to report here.
Nose gives a slight sherry note, with a sweet Old Ale aroma. It promises much.
Upfront tastes are malt driven as expected and there are some fruits, a touch of alcohol (although not a smuch as the ABV would suggest) and some simple, DB like features (more sweetness).
The beer is a little odd in as much as the mouthfeel is rather light, lacking depth, and in that I get a distinct licorice like finish exploding across the back end. I'd even go as far as to say it gets a bit stout like, with a dry, strangely astringent bitterness that seems out of place. The drinkability suffers for me as a result. Strong aftertaste.
Strange stuff; seemed well balanced upfront and then went a bit wierd at the end."
Nørrebro Bryghus,Old Odense,,,Herbed / Spiced Beer,7.50%,bottle,4.15,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,6/17/2009,"500 mL bottle that came from Green's, Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA. I actually bought this fro a trade that for one reason or another, fell through. Cost somewhere between $15 and $20 from memory - EXPENSIVE!
TAP: 140208; MHT 110210
Hazed copper body with some head, but the head is forced by the aggression of the pour. Some film and collar left.
Nose has plenty of fruit notes (cherry, pineapple and apple) but all are laced with a slightly sour character.
The beer drinks with some of those fruity characteristics, but more light vinegar and sourness than the nose would suggest. There is a dry character too, which is a bit like white wine or even champagne. Seems ""classy"". Finish continues with a real, sweet and sour combo.
Acidic fruits are the watch-words here, and the beer is very nicely balanced between the two. I would describe it as a cross between a really sour lambic and a fruit beer. Quite a strange combination, but it comes together rather well.
Nice beer, unusually and tasty, but ridiculously expensive and it that regard very poor value for money."
Tröegs Brewing Company,Scratch Beer 18 - 2009,,,Rye Beer,7.30%,bottle,3.2,4,4,3,3.5,2.5,6/17/2009,"12 oz bottle.
Hazy orange body sits underneath a white, bubbly head that forms quickly on top. A thin film is left on the beer as the pour settles. No lace in the Terrapin snifter.
Nose and tastes are dominated by citrus hops. The rye takes a back seat, and at first I would not have put his down as anything other than an American IPA. The dry finish gives the rye away somewhat, but outside of that the beer takes on a typical, fairly harsh American IPA stance.
It's a pretty aggressive beer in terms of bitterness, but I would say that it IS in check but not really my particular cup of tea. I don't dislike the beer, but I do not find it easy to drink. A touch hot in terms of alcohol too (not it terms of the size of he ABV, but rather in terms of its presence). Lingering bitterness is the overwhelming experience here.
I dunno, not a bad beer but I find it quite harsh - not subtle, and not one that makes for easy drinking."
Southern Tier Brewing Company,Imperial Cherry Saison,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,10.10%,bottle,2.15,3.5,3.5,1.5,3,1.5,6/16/2009,"Absolutely do not understand this beer in the slightest.
Firstly there is a huge reference to cherries from the name through to the picture of the giant fruit on the bottle, and secondly there is the oaking of the beer which, even before I tasted it gave me some serious reservations as to why one would be trying to combine that with a fruit infused saison. I was just afraid that it would not come together at all well, and I was right.
Pour is a hazed orange; fairly typical for the style, but what's the deal with the fruit? You would expect the cherry to add some kind of color (even artificial looking), but no, there's nothing. Head is OK, some lace.
Nose gives a pleasant, light vanilla note on top of the alcohol and mild grassy, organic nose.
Then we get to the tastes. For me this beer was close to undrinkable as the oak notes overpowered everything else that the beer was trying to do. Dry and VERY strong, it tasted a bit like chewing on matchwood. Very uninteresting, and the second half of the bottle was a drain pour for me. VERY unusual for me to do that, but I just couldn't get this one to go down. My guess is that ST was trying to introduce a sour note with the cherries; fine, but why then overwhelm the beer with the oak too? There was no hint of cherry either artificial or natural for me. It's an example of trying too hard and being too clever.
Odd combination out of the gate and the whole thing is a bit of a disaster in my book. It failed to come together - failed experiment."
Terrapin Beer Company,Terrapin 90 Shelling Scotch Ale,,,Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy,7.30%,bottle,3.3,4,4,3,3.5,3,6/13/2009,"Finally a review of #6 in the Side Project Series.
22 oz bottle that I think came from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA. The usual presentation for the SP series, gold foiled, generic label etc.
Good looking, dark garnet pour that form a nice, tight, white head, some lace and a nice stream of carbonation. Looks solid in the glass.
Nose reveals dark malts, sweetness and some alcohol, but again is fairly solid.
Tastes are in style, BUT two things;
The body lacks depth for me. In a SA/WH I'm looking for a considerable richness and this beer comes up a notch short for me.
The tastes are close, but the alcohol seems WAY TOO prevalent for me. I'm not saying that we should be looking for a lower ABV, but I am saying that we should be looking for a less obvious EtOH presence. I'd even go as far as to say it begins to take on a bit of a solvent like finish. Lacks smoothness.
This short-coming also manifests itself in the mouthfeel which, for the style seems to lack depth and is a touch thin.
Decent, but seems a little boozy to me."
Lagunitas Brewing Company,2009 Correction Ale,,,American IPA,6.30%,bottle,3.95,4,4,4,3.5,4,6/12/2009,"With a few exceptions you can pretty much rely on Lagunitas to put together a solid, good value beer and this is NOT one of those exceptions.
22 oz bomber all but a drop goes into the Youngs, imperial pint glass.
Color is pretty striking and indeed, just plain pretty. A deep, golden orange with great clarity. Head is a touch disappointing though, as is the retention and lace. It gives the beer a bit of ""thin"" look. In relaity the mouthfeel is a notch below ""good"".
Big C hops with a touch of citrus lime and grapefruit come down. A touch of orange peel, or is that the color playing tricks on my mind? Clean tasting beer but also enjoys a ligering, bitter, slight coinage finish and aftertaste - all well in check so enjoyable.
I like this beer since it has ""American"" written all over it but at the same time it doesn't get silly in terms of its ""over-the-topness"". Another Lagunitas solid offering - reliable beer from an American brewer with common sense."
Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,Sierra Nevada IDEA,,,American IPA,?,on-tap,3.98,3.5,4,4,4,4,6/12/2009,"Had this on tap at Manuel's, Atlanta, GA, USA.
16 oz pour. A bit turbid in the glass, not an especially attractive beer.
A bit of a strange brew to say the least. Not sure how I would categorize it but it seemed to me like a cross between a brown ale and an IPA. To me, that generally means ""American Brown Ale"" with some of the appearance of a brown, but a hoppier presence that would otherwise be expected in such a beer.
There are some dark malts present up front, and given SN's liberal use of hops all over the place, I was expecting a bitter blast coming at me to accompany the mellower start. Although some bitterness did come through, all in all it was actually LESS hoppy than I expected, GIVEN SN's usual heavy-handedness.
Nice lace and a well sustained head, the beer has some nice balance and to be honest I enjoyed more than I thought I would. Decent drinkability, it slid down a little quicker than I was expecting. Interesting, and glad I got to try it."

Pour gives a mid orange/amber body with an alarming number of air bubbles clinging to the inside of the glass. The bubbles clear to yield a white, smallish haed that leaves very little lace and fades to a thin layer on the surface of the beer. Color seems a bit light.
Nose and tastes are mainly simple, pale malts and the beer drinks in a similar manner, but it has a really astringent, dry rye note that is a bit overbearing. I'm not a huge fan of rye in general but this seems way out of balance. I didn't like it at all.
The finish is not clean either, and it leaves an unpleasant tannin like feel coating the teeth.
Overall the rye did a number on me and the second half of the bottle was a drain pour. Ho hum."
Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),Samuel Smith's Organic Raspberry Fruit Beer,,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,5.10%,bottle,3.68,5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,6/10/2009,"Intresting to say the least. I first came across the cherry version of this, bottled in London in the summer of 2007. I quite enjoyed that, so I thought it would be a good bet that I would like the raspberry and strawberry version recently arrived in the US - started with the Raspberry.
500 mL bottle from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA. $5.99. 
The beer pours with an amazingly deep, crimson color and a HIGH, pinkish head. Decent lace. Doesn't look a great deal like beer, but it IS exceptional in its appearance, hence the ""5"". Carbonation seems high at first but settles down to be more ""beer-like"".
Nose has an acidic fruitiness that I would not necessarily associate with raspberries, but it does smell fruit based and not ""fake"". Seems natural.
Lots of raspberries in the taste and up front that is all that one can really experience, BUT as the beer drinks down the bottle I find that the fruit notes begin to fade a little, more dry, almost lager like malts start to come through. By the end of the bottle the beer is finish more like beer than fruit juice.
In the end it is VERY drinkable, but it IS a context/novelty beer for me. Sam Smith's has obviously taken the low road here and gone for the combo market of women, youngsters, summer, novelty, organic and sweetness. I'd imagine that in those markets this will do well. I prefered the cherry version; strawberry is up next."
Anchor Brewing Company,Anchor Summer Beer,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,4.60%,bottle,3.05,3,3,3,2.5,3.5,6/8/2009,"Seems strange to have not reviewed this over the years, so it's about time I did.
Classic, Anchor bottle with e usual dot-matrixed code on the rear - 9MK (difficult to be sure if the last letter is actually that).
Pour is a surprisingly well carbonated golden, clear body underneath a rocky id somewhat flimsy head. A multitude of bubbles accumulate on the inside of the glass.
BIG fan of te ABV which adds to the drinkability of this beer and saves it for me a little.
It drinks a little like a macro lager to be honest. Some cleaner lines that one might expect to find in most of those, but nevertheless it's very light, carbonated drinking. The carbonation bothered me a touch. Although this is clearly described as a wheat beer, it's a wheat beer where the wheat is not really evident much at all. In that respect it's a little confusing.
In the end it's fine, but I don't care for this beer a great deal and NOT because of its simplicity, more because of the strange level of carbonation and the ""wheat"" confusion."
Rogue Brewery (Brewer's on the Bay),Somer Orange Honey Wheat,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,5.20%,bottle,4.15,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,6/7/2009,"As usual with Rogue, it's EXTREMELY difficult to tell if this is just another alias for another one of their brews since they have so many re-naming projects going on, but because of the thread below, and because of searching around (including Rogue's site) and finding nothing, I *think* that this has a chance of being a new brew and something that should be added to the db. Anyway, it can be moved if it does turn out to be an alias of a beer already in the db (I am pretty sure this is NOT the Honey Wheat currently listed). I'm also not sure of the style, but it DOES have wheat in it, and it does resemble a pale wheat, so hear we go!



http://beeradvocate.com/forum/read/2002198



Pour is a pale, clouded yellow with excellent carbonation, a nice head and some lace. Large amount of yeast sediment in the bottom of the bottle that gets transferred to the glass.



Nose is reminiscent of a traditional, British shandy and the tastes reflect that to an extent too. VERY light citrus and a sweetness that you can attribute to the honey. The orange peel comes through less in terms of the taste, and more in terms of a dry, bitterness that one associates with mixed peel.



Soft mouthfeel with the bitterness slightly accentuated in the finish.



Hard to put the glass down on a warm, summer, Atlanta day, I would say the drinkability is very high. Lots of character, and a satisfying, tasty offering from Rogue. Not really a typical Rogue beer by any stretch of the imagination, and in this case, that's a good thing!"

Interesting purchase; $0.99 for this bottle, and $0.99 for the cola and the orange versions , BUT I purchased all three along with a Stone RIS! I was wondering if the purchase would be noticed at the register of Duluth Fine Wines and Beer (I had my doubts), BUT it was! Comments on the ""interesting"" nature of the combo were encouraging; somebody noticed!
Pour is a VERY alarming, bright, lime green, fluorescent (radioactive?) color with very little head and obviously no lace.
Nose is a sweet, lemonade type smell but not very strong.
The tastes are very reminiscent of the kind of shandy that Bass used to put out in cans in the 70's and 80's. These kids soda's were available as soft drinks (and may still be). Very sweet, this is hardly beer but (in ALL seriousness) would be a good way to introduce very young and inexperienced drinkers to alcohol. Essentially this is the beer equivalent of a wine cooler and my wife LOVED it. ""Beer"" for women.
I like the ABV, but I wish it was associated with real beer more often in the US."

Pours with a pale orange body and a pinkish head. Head is quite large initially.
Smell, taste and appearance are basically an orange soda. My wife called it Fanta - period. There is no trace of alcohol and I guess that a child could pick this up and drink the whole bottle thinking that it is just that. I suppose there is a slight dry character in the finish that suggest that is not 100% orange soda, but it's feint to say the least.

Amber body that could pass for a brown ale from a distance.
Of the three (the orange the lemon and the cola) this is the one that is closest to actually being ""beer-like"", but to be honest this is still an abomination.
The head on this is the best of the three but there is still no lace. The head leads to a slightly less soda-like mouthfeel and the taste of cola is less aggressive than the orange and the lemon versions. 
Still very shandy/lemon/Radler like, and is again reminiscent of my days as a kid supping on half-pints of shandy that my dad would buy for me. In that respect I may even drink this again (if it was $0.99 for the bottle or free) since it has a nostalgic edge for me. For those of you who would not get that feeling it's best to avoid this!
Again, not really beer at all and the biggest shame for me about this series is that it gives the low ABV beer a bad name."
Terrapin Beer Company,Terrapin Oak Aged Big Hoppy Monster,,,American Amber / Red Ale,8.50%,on-tap,4.35,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,6/6/2009,"How odd. VERY surprised to see this nonchalantly hanging out at the Duluth Taco Mac early on a Friday afternoon.
Poured into an 11 oz wine glass, the beer sits exactly like the original BHM with a clouded, dubbel like brown color, a small head which ultimately reduces to a white collar and not much life.
To me this doesn't really differ very much at all from the original. I would say there is a subtle touch of vanilla which smooths the beer out a little, but any adjustments that the oak has made to the original are hardly noticeable to me.
Still, large hops and solid malt backbone, I really feel this could almost be the original - perhaps it is!? Good hoppy burps as usual - tasty but one is sufficient for me."
Weyerbacher Brewing Co.,Prophecy,,,Tripel,9.30%,bottle,4.75,4,4.5,5,4,5,6/6/2009,"Interesting to say the least. OK, here's my take;
22 oz bottle that on opening creates a small spew of foamy discharge.
Poured into the Gouden Carolus chalice, the beer has a very deep, rich butterscotch hue, thin film of head that is produced after the aggressive pour that produces the head recedes somewhat.
Nose is soaked in oak but still managaes to remain subtle. A very good sign.
This is what I really want to say about Prophecy;
I am REALLY dissapointed in this as a TRIPEL. The oak overwhelms the subtle Belgian sweetness and yeast that one should expect, and the beer fails horribly on that front. On the other hand...
....the beer is a MASSIVE triumph in terms of oak-aging. Time, after time, after I have been horribly disappointed with American oak-aged beers as the tastes completely overwhelm the palate and wreck the senses on the rocks of the ignorant, the crass, the overbearing, and the non-subtle. Often these beers reject the all too difficult to find tempered ground that American beers of this type throw away with depressingly regularity. This however does a GREAT job in terms of oaking and REALLY hits the spot in terms of subtlety. Surprising and delightful.
Specifics: alcohol is nowhere to be seen, but vanilla and subtle oaks are EVERYWHERE - beautiful.
I'm confused! This is a poor Tripel, but a really great beer; it's an all-to-difficult to find, subtle example of oaking and for that I love it. I guess that in a nutshell it would be better as simply categorized on its own as an ""oak-aged beer"".
Delighted to have gone there. Wow!"

Pour is a hazed, well carbonated mid-orange. The carbonation does not lead to much (if any) head or lace - probably due to the ABV.
Nose is very big on honey but even bigger on the floral, herbal, band-aid medicinal, phenolic notes. Pretty extraordinary!
The strong attributes of the nose are tempered in the taste with honey coming through again but not the other qualities. Some alcohol but absolutely nowhere near 11% - amazing! Obvious comparisons with meads are both valid and understandable.
Finished slightly dry in a champagne like feel/taste.
Very high drinkability when all things are considered."

I REALLY wanted to like this since at 3.9% this kind of beer is just about impossible to find in the US. Unfortunately it was DIRE.
Appearnace was jst the usual, nasty macro, ho head, no lace, watery pour. Again, nose (virtually nothing) was as expected and par for the style/course. Mouthfeel was from the same stable, but again not to disappointing since, (a) it supposed to be somewhat like that, and (b) that was what i was expecting, however the tastes were a different matter. 
Essentially I got a fused, plastic, utterly unfathomable, utterly odd, utterly disgusting combo. about 4 oz was all I could take and down the drain it went. Close to undrinkable, this is one of the very few commercial beers (most BMC products included) that I LITERALLY found impossible to consume. Nasty in the first degree.
Massive shame since I remain devoid of low ABV brews. 3.9% can taste infinitely better than this, and the real travesty is that some people will associate this tripe with low ABV which, as all Englishmen know, is NOT the case."
Southampton Publick House,French Country Christmas Ale (Biere De Garde),,,Bière de Garde,6.60%,bottle,3.95,4,4,4,3.5,4,6/4/2009,"Very different look to the bottle than the current picture in the BA db; this is a regular, 22 oz bomber with significantly different label but it is definitely the same beer (BdG etc.).
Pour is lively with a decent, well formed head. Body has amid-brown pour with some surprisingly lively carbonation.
Nose and tastes reflect a slightly rustic, quite earthy organic note with e earth tones and notes continuing quite strongly through the beer. Plenty of malts without much trace or hint of hop presence, the beer finishes quite sweet.
Very drinkable and definitely has that BdG, farmhouse (NOT funk) edge. A touch grainy and unrefined but at the same time authentic. Another, typically interesting beer from Southampton."
Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery,X-IPA (Extreme),,,American Double / Imperial IPA,8.00%,bottle,4.58,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,6/3/2009,"Big ""ups"" go out to Grant (gford217) for the chance to try this one. Part of my BA March Madness 2009 ""winnings"". 22oz bottle, black wax and my first Flossmoor experience.
On opening there is a small amount of dense gushing. Poured into the Young's 20 oz pint glass, we get a butterscotch orange hazed beer, with that soapy, spotty, large bubbled head that is typical of the style and the ABV. Some nice lace.
Nose is big on resinous hops but they seem to be quite sweet and less aggressive than some in the same style. However, once I get a taste of the beer I am taken back about five or six years ago when I first tasted a ""West Coast style"" DIPA. This style is a fine line for me. There is a suitably appropriate, slightly cloying sweetness BUT it remains manageable. Also we get that sweet sinus clearing grapefruit. Serious alpha aromas and a surprisingly well balanced beer come across the palate and the other sense to make a delicious combo.
Alcohol is very well hidden and the combo yields a very drinkable, delicious example of the style.
As I say, this style walks a fine line for me but this beer really pulls it off incredibly well. For me, perhaps NOT an absolutely quintessential example of the style (it's not as aggressive as some would like, nor is it as bitter as many), but for me it's one of the more accessible and SENSIBLE examples. Restored my faith in the style, nice job Flossmoor."

Twist-off cap yields a strangely colored, orange/pinkish body with a light, fizzy head and some very light lace.
Nose reveals plenty of fruit but it seems a little artificial
Taste is ALL, light blackberry/indistinguishable fruits that lead to a pretty distinct sweetness but it does have a sharpish ending.
If the truth be know if the weather is hot this IS very drinkable and I could imagine chugging a few from the bottle on the beach before moving on to serious beer later in the day.
Sort of Lambic-like without the sourness.

Classic, approachable Gueuze.
Pour is a mid-orange with a fizzy head as a result of an aggressive pour. Good clarity. As expected the head dissipates quickly to leave no lace. Color is sharp.
Nose is a very light, funk with simple green apple notes.
As always the beer reminds me of a easy going, West Country cider with more carbonation than that original.
Tasty, light funk with a very easy and approachable sourness. It has the effect of being a genuine Gueuze with authentic characteristics, but at the same time remains drinkable (in the right context) for the novice. 
Interesting and simple beer that shows off the style in a sensible manner.
Good beer."
The Lost Abbey,10 Commandments,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,9.00%,bottle,4.93,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,5/31/2009,"Well, I'm always holding my breath when I crack open a Lost Abbey these days as I wait to see if the carbonation is going to be an issue. Luckily this open opens with a decent pop, not huge but enough to leave me confident that this beer is carbonated correctly.
750 mL corked & caged with the usual, elaborate LA presentation. Looks classy.
Poured this one into the Gouden Carolus, small chalice. The beer looks near perfect. Beautiful, dark mahogany clarity with a super, rich, dense mocha colored head. Lace is not huge, but some exists. It looks very much like the beer that the glass was made for.
Up front we get the alcohol, honey and the usual rich, dark fruits associated with the style. As those flavors meld, they seem almost quintessential for the style, that is until the finish. At first taste this seems almost like a sour note, but within seconds I can recognize it as the strong herbal characteristics that must come from the rosemary. It's very strong, distinct and delicious and for a few minutes I struggle to place where I have experienced this before. As I get to the end of the glass it comes to me - Cinzano Bianco! For those who are not aware this is an Italian vermouth that is/was infused with herbs such as artemisia (wormwood), cinnamon, cloves, citrus and gentian. This was very popular (at least in England) in the late 70's, but quickly fell out of favor as it became somewhat passe. Anyway...this reminds me of that very much especially in the finish and the aftertaste.
At the end of the bottle there is a touch of funk in the form of a lactose milk sourness that I could really do without, but it really doesn't detract too much, the herbal qualities have won me over.
VERY, very tasty, delicious in fact and as it warms the whole thing comes together beautifully and is extremely satisfying. The alcohol is warming but very well hidden. All in all a fantastic experience, a little faith restored in LA."

Bought this specifically to quench a thirst at the beginning of an Atlanta summer.
Pour is bright with a touch of haze and exhibits a definite, dark golden color. It looks substantial unlike some others in the style.
Nose has a touch of sweetness and some caramel malt presence.
There is a crisp, hoppy bite and some good, sweet malts to compliment it. 
Tasty, simple and quenching, I like this a lot. Not especially complex, but at the same time there is enough going on to take it beyond bland and to keep my attention. A touch of dry character finishes the beer.

This is the 2009 version of the Rejewvenator brewed with ""All Natural Date Concentrate"" and NOT the 2008 fig-based version. It's a new beer.



Pour is a scrumptious, dark orange pour with great clarity and some lively carbonation. The head appears noisily and produces a huge, towering, dense ivory, whipped topping to the beer. Great retention, nice lace.



Nose and tastes have fruits and dark, brown sugars along with some Belgian candy and yeast character. Slightly warming on the way down with a syrupy, rich finish.



It is described on the label as half Doppelbock, half Belgian Dubbel, and although it sounds unlikely, with the dry finish and the fruity and sugary aspects described above, that is not a bad description at all!



Very tasty, and a malt based bomb for sure. Sweet? certainly, but a very interesting beer from a very interesting brewery."
Widmer Brothers Brewing Company,Drop Top Amber,,,American Amber / Red Ale,5.00%,on-tap,2.48,2,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,5/30/2009,"Never really been impressed with Widmer and this isn't the beer that is going to change that feeling.
16oz pour, Taco Mac, Marietta, GA, USA. Appalling bad pour by the barman bringing me a flat beer with zero head. Not ideal, but I am forced to induce the head myself with a straw!
The beer looks incredibly carbonated for the style, and there is a multitude of bubbles rising around the light brown/amber body. Collar of foam is all that's left of the head after a couple of minutes. No lace. looks drab and dead.
A neutral nose and a similar, if slightly sweet caramel based taste. 100% non-offensive, but also 100% forgettable and uninteresting. Body is way too light for me and the tastes are simply ""blah"" for me. Mild sweetness which I like in the style, but it all feels put together in an amateurish manner.
The kind of beer that I would hope that I could manage to brew myself in my basement without too much trouble. Just not very good."
Green Flash Brewing Co.,Green Flash Hop Head Red Ale,,,American Amber / Red Ale,6.40%,bottle,3.83,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,5/28/2009,"12 oz stubbie bottle.
Mid-brown color with some yeast floaties and a well formed, tight, white head. Lace is not as good as the head would suggest, but still OK.
Big hop, resin based nose. Huge. Aggressive.
Not much to report here - not bad, but it's just a big, very hoppy, dry red. Exactly what it says on the label. Some dry grapefruit and other citrus. Big and dry.
A straightforward beer that is going to hit the spot if you are looking for a hoppy red. In that respect, a good beer."
Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),LongShot Double IPA,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,9.60%,bottle,2.03,4,3,1.5,2.5,1.5,5/27/2009,"12 oz bottle as part of the 2009 mixed sixer with the cranberry wit and the traditional bock.
In a nutshell, VERY, VERY disappointed, but at the same time not all that surprised. Once certain beers start getting some momentum and hype it can quickly get out of control and that's what's happened here.
Pour is a solid, bronzed orange body with a lot of haze and really good head. The lace it leaves is solid too. Looks good, but that's the beers' best attribute by a mile.
A somewhat awkward combination of ridiculously unabalnced hops (even considering the style), a MASSIVE and unecessary amount of alcohol, and a really weird, aniseed/medicinal taste. The aftertaste is nasty and the body is cloying.
I actually thought this was ACTUALLY reminiscent of a badly brewed homebrew! Oh wait, it IS!
This is actually un unpleasant beer IMO, with some very off-tatses jumping around on top of a dreadfully unbalanced DIPA. A shambles."
Tröegs Brewing Company,Scratch Beer 12 - 2008,,,American IPA,6.50%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,5/27/2009,"Interesting since this beer ultimately drinks a little more like an English IPA than an American version.
Nice lace form the 12 oz bottle into the 20 oz, Youngs (real) pint glass.
Relatively light and subtle with good, orange color and mild alcohol. There are big floral notes in the nose and tastes for me that accentuate the light touch with the hops and meld weel with the malt backbone. Floral is the lingering memory of this beer.
Ultimately this beer represents a simplier version of the often, over-complicated American version of the style, and seems to take the beer a little more back to its contemporary, English heritage. Very drinkable and extremely refreshing.
I enjoyed this more than I thought that I would, good stuff, not just another over-hyped, over-hopped American IPA. Tasty."

Missed this when it was on draft at The Brick Store in Decatur so this will have to do! It's a hard life! ;-)
Pour is a butterscotch body on top of an impressive (if somewhat light), frothy head. Lace is OK, but not great. Large amount of sediment in the bottom of the bottle, but it does not produce a huge amount of cloudiness - odd.
Nice funk in the nose and the beer is impressively smooth and drinkable. Like all high quality beers of this nature it reminds me very much of a real, English, south-western (Somerset/Devon) cider, and my youth. Tasty, refreshing and moreish, the beer cuts across the palate gently as it warms. Light lemon, lingering tartness and a nice, gentle, maure farmyard/horse blanket finish.
Very impressed, delightfully tasty and a joy to drink BUT at the price I NEED all of those attributes. Those are non-negoitables!
Tasty, but an expensive beer to be honest, and beers that cost a fraction of the price do the job nearly (or just) as well. I still have great respect for this, and I think it is an astonishingly good beer, but the price tag takes the edge off for me a touch. It's strange because this is really a market force issue - I actually think that it IS worth the price, BUT Allagash has a problem since there are several other beers that deliver a similar experience at lower cost."
Lazy Magnolia Brewing Company,Southern Pecan,,,English Brown Ale,4.30%,bottle,3.83,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,5/23/2009,"Thought I would crack this 12 oz bottle in celebration of the FTH, AL bill passing on Friday. Not an AL beer, but you get the idea! Only MS to go!
A little lighter in the body color than I expected. Good, dense, white head and surprising carbonation for the style. A little lively in the mouth for a Brown Ale. Lace is disappointing.
Nose and tastes have the good, nutty, moreish character I was expecting. Malt based (obviously) it drinks above a broken, spotty head.
Nice as a one-off, but the finish seems uncharacteristically bitter for the style. I don't know how many of these I could take.
In the end, just OK, but I enjoyed the ABV."
The Lost Abbey,Lost & Found Abbey Ale,,,Dubbel,8.00%,bottle,3.35,2,4,4,1.5,2.5,5/23/2009,"750 mL corked & caged.
Oh, Oh! Distinct lack of ""pop"" on opening! This IS Lost Abbey - am I gonna be disappointed re: carbonation!?!? Answer comes quickly, and it is ""yes"".
The beer totally ""dies"" in the Terrapin 22 oz snifter. I was expecting the drab color in terms of the pour (that's Dubbel's for ya), but the body, head and lace are DEAD!
It's a HUGE shame since the nose and taste of this brew are really quintessential. Plenty of raisins and figs, set against a slightly dry finish and fruity Belgian yeast. Esters also present, and in terms of the tastes we get a really nice interpretation of the style. Mouthfeel is DREADFULLY disappointing though, and as I say, the beer ""dies"" on the palate.
If Lost Abbey could get a handle on the QC issues they wold be a leading brewery. For now, the jury is out."
Full Sail Brewery & Tasting Room & Pub,LTD Series - 02,,,Maibock / Helles Bock,6.40%,bottle,4.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5/22/2009,"12 oz bottle as a single from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Amber/Red?? I don't think so. Very attractive, deep golden body with a tight, white head and some lace. Carbonation is kept to a minimum, ale style.
Mouthfeel is a little viscous with the alcohol popping through both in the taste and in the slightly slick feel in the mouth. A touch of caramel and definitely some honey.
Some hop bitterness mingles with a fruity backdrop. Some malts come through as well, and there is plenty of sweetness for balance. Drinks quite richly, and there is a definite fruit note that I can't quite put my finger on. Dry finish completes the classy nature of this beer.
VERY tasty (surprisingly so)."
Great Divide Brewing Company,Dunkel Weiss,,,Dunkelweizen,6.40%,bottle,3.93,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,5/22/2009,"22 oz bottle from Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Delighted to see one of my favorite styles produced by a brewer that usually does a very solid job across the board. Bottle sports the usual, new GD artwork and red foil on the neck - nice.
Noisy pour (good sign), and a nice head with lace is produced. A murky, mid-brown pour is the result that is not very attractive but standard for the style.
It's very straightforward in terms of the nose and the taste. We get all the standard clove and banana notes and plenty of sweetness that ends with a touch of bitterness in the finish. Not QUITE there in terms of depth and mouthfeel (a bit light), but outside of that it's a good example of the style.
Drinkable but I would like a little more creamy depth, but outside of that it does a nice job."
Great Divide Brewing Company,Claymore Scotch Ale,,,Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy,7.70%,bottle,3.88,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,5/22/2009,"Had this a few weeks ago on-tap at The Brick Store but this review is for the 12 oz bottle that I bought as a single at Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour is a lot darker than I was anticipating. Getting toward black. Head and lace are ultimately, largely absent.
In terms of the nose and the taste there really isn't much more here than a alcohol inspired malt bomb. Now, one might think that is somewhat one-dimensional, but in the context of the style this just about covers the bases.
The re seems to be a touch of vanilla in there too, but ultimately this hits the spot in a simple, unassuming way and in that respect it works well.
I wouldn't expect too much here, but think within the a style that we don't really see enough of and you'll be quite satisfied."
Magic Hat Brewing Company,Wacko,,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,4.50%,bottle,2.2,1.5,2,2.5,3,1.5,5/22/2009,"Extraordinary, pale pink clear liquid that looks like a few drops of blood have been added to a macro lager.
Carbonation is on the high side with a white head and some lace.
Crisp in the mouth, the beer offers little in the way of taste. VERY macro lager like in terms of vegetal and corn notes. A blind tasting would almost certainly yield a BMC guess.
I think I would even struggle to drink this in the heat of a Georgia summer while grilling on the deck at 110 degrees - that's saying something!
In a nutshell, IMO it's a womans drink/beer that may even ""miss"" with the masses.
I defies logic that Magic Hat would actually put this in bottles and allow it to partially represent their brand. PURE marketing to a certain demographic, I guess. I'm NOT in that group! Down the sink it goes. Very poor indeed."
Victory Brewing Company,Wild Devil,,,Belgian IPA,6.70%,bottle,3.53,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,5/20/2009,"750 mL bottle, corked & caged from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA. Had a hell of a job getting the cork out eventually having to opt for a full-on corkscrew. Given that, the pop and gunsmoke that came with it was a touch disappointing.
Poured this one into the Southampton Weizen glass. Orange/copper body with a touch of darkness. Nicely formed, simply bubbly head, but it's a little light and produces no lace. Steady carbonation is apparent.
Nose has very mild, apple based Brett funk, but it's pretty reserved.
It's much sweeter than I was anticipating. Obviously there is some mild funk in there, but to be honest the IPA notes continue to come through strongly. As the beer drinks and warms, it becomes increasingly IPA like with grapefruit mixing in amongst the mild funk.
Not sure about this, it comes up a bit short, falls between two stools and really ends up being a bit of a novelty gone wrong. It's as if Victory are trying to be a little too clever. No point in messing around with Hop Devil really."
Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),Samuel Adams Imperial Stout,,,Russian Imperial Stout,9.20%,bottle,4.13,3.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,5/18/2009,"$2.99 for the 12 oz bottle from Total Wine, Perimeter, Atlanta, GA, USA.
This one goes into the Terrapin 22 oz snifter in small portions. I want to let this one warm over an extended period. Standard, black opaque beer with a thinnish, dark tan spotty head and a small collar.
Light solvent alcohol in the nose but with some sweetness.
The tastes are really quite light too, and definitely sit on the side of milk chocolate rather than dark. It's not really very aggressive at all and it reminds me more of an alcoholic porter. Very creamy and well rounded. Mouthfeel is perhaps the best feature of this brew. There is a little more alcohol and dark raisin-like character in the back end but to be honest this is very approachable.
Nowhere near as potent as some in the style, and the beer drinks easily. Very unusual for me that I could imagine myself drinking more than one of these in a session. 
Milk chocolte is the overwhelming feeling here."
Alaskan Brewing Co.,Alaskan Amber,,,Altbier,5.30%,bottle,4.48,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5/17/2009,"12 oz stubbie bottle.
Been waiting on this one for a while, delighted to get the chance to try it.
In a nutshell this beer is, for me, just about as quintessential as one is likely to get outside of Dusseldorf.
Magnificent clarity underneath the bone white head and superb lace and just the right amount of carbonation to make the beer feel alive but not enough to make it prickly. There is a definite reddish/orange hue to the beer that mingles with the more classic, brown colors.
The classic stamp of an Alt is always the malt balance. The malts a beautifully balanced her and they offer a light, nutty refreshing quality that is unusual in many American made beers. Definitely crafted with a subtle touch.
Drinkability for me was huge, with the bottle gone in just a few minutes. Very smooth, moreish and satisfying, a very, very nice beer."
Flying Fish Brewing Company,Exit 4,,,Tripel,9.70%,bottle,3.2,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,5/17/2009,"Red plastic covers the capped, 750 mL bottle. On opening there is a touch of gunsmoke but not much other signs of life. The words ""American Trippel"" on the label. I'm not keen on the spelling, nor on the word American coupled with the word Trippel - it has me worried, and as it turns out with very good reason.
Pour is a promising, orange hazed affair with better head and lace than I initially thought I was going to see.
Nose gives gentle citrus in the form of grapefruit and not much else.
Tastes reflect the nose but with a pretty healthy dose of pepper along with the grapefruit, and a fairly harsh, dry, bitter ending. There is not a hint of sweetness which for me means that this is NOT a Tripel by any stretch of the imagination. Belgian IPA perhaps, but the preponderance of hops mean this beer seems well-entrenched on the American side of things rather than the Belgian.
As it warms more floral notes come through.
It's not a bad beer, and I quite enjoyed it, BUT I was mildly disappointed because this is in no way a Tripel. The sweetness and the Belgian yeast character is largely missing for me. I wanted to like it much more since I wanted far more Belgian character. A Tripel ought to be a Tripel in my book, and this ain't one."
Tröegs Brewing Company,Tröegs Sunshine Pils,,,German Pilsener,5.30%,bottle,3.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,5/15/2009,"Quite surprised that I haven't reviewed this before now.
12 oz bottle.
Pour is classically clear and carbonated with great, golden color. Head is not hue, nor is it well retained or does it leave much lace.
Initial Saaz bitterness is surprisingly early in the mouth rather than later as I would usually expect for the style. The beer drinks very cleanly which is obviously good, but to the point of almost being slightly bland. The best I can do is describe it as neutral.
I dunno, this looks nice and is promising but ultimately it comes up a little short on all fronts. Still tasty and nice but it just leaves me wanting a touch more."
Søgaards Bryghus,Julebuk,,,Bock,6.30%,bottle,4.38,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,5/13/2009,"Another one of the Scandanavian imports. This one came from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA. $11.99 I *think* for the 500 mL bottle, so definitely on the pricey side of things.
A very nice, deep mahogany pour that would would expect for a beer that is categorized as a Bock. Seems well carbonated and it produces some darkish, tan colored head to boot. Quite a noisy pour and some depth to the mouthfeel. Creamy feel.
Nose and tastes reveal a heady mixture of musty malts, spices and a winter warmer note. The spices seem to be hop based and there is a real combo of dark fruits and bitterness that come together nicely.
I'm not sure that this is really a traditional bock as such, in fact along with the name it would seem much better suited to be called a winterwarmer, BUT nevertheless it has some nice depth of flavor and feel and it even warms a little on the back end. A nice malt based aftertaste too.
Impressed, but too expensive for me to drink with any kind of regularity."
Smuttynose Brewing Company,Smuttynose Maibock (Big Beer Series),,,Maibock / Helles Bock,8.70%,bottle,4.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,5/12/2009,"22 oz bottle from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA a couple of weeks ago. Bottle conditioned in 2009; notched on the label.
Pour is a quite distinct yellow, golden affair with some big, frothy head. Not a huge amount of lace but this is probably at least a small function of the ABV. It looks great in the Tucher Weizen, 500 mL glass - then again most beers do!
Nose and tastes are surprisingly sweet with a hoppy back-end. I get some pineapple and other tropical fruits and this reminds me a little of a Tripel. Very tasty, and a delightful lager. It's great to get a quality lager on the scene.
The tastes have some alcohol but it is very much under control. I get some honey and other residual sweetness in there too. 
Extremely drinkable at the end of a long day as it provides a quick alcohol kick too."
Butte Creek Brewing Company,Helltown Organic Hefeweizen,,,Hefeweizen,5.00%,bottle,2,2,2.5,2,2,1.5,5/9/2009,"22oz bottle from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour gives a lemon/butterscotch color with a disappointing head, disappointing lace and pretty much no retention. Just not good enough for the style. The pour also lacks any body or depth of color mainly because the requisite swirling to collect the yeasties at the bottom of the bottle yields nothing!
A light acid in the aroma but the failure of this beer is in the taste. It is AMAZINGLY watery and lacks any organic, hay/grass note as well. Impact = zero. It quite literally feels, tastes and drinks like a watered down Hefe. Not offensive in any way, but dreadfully shallow.
A pretty poor beer in terms of the color, appearance, nose taste and character. I'd say avoid this and purchase one of the scores of better Wit's of Hefe's out there."
Great Divide Brewing Company,Belgica,,,Belgian IPA,7.20%,on-tap,4.13,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,5/9/2009,"16 oz pint on tap at The Porter, Little Five Points, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Golden body with a little chill haze underneath a pillow-like, rocky head. Good creamy peaks and troughs in the head. Noce retention and lace.
Nose has the pre-requisite light fruit and IPA notes. The Belgian yeasts and sweetness are simple and subtle rather than massive, and the same is true of the hoppy notes. The bitterness and hop character only really cut in in the aftertaste, and the combo makes this very drinkable.
I really enjoyed this beer for a couple of reasons. Firstly it was understated. I am SO tired of huge, massive, uncomprimising flavors in American brews. Secondly I feel this is true to style. Thirdly it's well made and revels in its own simplicity."
Terrapin Beer Company,Terrapin Thirty Strong,,,American Strong Ale,8.80%,on-tap,3.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,5/9/2009,"Brewed especially for Taco Mac to celebrate 30 years of their existence, this beer is made with 30 ingredients! I understand that Spike calls this ""kitchen sink"" brewing! 16 oz pint sampled on the day of release at Taco Mac, Perimeter, Atlanta, GA, USA $6.96 for the pint!



Hazed, amber appearance this has a Dubbel like murky brown apperance. 



Head is not large, but it does give some really nice, sticky lace.



Nose is a fruity (pineapple), bubblegum and alcohol mix and this finds it's way into the taste. The bubblegum is very strong in the taste as is the booze. It drinks all the way up there at 8-9%.



Drinks with plenty of Dubbel/Tripel like fruit, but the finish brings the hops and this beer goes from some estery Belgian character up front to a solid American Strong Ale in the back end. Interesting combo I suppose, but this is not really my cup of tea and a beer that, like many of its style, tries to do too much. It's a little busy and it does reflect the multitude of ingredients.



One is plenty for me before the palate starts getting a touch weary.



I dunno, bit of a novelty I suppose but ultimately it's just another huge beer with too much going on as far as I'm concerned."

===DISCLAIMER===
OK, right off the top this *could* be an infected bottle so this review is written in that context. Re-reviews to follow when more data is gathered but for now I want to record my thoughts at this stage. Take it or leave it, but it would be interesting to see if anyone has had a similar experience.
===
VERY disappointing lack of pop on opening. Clearly there is a carbonation issue here, but as we all know, LA has had its fair share of issues with this.
Carbonation is simply not there. The body is an orange, murky affair that doesn't strike me as anything like a classic, BSPA. No head and lace obviously.
The nose has some orange marmalade and mild funk. This carries through to the taste where there is a complicated mix of light funk, sourness, alcohol, fruit and bitterness. It's interesting to me, because although it is miles away from a classic Belgian Pale, it does sort of produce an interesting combination of woody, cider infection and a touch of funk.
The cider-woody, apple-cider notes are typical of an infected beer, but paradoxically the drinkability of the beer still stays reasonable.
I dunno, my suspicions are aroused simply because of LA's issues with carbonation but maybe this is what they intended! It's difficult to know."
Rogue Brewery (Brewer's on the Bay),Smoke Ale,,,Smoked Beer,6.00%,bottle,3,3,3,3,3,3,5/8/2009,"22 oz, screen printed bottle. Usual Rogue presentation.
Cloudy orange pour with a high head which is wispy and quickly dissipates. some scant lace. The orange color and the head makes it look a little like an American IPA.
Pretty reserved smoke in the nose, and to be honest it seems just as reserved in the taste. In NO way would I characterize this as a smoked beer since it really just drinks like a typically unbalanced Rogue (large hop presence without much malt to back it up) with smoke notes added.
It seems to have some diacetyl in the finish too.
Pretty unimpressed all around. If you are looking for a genuine Rauchbier I wouldn't be looking here; if, on the other hand you want to drink a typical Rogue beer that has a bit of smoke character then you'll be pleased. For me, no thanks."

Pour is vivid, golden yellow with no sustainable head but some wispy lace left on the glass.
As far as I can tell there is no aroma.
Light metal bitterness that smooths out pretty quickly to give a sweet middle and ending. The sweetness remains evident in the aftertaste. Alcohol tastes breaks over the rear of the tongue to give a dry final touch late.
Inoffensive is the best way to describe it but that's as far as I can go."

Typical bright yellow urine appearance with low carbonation, no head, no lace and (again) as far as I can tell, no aroma.
Apart from a very slight dry bitterness in the very back of the beer, there is almost nothing here. Finish and aftertaste are dry and characterless.

Small, Wellington style glass pour, perhaps eight ounce.
Golden hazed body, on the lighter side of things in terms of the shade. Small head, but it produces plenty of sticky lace with some decent retention.
Great light floral, hoppy nose with a sweetness in the nostrils.
Exactly the same in the taste. Super hoppy burps, but a real light touch (for a change) from an American DIPA. NO huge ""smack-you-round-the-face"" west coast notes here, rather this is a floral based beer but still with an emphasis on some syrup based, lightly cloying sweetness. Sweetened grapefruit certainly but with honey-lemon undertones. It reminds me a little of some of the taste associated with my first Houblon Chouffe with that Tripel sweetness in there somewhere.
This is one of those beers that I bet is difficult to make. It flirts (successfully) with bigger things but still manages to achieve a degree of subtlety and class - not a combo that one finds too often in American beers period, and even less likely in a beer that is categorized as an American DIPA.
The finish is a sweet, gentle hop extravaganza, but again with careful, subtle undertones.
Very tasty and an unusually well-crafted beer especially in this category."
Southampton Publick House,Southampton Cuvee Des Fleurs,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,8.20%,bottle,3.95,4,4,4,3.5,4,5/5/2009,"Decent pop on opening the corked & caged 750 mL bottle. No gun smoke and not much carbonation.
Pour is a mid-orange that lacks much head unless the pour is pretty agressive. Seems a touch under-carbonated to me. No lace.
Aroma is, errr....floral! No surprises there, then.
Tastes are floral yes, but ultimately it plays out as a floral based, sweetened grapefruit. It reminds me of a Dandelion & Burdock, which again is hardly a huge surprise BUT is an enormously nostalgic moment for the English amongst us. Simple, syrupy sweet mouthfeel and a satisfying alcholic taste. The alcohol is more of a taste rather than a presence, but it is noticeable.
As anticipated, although I really enjoyed the drinkability and the light nature of this beer, it DOES get a little tiring by the end of the bottle. I'm not sure that this is a criticism though, since I was anticipating the floral note to be a little grating at the end of the large bottle. Not an easy thing to consume a lot of, but it just about holds it together for the duration of the 750.
Enjoyable and tasty, definitely recommend some of this if you can get it, but one bottle may be enough."
Guinness Ltd.,Guinness 250th Anniversary Stout,,,Irish Dry Stout,5.00%,on-tap,3.35,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,5/3/2009,"$5.00 for the pint at Taco Mac in Douglasville, GA, USA.
Maybe a difficult beer to give an objective shake to, given that ""normal"" Guinness is the inevitable reference point.
Pour was jet black but with a much smaller, wispier head than ""regular"" Guinness. The head looked whiter too. Retention and lace were both poor. Lacked much reverse surge.
Much less smooth than regular Guinness and it lacked any kind of silky mouthfeel.
Many more bitter notes than I was expecting as well. Thinner feel overall and a bit of a disappointment to me. The beer seemed to give a edgier feel than I was expecting and an increased level of tannins and dark roasted notes. Certainly hoppier than the regular pint.
A little unbalanced I thought, with an emphasis on bitter, chocolate and charcoal notes. Surprisingly aggressive and a little drier than I was anticipating.
Not sure what the point of this is, but there you go."
Great Divide Brewing Company,Colette Farmhouse Ale,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,7.30%,bottle,2.95,3,2.5,3,3.5,3,5/2/2009,"Review #1900.
Somewhat surprised to come across this at Arbor Place Beverage, Douglasville, GA, USA. $7.99 for th 22 oz, gold foiled bottle with the new style Great Divide label. Bottled on April 15th 2009.
Poured into the Southampton Weizen glass the beer produces a pretty decent head. It lacks much creamy density but it is well formed (if light) but does not produce much lace. The body is a surprisingly thin, bright yellow macro-like pour but has some cloudy presence.
Nose has some acidity and some light funk/lemon.
Tastes are quite like an adjunct lager! It isn't until the finish that we get some greater acidity and more funk. A dry finish builds from the middle of the beer and reaches a crescendo in the back of the beer. Quite a lot of unbalanced bitterness.
Mouthfeel has a creamy nature which pulls it briefly away from the macro-lager situation that some of the other characteristics seem to have built.
WOW - odd. I'm not sure what the Great Divide boys have really achieved here. It's a bit like a lemony macro lager! I'm genuine surprised at how poor this seems to be in some aspects for the style. Another visit maybe? By GD's standards, not a very good beer."

Took my own regular advice and paired this with a decent curry from The Viceroy. Despte some pretentious suggestions about IPA's and the like being paired with curry, after years and years of drinking beer with curry, I fail to find a better combo of the cheap, macro adjunct lager and a great Ruby.
Appearance is as expected with a golden clarity, well carbonated body and the usual short-lived, wispy head that fades to not much. There was a touch of lace.
The usual adjunct lack of araoma, and bland, vgetal notes but all in all for the job it was asked to do it was perfect. Tastes are well, not really there, but it pairs well and offers a refreshing cut across the dense spice.
Hopeless in many other situations, this type of beer is perfect in this one."
McAuslan Brewing,St-Ambroise Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),5.00%,bottle,3.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,5/1/2009,"$2.75 from Green's on Buford as a single in the 11.5 oz bottle.
Darkish golden pour with some decent, pure white head and lace. 
Some decent complexity in the taste with an odd combo of a refreshing lager like characteristics, but also a strangely sharp, bitter grapefruit ending and aftertaste. The sharp, tart grapefruit notes caught me by surprise as I was not expecting them. They were tasty and enjoyable but just not what I had in mind. A few earthy notes which unfortunately lend a bit of a musty/old taste to the brew.
Much more bitter (and tasty) than your average pale ale, and it had th hop twang of a Saaz based Pils or perhaps even a very light IPA. The body, tastes and overall feel was very light but the taste packed a punch that punched well above its weight. Interesting and drinks nicely."
New Belgium Brewing,2° Below Winter Ale,,,Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB),6.60%,bottle,3.73,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,5/1/2009,"12 oz bottle.
Bottle with ridge on the neck reminiscent of the Westy 12 bottle.
The appearance was a somewhat pedestrian, light amber but cloudy body, but the head and lace were very good. Some nice layered lace. A little light and clouded on the color but otherwise nice.
Nose and tastes are a satisfying combo of biscuit malts and a quite dry, bitter finish. I wouldn't necessarily describe this an ESB that I would get terribly excited about, but what I would say is that this is an ESB that does remind me of some of the better, English style equivalents.
Quite tasty and as it warms it gets more fruit. Some grapefruit and a touch of citrus peel.
Interesting and tasty beer."
Shipyard Brewing Co.,Shipyard Imperial Porter (Pugsley's Signature Series),,,Baltic Porter,7.10%,bottle,3.85,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,4/26/2009,"22 oz bottle that was purchased at Tower on Piedmont. Gold foiled neck and one of those thicker, higher quality labels that wraps the whole bottle. May have been $7.99. I've passed on this one a few times, decided to take the plunge a couple of weeks ago.
Went for an unconvential glass and put this one into the Tucher Weizen 500 mL - all beers look great in that glass.
Pour is black - I mean black! A few red highlishts at the extreme edges, but barely there.
Head is minimal, but it fades to a nice, 1/8 of an inch layer on the beer which is persistent and creamy. Almost no lace. 
The beer has some, licorice, dark notes and a touch of roastiness but all in all it's rather light. The word ""Imperial"" is a little misplaced here. Some light soap present as well.
If you are looking for a deep, high alcohol, massive, Imperial Porter then you are going to be disappointed. If like me, you enjoy tasty beers that are more managable and drinkable then this ""Imperial"" beer will be a refreshing and very drinkable change. The body is also light for the style, but again this adds to the drinkability for me.
I bet a lot of people will be disappointed in this beer, but not me. Good, simplier than expected, stuff."
The Lost Abbey,Inferno Ale,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,8.50%,bottle,4.18,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,4/26/2009,"750 mL corked & caged bottle. Not much pop on opening.
Poured into the Duvel tulip (seemed like the most natural glass) it forms a lovely, whipped ice-cream head with nice lace on top of a golden body - very Duvel like!
Nose is classical - Belgian yeasts, light sugars, alcohol, a touch of pepper and all the esters that you would expect.
Tastes replicate the nose and the tastes, BUT it's drier, a tad warmer (in terms of alcohol), a touch more bitter and a touch less fruity than the nose suggested. Nice marmalade, citrus bitterness in the finish and the aftertaste. I prefer something a touch sweeter, but for me it's still a very nice beer just don't expect a lot of sweet character.
Easy drinking and it basically boils down to a very nice BSPA. Not perfect, but classic in many respects so depending on price and mood, I might reach for it again."
Victory Brewing Company,St. Victorious,,,Doppelbock,8.50%,bottle,3.83,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,4/26/2009,"One of my favorite styles from a solid brewer. Despite Victory having been in GA for sometime now, we've never had any of this. 
12 oz bottle as part of my Secret Bunny package, thanks mday. Best Before Dec 2 09 printed on the label.
Poured into the DFH palm glass, the tan head is disappointing in terms of retention and lace, but at the same time not that surprising considering the ABV. The carbonation seems especially low on this one.
Nice garnet pour with good clarity. 
Very simple malty notes dominate but I get a lot of blackberry in the taste. It lacks the classic, marzipan depth but it retains the tastiness. Surprisingly light drinking in terms of the taste, and the alcohol seems well hidden in most of the drink. The ending does impact some more heat but I am surprised at the general lack of anything really big.
Not as deep in terms of malt compared to what I was expecting, but at the same time it still drinks well. A bit of a fruitier/lighter Doppelbock than usual, but still a nice beer."
Brasserie de Silly S.A.,Scotch Silly,,,Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy,8.00%,bottle,3.03,2.5,3,3,2.5,3.5,4/25/2009,"$10 for the 750 mL corked and caged, black foiled bottle from Bruisin' Ales in Asheville, NC, USA.
Pops open with a small amount of brownish foam. This one is poured into the L'Abbaye Brasserie des Rocs chalice.
The head is small a slightly disappointing especially considering the foamy nature of the bottle opening. The body is a little drab too - a murky brown that lacks much excitement or life.
This is a strange brew that ultimately misses for me. It seems to get caught between two stools with the fruity, dark Belgian notes being present, but they also sit awkwardly with the malty sweet, mildly smoky peat notes of the Scotch Ale. Both sets of attributes ARE there, but I think the Belgian yeast sits awkwardly with this style. This is a common problem when melding Belgian yeast character with non-Belgian styles.
The mouthfeel is also rather thin.
I was disappointed because the malty side of things is one I generally favor and I absolutely love a good Belgian Dark, but this didn't come together well and so it was a miss for me. It's a shame."
Brasserie Dieu Du Ciel,Rosée D'hibiscus,,,Herbed / Spiced Beer,5.00%,bottle,3.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4/25/2009,"A slightly pinkish orange pour that gives he impression of a squeezed blood red grapefruit. A little murky. The head has a similarly light pink tinge. Head is short lived and there is not much lace to speak of.
Aroma and tastes are fruit based rather than the floral one that I was half expecting.
The taste is mainly a light, sweet and sour almost like a sweetened Cantillon beer but nowhere near as sweetened as a say, a Lindemans lambic. Low carbonation and an acidic finish. Dryish too.
Pretty easy drinking for the summer, but this is a novelty beer for me and will hold no place in any kind of regular rotation for me."
Brouwerij Van Steenberge N.V.,Cherish Kriek Lambic,,,Lambic - Fruit,5.00%,bottle,4.33,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,4/25/2009,"$3.00 for the 8.4 oz bottle from Bruisin' Ales, Asheville, NC, USA.
This one is poured into the Gouden Carolus small chalice.
Appearance is pretty much as expected. A light brown, slightly reddish body with some nice, simple head and some decent lace.
Nose is a simple, understated cherry with a promise of sweetness.
Tastes are a delightful sweet and sour combo. As with many fruit based lambics the sweetness comes first and then the sour kicks in at the back end. Deep cherry notes are interspersed between fine carbonation. There's a touch of bicarbonate in the background.
Tasty and highly drinkable. ABV adds to the drinkability and appeal."
Old Dominion Brewing Co.,Old Dominion Spring Buck,,,Belgian Pale Ale,7.80%,bottle,3.7,4,4,4,3,3,4/25/2009,"12 oz single from Total Wine on Barrett Parkway, Kennesaw, GA, USA.
Poured into the Sweetwater Pils glass, the beer pours a noticeable yellow color and looks quite viscous. There seems to be a highish level of carbonation too. Head is creamy, dense and provides some nice lace.
Very prominent orange and honey notes in the nose and taste. I get quite a syrupy mouthfeel which for me is at odds with the light taste of the beer and it all sits a little oddly. It's strange because the alcohol is not present overtly in the taste, but it is in the mouthfeel.
The beer is very sweet and thick and drinks every part of its 7.5% for me. I don't really get how in t fits into the style, in fact I don't think that it does at all, but there you go.
The drinkability is an odd thing; I thought it would be high but it turned out that the combination of style the mismatch and the high, syrup presence that it is not. Strange."
Green Flash Brewing Co.,Green Flash Le Freak,,,Belgian IPA,9.20%,bottle,3.58,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,4/24/2009,"$9.50 from Bruisin' Ales, Asheville, NC, USA for the 22oz bottle.
Pour is interesting since it provides a light, yellow, tripel colored body with some slight haze. It is also surprisingly good in the head department with decent retention and some nice lace - surprising because of the high ABV. On subsequent pours the head is bubbly and very high. 
Nose has light alcohol, light pepper and some spice.
Well, I guess that this is pretty true to style. Plenty of hop bitterness against the background of seriously peppery sweetness. Bitterness lingers and the finish is VERY dry. 
Some slick, syrupy, viscous mouthfeel which I guess is fine, but to be honest the beer would be fine without. This could easily go down a couple of percentage points and it would still work and drink nicely. As it is, this is a beer that needs to be consumed in small amounts and the drinkability is not great for me."
George Bateman and Son Ltd. / Batemans Brewery,Batemans XXXB,,,Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB),4.80%,bottle,3.8,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,4/23/2009,"500 mL bottle from Bruisin' Ales on a recent haul. $5.50 for the bottle. 23 SEP 09 dot matrixed on the neck along with 8206 207A.
Light, orange amber pour with a thin, wispy, ivory head. Little lace, but this is probably due to the temperature of the beer. Nice, simple, appropriate and light carbonation.
Surprisingly sweet nose but there is more of the standard biscuit malts and crisp bitterness in the body of the beer than the aroma would suggest. Light, unsweetened grapefruit along with some citrus orange character.
Aftertaste seems particularly strong with a metallic bitterness and some surprising hop presence.
Interesting beer that steps slightly outside of the ESB category for me in terms of the bitterness. Slightly drier than usual and malts seemed less prominent and less rounded. A little harsh for the style perhaps?
Despite all of that it drinks easily and if the price were better I'd be drinking a lot more of this."
Hook Norton Brewery Co. Ltd.,Hooky  Bitter,,,English Bitter,3.60%,bottle,4.2,2.5,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,4/19/2009,"$5.00 for the 500 mL bottle from Bruisin' Ales, Asheville, NC, USA.
The pour is WAY TOO light for my liking. I'm alarmed by the golden color that competes with the word ""Bitter"" on the label. NOT my idea of the look of an English Bitter at all, but maybe times have changes somewhat and the advent of the English, ""Golden Ale"" seems to be permeating all kinds of areas that I never thought it would.
Outside of the appearance I get a whole load of things that seem more familiar to me.
Light, biscuit malts and fruit in the nose which are replicated in the taste. It drinks simply and easily and the ABV is a treat. Unfortunately my extensive cask experience in the UK means that I am constantly disappointed but bottle versions of this type of brew. It's NOT he same as drinking this on cask in Oxford!
Anyway, back to the matter in question. Ultimately it drinks very easily and the simple fruit and malt notes come together to make this a tasty if somewhat sterile experience. WHERE'S MY CASK!?!?! :-(("
New Belgium Brewing,Lips Of Faith Dark Kriek,,,American Wild Ale,8.00%,bottle,4.33,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,4/19/2009,"Thanks go out to my 2009 Secret Bunny, mday.
22 oz, screen printed bottle.
Poured into the Duvel tulip, this beer has an appearance that leans more toward the wood than the cherry side of things. Dark and very rich garnet color, perhaps closer to brown, with a head that is only provoked by aggressive swirling. Having done that, the head is quite creamy but still short-lived. Minimal lace but I wasn't expecting much.
Nose gives up some malt and a touch of tartness but not much else. As it warms, fruit cuts in a little more.
I'd agree with many of the other reviewers here that there is a sweet/sour note with the emphasis on sweet first followed by sour. The dry character of authentic cherries also comes through quite strong. A touch of wood, but it is muted. Finishes with light dry notes but it is NOT aggressive or pronounced.
I like this beer since the wood is reserved and the cherries give a decent amount of sweetness, color and fruitiness without the beer ever getting ""sweet"" as such. A fine balance is struck across the board, and New Belgium has produced a beer with a very light touch BUT with serious note associated with it. VERY pleased with this beer since it straddles a couple of difficult taste/style combos very well. Not an easy beer to pull off but this does it."
Pisgah Brewing Co.,Pisgah American Style Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),5.50%,bottle,3.73,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4/19/2009,"22 oz bomber purchased at the brewery.
Into the Terrapin snifter it goes. Pour is a turbid, browm murky one with a very large, rocky head. Retention and lace are both good.
Very organic feel about this beer with elements of grassy hay, green hops and freshly mown fields. In that respect the color is darker than I was expecting. Hops to the front as is the way with the American version of the style.
Crisp, easy drinking and refreshing, I found the beer a touch dry but in the grand scheme of things still very enjoyable."
Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),Samuel Adams Blackberry Witbier,,,Witbier,5.50%,bottle,3.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4/18/2009,"12 oz single from Tower on Buford.
Pretty much exactly as expected.
Pour is a clear, golden hue with a decent head and some lace. Carbonation levels are appropriate and good.
The beer basically looks like, acts like and feels like a simple, well put together lager. There are simple crisp notes that make it very drinkable, and a hint of fruit in amongst the malt and hop balance. Drinks VERY easily and is tailor made for summer drinking in the south. It doesn't fel or drink much like a traditional Wit at all, so if you're looking for that, search elsewhere.
Obviously a lot of crossover potenial and plenty of potential for pairing with simple, grilled fare and other light food.
Very little to report here. This is a relatively well made beer that will appeal to the masses in the warmer months. It's not a beer that many geeks will either have much time for, or perhaps even give much credit to, but if you take it for what it is (and no more), you'll appreciate the beer for its own (limited) attributes.
Take a sixer to a summer gathering and it might provoke a conversation, and it's something that your wife may get into. Outside of that, nothing much to report."

Well, you get what it says on the label!
Pour is a slightly clouded, bright orange body with some minimal head and lace.
Nose is big on the peach/fruit side of things but also seems to me to have a white chocolate note. The Peach and Wheat attributes come through in the tastes but to a lesser extent than the nose would initially suggest. not much else to report here.
A beer that acts well as a thirst quencher, but to be honest strikes me as ""one for the ladies"". it lacks much depth and after about 1/2 of the pint I've had enough of the fruit and I'm looking to move on.
Obvious summer quaffing potential for the masses, but not a beer that will interest me much at all after this visit. As far as I am concerned a novelty brew."

Into the Youngs (Imperial) pint glass.
Reading the bottle and knowing what I know about English beer, I am immediately suspicious of this brew for a least one reason. The name worries me since I'm expecting that this one of the relatively new (last 5 years) breed of British ""Golden Ales"" that have popped up. As far as I can tell, the new ""Golden Ale"" in the UK is basically a dumbed down English Pale/Bitter that is designed to appeal to the masses. My experiece with them has been very mixed, so putting this in a bottle as opposed to a cask has me even more worried.
The pour is a clouded tangerine with some soapy head but minimal lace.
The nose has a touch of hops, but it is muted. Some light fruit too - citrus based but not especially specific, perhaps some mixed peel?
Very nice sweetened grapefruit tastes. It's definitely grapefruit based and get increasingly bitter with warmth. Very refreshing and a decent hop bite at the end.
Extremely drinkable and a beer that I enjoyed a LOT more than I was expecting. Delightful ABV helps the consumption. Tasty."

Sat at the bar next to a Texas resident who tried to persuade me not to order this, but even though I listened carefully to his arguments I felt I had a duty to see for myself.
As it turned out, his description of the beer as, ""not bad, but not a very good Doppelbock"" was pretty accurate.
Pour was a standard dark, chestnut color but the head and lace are both WOREFULLY disappointing. This is at least in part to the pathetic way the beer was poured, but also a sign of things to come with the brew.
In a nutshell what we have here is a flimsy Dopplebock. Watery in terms of its body, presence and taste, a Dopplebock for the masses perhaps? It lacks any chewy, large malt character and watery (at least for the style) is what continually comes to mind.
Some caramel presence, some sugary notes, some malt depth and some allcohol bite but ultimately it's a day late and a dollar short.
Shame really, as a opportunity seems to have gone begging."

Chestnut colored pour with a nice head that falls back to give some nice lace and a film and ring of froth that lingers.
Nose gives away very little other than some simple malts and a touch of indistinguishable spice.
Mouthfeel is good, with a decent amount of creaminess.
The tastes are slightly on the bitter side of spice things and the beer is a touch edgy and not all that well rounded. Sweet malts support it quite well, but it needs something to smooth it out.
Close but no cigar from Weyerbacher on this one."

Poured into the Southampton Weizen glass, the beer is much darker than I was expecting. Dark golden. Very fine carbonation, not much of it but it is consistent. Better than expected for a 9.00% beer. Dark gold, a touch of lace and some creamy, small head.
HUGE, HUGE bubble-gum nose. Not sure if I like it, because the alcohol that's in there starts to take on a very astringent, solvent like note against the background of the gum.
Viscous body (as expected) and the bubble gum and pear drop notes come through. It's alcohol soaked (again as expected) but it doesn't seem to meld all that well.
I dunno, I was really looking forward to this, but it's just too hot and more importantly, solvent like. It burns a little. Seems unbalanced in terms of the alcohol and perhaps a beer that could have been produced at 7.5% instead and would still have achieved the same effect and been a better beer."
Brouwerij Van Steenberge N.V.,Piraat Ale,,,Belgian IPA,10.50%,bottle,4.65,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,4/14/2009,"Having drunk this several times before, I decided it was time to write a review.
There are no surprises here, this is simply a high powered, high quality Belgian Pale. Nothing else to report.
Amazingly attractive body, a perfect golden orange color and although the head is neither massively rocky, nor huge, it has great retention, and the little lacing it leaves is really solid.
Massive alcohol and esters are there all the way through. The classic Belgian yeasts are supremely evident and I feel that this is simply a standard for the style. Lots of pear, pineapple and other fruits this is a dangerous combination of alcohol and drikability.
Body remains satisfying all the way through - a truly GREAT beer."

Wit's are an intriguing style for me because a really well made one is a beer that I enjoy, but at the same time I feel that they have the potential to be a bit of a let down. Their success largely hinges upon their mouthfeel for me, and the biggest crime that one can encounter is a Wit which is watery and lacking in body. Unfortunately this was one of those.
The pour led to the standard appearance but it lacked much life. This is another problem when dealing with Wit's because this has the potential to make the beer look uninspiring at best and like dirty dishwater at worst. Standard, clouded yellow color but the head and lace were both disappoining.
The mouthfeel is where this one really fails - simply put it lacks any depth. That is where the beer falls down and never recovers. Bland and lacks any citrus intensiy and presence.
Mild spice notes are present, as are some Belgian yeasts, but the whole thing is so flimsy and fragile in its construction it never takes off for me. Feesl limp in terms of the intensity and the clove and other spice elements just don't come together at all.
Many other better Wit's out there IMO, EVEN American ones!"

Lively looking, amber body with an off-white head and some decent lace despite relatively little retention. Looks solid, with good clarity.
Nose is malty with a touch of infused, sweet fruit that is not necessarily that of raspberries but does have a ester based whiff.
Tastes are much the same in terms of the indistinguishable fruit (although I suppose that here I might guess raspberry) and the same malts that are recorded in the nose. The beer is very drinkable and simple, and feels like a sweet brown ale to me.
Tasty brew that was very simple and easy to drink. Take it down 1.5-2.0% in terms of ABV and perhaps I could session a few of these, until then it's a one-off.
Enjoyable, but not something I'm likely to put into a regular rotation."
Hook Norton Brewery Co. Ltd.,Old Hooky,,,English Brown Ale,4.60%,bottle,4.85,4,4.5,5,5,5,4/11/2009,"Absolutely delighted to come across this 500 mL bottle at Bruisn' Ales in Asheville, NC, USA. $5.00. Tall thin brown bottle in the USA, NOT as shown in the BA database.
In my opinion this is incorrectly categorized as a English Brown Ale - it simply isn't. This is a classic English, ESB in my book.
Body is light and produces a small head with little lace. English Pale Ale color. Majestic bottle. Hell Yeah!
Nose and tastes are incredibly fruity with tremendous presence. The malt nose is bigger than the taste and in fact I'd suggest that the finish is rather dry. The aftertaste is what I love about this type of beer. It tingles and lingers to leave and truly satisfying experience. There is a touch of metal in there too, and a hint of hop bitterness. A light tingle on the tongue is its parting shot. Plenty of green apples and pears (pear drops) are in there too.
On draft (or better still cask conditioned) this is going to be a stellar brew. Tasty and although this beer does not do really well on its travels, this is still a delicious beer."

Beautiful color on the pour with complete clarity and a stunning, bright, cherry-red pour. A small pink, finely bubbled head forms with a touch of lace.
Nose has a touch of an artificial feel about it, BUT it is very fruity. 
Light tartness, authentic raspberry flavor and an interesting sweet/sour combo. Not as sweet as it first appears. Finishes drier than I was expecting.

12 oz bottle. The usual screen-printed, Stone style.
One of my favorite styles from a combination of three (generally) superb breweries looks like a winning combo!
Pour is a slightly hazy, golden body with a touch of carbonation. A few floaties. 
Nose offers a light, chardonnay grape note with a mild, alcoholic fruit. The fruit has some dry character.
The tastes reflect the alcohol and the mild fruit. It's grape based, but is also quite dry like the grape skin and has a note of champagne as well. Mild pepper, bu the beer finishes with a slightly dramatic metallic finish and is extremely dry on the back end. 
I'd like a touch less aggression and a sweeter fruit, especially in the ending. A little hot as well.
Nice in small quantities, but it's not really a definitive tripel and nor is it a beer that is very accessible in my book. Delighted to have had the opportunity to try this."
Avery Brewing Company,Brabant,,,American Wild Ale,8.70%,bottle,2.18,3.5,2.5,2,3,1.5,4/9/2009,"$6.99 for the 12 oz bottle from Bullock's, Marietta, GA, USA a couple of weeks ago.
Poured into the Terrapin snifter.
Pours is a cola-colored affair with an initially decent, mild frothy head. Obviously this fades fairly quickly but it leaves a thin film and collar behind. It's MUCH darker than I was anticipating.
Nose has light funk and some diluted vinegar.
The tastes are rather dry with a LOT of wood in there too. It's has some leathery notes but the wood is VERY strong. A little salty in the finish. Way too woody and ill-defined funk at the moment.
My guess is that this beer is just really young. It feels immature and the acidic notes are nowhere near where they need to be yet.
Actually I didn't care for this much. This beer MAY turn into something decent but for now it's close to a drain pour. Horrible value right now; maybe that will improve over time, but for now this is a shambles."
Foothills Brewing Company,Sexual Chocolate,,,Russian Imperial Stout,9.80%,on-tap,4.33,4,5,4.5,4,3.5,4/6/2009,"You never know what you might find!
So, I take a completely unplanned trip up to Asheville, NC for the weekend and while I'm hanging out in Brusin' Ales, one of the customers (Scott) says that the Mellow Mushroom (a few feet away) has just tapped their keg of Sexual Chocolate! Happy coincidence.
After all the hype surrounding this beer, and all of the trouble that people have gone to in order to get it, I found it a little perplexing/strange/amusing that it should be sitting there and being liberally served in pints for $3.75!
Anyway, it pours the standard black color with a fast receding head and some (but not a great deal) of lace. Nose is definitely the strongest attribute of SC for me. Wave after wave of deep, rich, milk chocolate notes with touches of additional burned after tastes too. Creamy chocolate followed by alcohol and roasty burn.
The alcohol catches up with you quickly here, and it diminishes the drinkability. It's a beer that is not really easy to consume, and I suppose that it's not supposed to be, but I found it a little harsh on the back end.
A two-part experience for me. Softer, creamier notes up front and the traditional bite and alcohol of a RIS at the back end. Alcohol is a significant factor here and it means that I will probably sit on the one bottle I've got."
Pisgah Brewing Co.,Pisgah Pub Ale,,,English Bitter,?,on-tap,3.78,4,4,3.5,4,4,4/4/2009,"Drunk at the brewery on 4/3/09. 
Very difficult to categorize this, nor am I sure what Pisgah is trying to do here, but here we go.
This is described as a ""Pub Ale"" but I have no idea what that really means. My suspicion is that they have drawn inspiration from the nasty, cream-flow, pseudo English bitters that we get in cans in the US. Seems like an unlikely source of inspiration for Pisgah, but hey, whatever.
The beer is presented on nitro pour with a Hefe-like, clouded yellow body and a thick creamy head. It is definitely reminiscent of one of those beers like Boddingtons, John Smith's or Tetley's in the (smoothflow) can. The real difference here is that there is a VERY strong organic, grassy, earthy note. It's extremely strong and this is the feature that takes it away from those other beers and puts it into its own realm. This is what puts the Pisgah stamp on it.
Very interesting."
"Kirin Brewery Company, Limited",Sparkling Hop,,,Happoshu,5.00%,can,3.3,3.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4/3/2009,"Thanks go out to EinWeizenbitte for the chance to try this (apparently he is furnishing the whole of the USA with this Happoshu)! Anyway, I owe him.
I like the look of the can. Nice color and I enjoy the way it feels it my hand with the ridged texture.
Essentially this is a very, very sweet macro lager. The head and lace are better than the typical American macro lager, but it is reminiscent in terms of its (lack of) hop profile and corny, vegetal feel. 
Carbonation is soft and appealing. Pleasing in the mouth.
To me, it is what it is. Actually, as long as we are dealing with a refreshing, macro-type lager we are in good shape. Anything more and you may be disappointed.
DELIGHTED to have had the chance to try this, and to be honest it was better than expected."
Boulevard Brewing Co.,The Sixth Glass,,,Quadrupel (Quad),10.50%,bottle,3.9,4,4,4,3,4,4/2/2009,"750 mL corked & caged bottle with the Batch #68100. 
Pretty BIG pop on opening with some gun smoke.
Poured in several stages into the Terrapin 22 oz snifter. Body is a dark orange, murky color with a light tan ring of lace but none on the glass. Thin film of fine bubbles on the surface of the beer. Subsequent aggressive pours produce more frothy head. 
Nose has some significant sweet alcohol and a little Belgian candy. This comes through exactly the same in the tastes. It actually seems more like an English Barleywine to me, and it lacks much Belgian style character. Alcohol is present but not near the level I was expecting. A touch of sherry and marzipan as well. 
Carbonation is a touchy prickly and surprising for the ABV. 
Very drinkable considering the ABV."
Weyerbacher Brewing Co.,Fireside Ale,,,Smoked Beer,7.50%,bottle,3.88,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,4/2/2009,"12 oz single.
Mid brown pour with a decent head and a little lace.
Nose and tastes are rich malts with more than a touch of smoke (as the label suggests). It is a little more smoky than I was anticipating, and it was pretty sweet. I enjoyed the taste but to be honest, this is a beer that I can only really manage one of in a sitting.
It's rich without beying cloying. Obviously the smoke dominates, and to be honest at the end it seems that this is a little subtley smoked than many rauchbiers that I have had in the past.
As usual with smoked brews this is best enjoyed with hearty food.
Smooth and easy drinking, an interesting beer."
"Anheuser-Busch, Inc.",Michelob Irish Red,,,Irish Red Ale,5.70%,bottle,3.58,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4/1/2009,"12 oz single from somewhere in Atlanta, GA, USA. 08209 VA 94 (or maybe UA 94) on the neck label.
Pour is a very red color and produces a pleasing, caramel colored head. However, you just KNOW that the retention is going to be poor and that the lace will be lacking - that's what happens! Some cloudiness to the body.
Nose and tastes seem excessively malty for the style. When I pick up a Red Ale of any description, I'm looking for a really dry finish rather than a sweet malty one. Strangely the malt based beers are my favorite one so I actually enjoy drinking this, but the beer seems malted out of style. Therre's a little musty, old feel to the beer too which I don't think is a function of its age, more a function of its character.
Strange beast this since I am disappointed by the lack of dry elements, very UNsurprised by the appearance and lack of head retention etc, but I still managed to find it drinkable and enjoyable."
Mikkeller,Simcoe Single Hop IPA,,,American IPA,6.90%,bottle,3.45,3.5,4,3.5,3,3,3/30/2009,"11.2 oz bottle (that cunningly looks exactly like a 12 oz bottle) with 22/10/10 printed on the cap.
Poured this one into the 22 oz Terrapin snifter. Large, two finger head that is retained OK and leaves some lace. Orange and significantly carbonated body with a lot of floaties.
Light citrus note in the nose that is not really aggressive. In fact, quite sweet, tangerine like smells collect in the bowl of the glass.
Pretty astringent hops in the taste and it finishes dry. There is not much to report here since it is largely in line withe style and the hops that are present. Metallic bitterness lingers in the finish a little too long for my liking. 
It's a little prickly in the mouth for the style.
No very subtle, and essentially it is what it is and no more. Looks good but not the best Mikkeller effort by a long way. Ultimately rather one-dimensional."
Firestone Walker Brewing Co.,Union Jack India Pale Ale,,,American IPA,7.50%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,3/29/2009,"This 12 oz bottle graces my table courtesy of Robert; many thanks!
Pour is a slightly clouded, deep orange in typical American IPA style. Head is small and white but has some fine lace.
Nose has the requisite soapy and citrus notes, but is is restrained.
Tastes follow the nose pretty faithfully. Very light citrus and hops gently kiss the palate, but you know that they are much deeper and aggressive than they are prepared to give away at first. A bit like a dirty girl on a first date! To carry on the theme, this is a gentle, almost feminine American IPA with a LOT of character of the more reserved, original, English style. I would not call this aggressive but any stretch of the imagination, and the beer benefits from that reserved nature. Citrus like in the finish with the emphasis on tangerines rather than grapefruit or more harsh tastes.
VERY easy drinking since the alcohol is ridiculously well hidden and the tastes are subtle rather than smashing one in the face. Lovely, simple brew that on cask would have the potential to blow my mind. Tasty."
Great Divide Brewing Company,Espresso Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout,,,American Double / Imperial Stout,9.50%,bottle,3.53,4,4,3.5,3.5,3,3/28/2009,"Had this a couple of weeks ago on draft at The Brick Store, Decatur, GA, USA but this review is a follow-up with a 650 mL bottle.
This one is partially poured into the 22 oz Terrapin snifter, the perfect glass for this type of brew.
Jet black pour that is not necessarily as viscous as I was expecting. Actually quite carbonated too. The head is a typical mocha, coffee one with some good retention and lace.
Nose and tastes are pretty typical with burned malts, molasses and astringent coffee. Not much to report here other than the obvious. The finish accentuates all of the usual stuff; alcohol, bitterness and dark chocolate notes as well as the coffee.
Frankly this is what it is and very little else. If you want a big coffee stout then you will be delighted. If you don't, then you'd better not go anywhere near this beer!
There really isn't much to report here other than what you would expect, and you had better be looking for some serious coffee bitterness too.
I liked this better on draft.
Probably one and done for me but obviously has some serious cellaring potential."
Abita Brewing Co.,Mardi Gras Bock,,,Maibock / Helles Bock,6.50%,bottle,3.13,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,3/27/2009,"It's taken me a couple of years to get around to trying this, but here goes. 12 oz single from Total Wine, Barrett Parkway, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Good clarity on the pour which for me, is a fundamental aspect of the style, however the head retention and lace are disappointing.
Nose and tastes have that typical fruity, dry and mild bitterness in there, but it's no more than the style demands. Finishes with a touch of coppery, metallic bitterness which I enjoy.
In summary, Abita is a pretty average brewery and this is just another beer that reflects that fact. OK, but ultimately forgettable."
Brasserie Fantôme,Fantôme Brise-BonBons,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,8.00%,bottle,4.38,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,3/27/2009,"750 mL capped and corked bottle. $12.99 from Green's on Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA.
I don't really know why, but for years I've just not bothered to pick this up, but having been told that the Fantome distribution in the USA is becoming increasingly spotty (something I've informally noticed for a long time), I thought I'd better pick one up before it disappears for good from the market.
Golden orange pour with some nice snowy white, fluffy head. A few yeast floaties come with the first pour.
Nose offers a touch of mustiness, but a larger dose of mild orange, lemon and grapefruit citrus. The taste reflects the accentuates the citrus rather than the funk, bu it is clean, mild and does not linger. Frankly a surprisingly subtle, low-key beer in terms of the taste. This may disappoint some, but to me it adds to the drinkability and I am delighted to enjoy what adds up to be a really quite subtle beer. The brew is certainly grapefruit based but its really quite light. Finishes quite dry, alcohol is very well hidden and from the taste alone you'd be forgiven if you thought this could be sessionable.
Summer and spring drinking is called for here but the beer is difficult to put down under any circumstances. There is a fine, dense carbonation that leads to a really velvety mouthfeel that also adds to the drinkability. put it al together and this is a very, very nice beer."
Fort Collins Brewing,Rocky Mountain IPA,,,American IPA,6.20%,on-tap,3.6,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3/27/2009,"Taco Mac, East West Connector, Austell, GA, USA. Over $5.00 for the 16 oz pour.
VERY strong, astringent hop aroma that was reminiscent of of much hoppier beer. Almost double IPA like. Standard, mid amber pour with a nice head and some decent lace.
The beer drinks much milder than the aroma would have you think. Pretty well balanced for an American IPA and drinkable with a solid backbone.
I must admit that although this is a solid beer, quite how it can hope to win a serious part of the massively over-saturated, American IPA market is beyond me. It's the kind of thing that you need to drink close to the source as freshness is likely to be one of the beers' only selling points.
Fine, but lost in the sea of literally hundreds of others."
Mikkeller,Black (&#40657;),,,American Double / Imperial Stout,17.50%,bottle,2.5,4,4,2,2,2,3/26/2009,"Pretty interesting experience this one. Had a couple of bottles of it, one shared at The Brick Store with a few of the guys and one consumed on my own (BIG mistake). $14.95 from Bowling Green, KY, USA. (Plastic) corked and caged for the 375 mL? bottle.
Pour is jet black and viscous. The head is non-descript, but it does leave some espresso colored lace.
Nose is as expected with a fairly large dose of the requisite molasses, charred notes, malts and alcohol.
The taste is where things get interesting. Simple, ultra-sweet alcohol up front as expected, but the beer is defined by the finish and the aftertaste. I like the sweet, sherry like notes initially, but smoke cuts in quickly. This in turn is almost completely overwhelmed by the creosote and tar ending and aftertaste. It LITERALLY feels like you are drinking liquid asphalt. This is NOT a beer that could be called anything but massive and frankly it does not come together well. Of course, I'm not all that surprised by the package as a whole, but the feeling and taste of a freshly paved road was a little off-putting. In terms of an ""American"" version of the style (albeit from Denmark), it's pretty surprising in as much as there is very little hop character hanging around.
Not sure if this really qualifies as beer as we know it, and to be honest the brew fails in the important areas of taste and drinkability. I'm not against these experiments per-se, but too often they should not be inflicted on the consumer.
Strange brew, and to be honest an expensive mistake."
Asheville Brewing Company,Shiva IPA,,,American IPA,6.00%,bottle,3.18,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,3/22/2009,"Bomber from Riverside Beverage in Chattanooga, TN, USA. I *think* that this was $3.99 (maybe $4.99). Either way, pretty good value I'd say.
Orange/amber pour in the Duvel tulip from the 22 oz bomber. Clarity is very obvious. The head is very small with a touch of lace. Spotty film forms on the surface and produces a small collar.
Nose delivers a light, earthy hop note but not much else.
There is a decent dose of diacetyl in the taste which is a little unfortunate. It doesn't spoil the beer completely for me, but it does influence what I can taste quite significantly. Floral and light hops which seems quite grassy, organic and fresh. Clean, perhaps a little too clinical. Dose of soap in there too which I enjoy.
Interesting beer that might grow on me in time."
Southampton Publick House,Saison Deluxe,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,7.40%,bottle,4.35,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,3/22/2009,"750 mL corked and caged from the ""750"" series!
Not much pop on opening and it's not a gusher, but the carbonation is huge and quite annoying on the pour. The head is not at all dense, rather it is very light and fluffy with large bubbles. Body is a very golden, yellow color with the emphasis on yellow as opposed to gold. Lace is broken, extensive but wispy has opposed to sticky.
Nose has the requisite funk, but it also has an alcoholic edge almost like an imperial Hefe.
The nose strays into the mouth too. A really quite alcoholic feel to the beer and it drinks every inch of its 7.40 %. The alcohol seems really prominent and it reminds me a LOT of DFH Golden Shower/Era, or perhaps even the original 22 oz Sam Adams Imperial Pilsner. Hoppy bitterness permeates the finish and the aftertaste. Pretty dry too, with a mild burn in the back end.
This seems really quite alcoholic and surprisingly hoppy for a Saison. I really enjoyed it but I was a touch surprised by it."
Southampton Publick House,Biere De Garde,,,Bière de Garde,7.20%,bottle,3.38,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3/21/2009,"750 mL, corked & caged affair. Pop is average and plenty of foam ""gushes"" in a controlled manner. Not a ""gusher"" as such but some foam.
Poured into the Duvel tulip the pour is not ""dark"" as such, but is a distinctly, amber orange color with plenty of yeasty, fine sediment. The sediment introduces some cloudiness.
Head is plentiful but leaves quickly and does not produce much lace.
Sweet alcohol in the nose with some Tripel like Belgian notes.
It's not until we get to the taste that things start going slightly awry. There's a lot of sweetness but it comes with a rather large amout of earthy funk. Now, I was expecting a decent amount of funk in relaton to the style, but the yeasty, earth-like taste goes beyond what I was expecting EVEN considering the style. Soil-like even!
I dunno, the beer seems a little too earthy despite the style. Southampton mekes some SUPERB beer, I'm not sure that this is one of those great brews."

#2 in the Dank Tank series (The Creeper was #1).
Regular keg version NOT the cask, flavored one. This is NOT just another serving type of the other beer currently listed in the BA db, this is a separate brew.
Pour produces a very nice, mid-brown color with plenty of carbonation. The head is very nice and the retention is first-class. Lace is some of the best I have seen recently. Bubbles rising constantly.
Despite the apparently high carbonation, the beer still has a decent mouthfeel and is not at all prickly.
Strange beer in terms of the taste. It has many of the malty, layered sweet character that one would expect, but also there is a tangy bitterness in the back end and the finish. Under no circumstances would I describe this as a hoppy beer, BUT the ending is definitely more bitter than the style would normally allow. This would usually put me on my guard (ANOTHER over-hopped American version of a classicly malty style), BUT this seems to meld better than most. The bitterness sees to add an almost wine like quality and the beer takes on a character that is (nowhere near as good, but...) reminiscent of one of the Allagash Victor/Victoria beers.
It's actually very tasty if somewhat odd in terms of the style and other characteristics, but I really enjoyed it. Interesting stuff to say the least."
Terrapin Beer Company,Terrapin Monk's Revenge,,,Belgian IPA,9.60%,bottle,3.3,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,3/21/2009,"Ok, here we go with SP #5. Still looking for something subtle from Terrapin in the SP series, but ho hum...that could be a LONG wait!
Presentation is the same as all of the other SP series with the text edited to reflect the new beer.
Pour is a golden orange with very little head, no head and very little lace. The second pour (that includes some sediment) removes the clarity and adds a better head and more orange rather than golden character.
LOTS of residual sugars in the taste, and it does have a distinct Belgian candy note about it. We get a fairly hefty smack of hops early, but this does not linger. A little orange peel or marmalade note in the finish. Bitterness lingers too.
Mouthfeel is light and the beer feels really clean. Some heat with the alcohol but not a great deal
Interesting beer since it provides a much cleaner edge than one might expect from a Belgian IPA. I'm not really sure if I like it or not! It has some good characteristics but to me it feels quite green. If I had to use one adjective I would describe this a ""raw"". It feels young."

Popped the top with very little fanfare. Aggressive pour leads to an initially high head but this fades to give a nice, spotty film on the surface of the beer. Some lace.
Body is a cloudy orange that is a tad too pale for my liking. 
Nose is a little light grass but has some sweetness in there too.
Nice upfront mild bitterness and a solid malt presence to hold the whole thing together. Some nice biscuit malts too.
It feels a touch over-carbonated to me, but perhaps it is unfair to compare this to a cask ESB from the UK, but nevertheless a bit prickly in the mouth. Finishes with a touch of residual sugar which is OK with me.
Easy drinking, but cans (or bottles for that matter) don't show off the style to the greatest degree. I'd like to try this on cask but essentially there is zero chance of that.
Drinks well considering everything and is (on the face of it) sessionable, but without knowledge of the ABV, who knows?
A decent stab at the style, but as is ALWAYS the case this style ALWAYS comes up short with American brewers and when not on cask. Having said that I get so few good ESB's these days I shouldn't complain too much. Decent and glad to have tried it."

5.2% ABV advertised on the label. 
Nice pour with a very nice chestnut brown body and a high (if somewhat light, off-white head). Good clarity, some lace and some retention.
Bready nose.
Malts are refreshing with a tiny hop bite in the back end of brew and in the aftertaste. Extremely refreshing and for that reason I found the drinkability very high. Almost lemony or citrus in parts like sweetened grapefruit. NOT grapefruit in a classic IPA, hop type way, more of a ""flavor"". Simple beer, but tasty and moreish. Sessionable quality but I would like the ABV to be a least 0.5 units lower.
Not sure that I would call it the quintessential bock (it's a little light for that), but I would characterize it as a decent version of the style and a refreshing one at that.
One of the better beers from a brewery that has generally disappointed me."
Boulevard Brewing Co.,Double Wide I.P.A.,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,8.50%,bottle,3.55,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3/15/2009,"Thanks go out to stopbarking for the chance to crack this, 750 mL corked and caged, champagne style, dimple bottomed bottle. Batch D8240.
VERY complicated beer for me to review. I'm really not at all sure where I stand on this one but here goes...
Opening the bottle causes a pretty big pop and significant gun smoke. This is generally a good sign, although a little surprising for a double IPA (despite the bottle conditioning). Pour is dark orange, well carbonated affair with great lace and decent retention. The color is rich and it looks good.
Nose seems well versed in the pine and typical west coast notes that one might expect from the style, but then it also has a slightly solvent alcohol presence too - less attractive and it concerns me a touch.
The tastes really reflect what we found in the nose. Some very obviously heavy-handed hops (I was expecting that and it's in line with e style), but also some significant alcohol presence. It burns a little, and the back end and aftertaste are not subtle at all. Puckering dry hops that are not quite as they should be - much too green and harsh, EVEN considering the style carefully. Despite this flaw the beer still retains a ""moreish"" quality, and the whole thin is a bit of a paradox. Strange stuff.
GREAT hoppy burps BTW which for me is a signature of a good DIPA.
The mouthfeel is good, but seems a little too carbonated for the style.
I really feel conflicted by this. On one hand this beer hits some style home runs nicely, but at the same time seems to have elements that are inconsistent. Another difficult thing for me to fathom properly is the drinkability. In one way I would put this right up there in the good category, but the odd, astringent aftertaste puts me off somewhat. I dunno, one of the most confusing and paradoxical beers in recent times.
Good stuff, makes me reflect upon my palate and experience; thanks Daniel!"
Brouwerij Boon,Boon Oude Kriek,,,Lambic - Fruit,6.50%,bottle,2.08,4,3.5,1.5,3,1,3/15/2009,"Corked and caged 375 mL bottle. Opens with a mild pop; SB 45 on the cork. Unreadable dot-matrixed date in the ""Best Before"" portion of the label.
Light pink head sits upon the light burgandy body. Some tobacco like floaty bits sink to the bottom of the Duvel tulip.
Acidic, apple cider like funk permeates the air. It has a very slight fruit note in the back, but it's not really significant.
Taste is SIGNIFICANTLY more acidic than one expects from the nose - REALLY puckering in a Cantillon type of way. Quite harsh.
Carbonation is quite high (as I was expecting), but the acidity is really very significant. I know what to expect from these brews, but this was very rough; way too light on the fruit for my tastes, and although the sourness is (partially) advertised for the style, I find it too much. Drinkability is dreadful for me."
Einbecker Brauhaus AG,Einbecker Ur-Bock Dunkel,,,Bock,6.50%,bottle,4.08,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,3/15/2009,"Delighted to find this as an 11.2 oz single at Green's on Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA for $2.75. The Einbecker Mai-bock is arguably one of my favorite beers of all time, so the chance to try the Dunkel is a simple choice.
Poured into the Tucher Weizen it forms an initially good head but it fails quickly. The color has a great clarity that could be described as ""a simple amber"".
Nose has a CLASSIC, German breadiness to it. There is just NO way that you could mistake this for anything other than what it is.
To me, NOT that different from the Mai Bock in terms of quality and authenticity.
Not especially ""dunkel"" as the beer flirts with sugary notes but ultimate shuns them slightly. Very dominant malts as we would expect and the beer slides down with alarming ease.
Tasty is the easiest way to describe it."
AleSmith Brewing Company,AleSmith Decadence 2007 Imperial Porter,,,American Porter,10.00%,bottle,4.58,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,3/14/2009,"Thanks go out to the groovy one for the chance to try this beer. Cracked it at The Brick Store with the intention of spreading the love around amongst several BA's, but ending up drinking the whole thing with only brickstoredave sharing the ""burden"" with me! The reason I mention this is that this is a reflection of the drinkability of this beer - it was exceptional, and went WAY beyond my expectations in that regard. 
750 mL, gold-foiled and capped champagne style bottle.
I was concerned about he drinkability of this beer before I opened it. I am generally pretty wary of the American Porter style since the American version of the style usually takes away the creamy malt goodness of the traditional, English style Porter and replaces it with far too many hops. Also, 10% ABV is just really, really, really tiring for me - over and over again this goes too far. In short, I usually feel that ""Imperializing"" a porter is just silly. The abiding memory of this beer will be how it broke the mold.
Pour is a pretty standard look with an apparently jet black body which reveals some dark brown on exposure to some serious light. Head is initial good, but fades quickly in line with the ABV.
Definitely creamier, less hoppy and smoother than I was anticipating. Drinks ""English"" rather than ""American"", and in that respect I was delighted. Some simple chocolate and mildly burned notes in the nose and taste, with a light burn in the finish that is a LONG way from where I expected it to be. Cocoa and light, English Drinking Chocolate and patent malts finish the beer.
Drinkability is MASSIVE, and if you take the ABV and the style into account, then it's off the charts.
Having not had this fresh I cannot say for sure, but I bet this has benefited MASSIVELY from aging - my strong suspicion is that young I was would not have enjoyed this half as much."

Informative label with ABV, IBU, style, OG and other information included. Poured into the Tücher Weizen glass this has absolute clarity, a decent enough head and some vibrant carbonation. The body is a light yellow. Pretty solid and as predicted. Small head with some lace but not much retention.
Bitter notes in the nose as expected, and this drinks well above the advertised 32.3 IBU's in terms of its bite. Good Kölsch/Saaz/Pils bite in the finish too. Clean and refreshing as it should be.
As the name suggests plenty of crossover potential, BUT my suspicion is that this beer may have a little too much taste and flavor for some macro drinkers. It's a pretty serious brew in terms of the style, and there is a happy marriage and balanced between the malts and hops.
Very solid brew, worth seeking out especially in the blistering hot, southern summers. Great value, too."

Pour is a bright orange affair with a slight cloudy character and some haze. A few floaties too.
Head is a simple, 1/4 inch affair with decent retention but a lack of any lace.
Aroma has an odd lemony nature about it which I would not normally associate with a pumpkin beer. Not nasty, but a little odd.
""Tastes"" hit the nose first and the manifest themselves in the mouth with a slightly strange, acidic peach like note. Finish has a splash of extra carbonation and then the taste fades quickly to give no aftertaste.
Pumpkins are not my favorite tipple at the best of times, but this is even a little odd by the usual standard. One and done here."
Shmaltz Brewing Company (He'Brew),Coney Island Human Blockhead,,,Doppelbock,10.00%,bottle,2.83,4.5,4.5,2,4,2,3/14/2009,"Coney Island/Shmaltz makes some great beers so I am excited to try this one. I'm a touch skeptical of the need for a full 10% here, but we'll see.
Poured this 650 mL into the Tucher Weizen glass to give a lovely copper colored body and a high, tight, dense and fluffy, off-white head. Lace is good as is the clarity. Looks good.
Nose produces the nice alcohol and marzipan bread notes that one would expect. So far, so good, and then...
..the tastes simply do NOT deliver in the way they should. Frankly we get an alcoholic, peppery, metallic, licorice, bitter mess. The coinage feel is VERY prevalent and the malt (while present) is totally overwhelmed by a burning, bitter metal taste. The metallic nature lingers too. The taste may be down to too great a hop presence in a style that doesn't require it. Either way it sits badly.
Mouthfeel is just about right for the style, with a rich, slightly creamy feel to it.
On the crucial aspects of taste and drinkability, this beer fails quite badly. On the arguably less important attributes of appearance, smell and mouthfeel it does very well. It's a paradox, but ultimately the tastes let this beer down badly.
I have confidence that a brewer as accomplished as Shmaltz can put his right, but this beer needs quite a bit of work in at least a couple of important areas."
"Wild Goose Brewery, LLC",Wild Goose India Pale Ale,,,English India Pale Ale (IPA),6.10%,bottle,1.8,2.5,2,1.5,3,1.5,3/14/2009,"Purchased as a single from (I think) Total Wine, Kennesaw, GA, USA. 12 oz bottle.
Standard pale orange cloudiness with a small but dense ivory head. Some lace. Turbid body.
No presence, no nose, no point really. Lifeless body and largely tasteless beer.
I dunno, this seems like a token gesture for a beer that simply doesn't cut it in any way shape or form. It does not get offensive at any point, but apart from a light bitterness in the finish it sort of reminds me of a bad homebrew!
It's seldom that I feel this way about a commercial brew, but this is pretty poor."
Surly Brewing Company,Coffee Bender,,,American Brown Ale,5.10%,can,4.35,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,3/11/2009,"Thanks go out to the groovy one for a chance to crack this one. 16 oz can.
Nice, garnet color with super clarity. Lovely, high mocha head that fades fairly quickly due to the low carbonation of the can. Lace is there, sticky but not huge.
The coffee grounds hit the nose right out of the box, but the funny thing is that it seems to fade quite quickly. I was surprised at that. 
This is a beer that lends itself very nicely to a little coffee treatment. I love the way that Surly have kept this under control. The ABV, the style and the coffee are all understated. Unusual for any American brewer and especially restrained for Surly.
Very drinkble because of the subtlety of the beer. Surprised (and delighted) by its simplicity since I was expecting a much more complicated beer and was pleased that I DIDN'T get it! Nice stuff."
Flat Earth Brewing Company,Element 115,,,California Common / Steam Beer,5.50%,bottle,3.23,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,3/9/2009,"Thanks go out to the groovy one for a chance to have a crack at this one.
Massive gusher from the 22 oz bottle, and further extreme difficulty in geting the damn beer poured. This is a carbonation issue and an annoying one at that. The experience actually detracts from my enjoyment.
When I do get the beer in a glass the head is high and ice-cream like with an off-white tinge. Body is a chill hazed, mid-orange affair that lacks definition.
The nose offers some simple balance as does the taste. Although the malt backbone stands up well, this beer seems overly aggressively hopped to me. It tastes quite dry in terms of it's hopping and the finish reflects that. Much more aggressive than it should be IMO.
In terms of mouthfeel, the carbonation is annoying. Bubbles get in the way of everything!
Not bad but ultimately I felt a touch disappointed with this beer. It seems overly-hopped for the style and the carbonation is definitely an issue."
Brasserie de l'Abbaye des Rocs s.a.,Blanche Des Honnelles [Brasserie Des Rocs Blanche Double],,,Witbier,6.00%,bottle,3.45,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,3/8/2009,"$7.00 via mail from Brusin' Ale, Asheville, NC, USA. 750 mL black foiled and capped. Blue and silver notes accent the usual ABdR label. Presentation is nice. Minor gusher.
Note: This is marked ""Best Before end of 2008"", so may be a touch past its prime. Nothing to really worry about, but to be honest the beer did seem a little tired.
Pour is a little more orange than I was anticipating and the head, although good initially, has a touch less retention and lace than I've become accustomed to from the brewery.
A slight musty note in the nose. Yeasty - lacks clarity.
Some light spices in the taste and an alcohol presence that was more than I anticipated. Very easy drinking, but it was a little thinner than I was hoping for. The finish is the most pleasing part of this brew. Pleasant level of carbonation; seems right.
Overall this was a touch different than I was expecting and to be honest I felt it lacked some depth. Well put together but it left me wanting a bit more."
Klosterbrauerei Andechs,Andechser Doppelbock Dunkel,,,Doppelbock,7.10%,bottle,4.13,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,3/8/2009,"Huge thanks (again) go out to the groovy one for the chance to try this. Best before 30/03/09 (March 30th 2009 for you Americans) so I sneaked in! I've been tracking this for literally several years so delighted to try this one today.
Poured into the Tucher Weizen 500mL glass this looks superb. The color is as rich as any Doppelbock I have ever seen and the clarity, carbonation and head are very good. Lace and retention are not the VERY best, but the color is ESPECIALLY good.
Nose is a GERMAN malt bomb. I use the adjective ""German"" to describe that particular strain of breadiness that one expects from such a beer. Again it's great.
The funny thing about this beer is that for such a highly rated brew, the taste is arguably the weakest point! After an amazing ""look"" and a great nose, the taste almost (but not quite) seems a bit of let down! It's solid, but definitely not the best Dopplebock I've ever had. The alcohol is in check and the beer seems (if anything) a touch light.
Very nice and VERY German, but it bats slightly below the BA review average. ""Disappointment"" would be harsh, but nevertheless, not quite what I expected."

$1.50 as a single from Green's on Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA. A new entrant to the ATL market just in time for the serious Spring/Summer outdoor season in the South.
Pour has perfect, golden clarity with very little lace and not much head after the initial wave. Carbonation seems low for a Pils of any description.
The beer has a touch of aspirin bitterness but lacks that Saaz bite in the finish that I'm looking for in a Pils. Slight skunk. Not *that* clean, either.
It lacks a little in terms of being a high quality Pils but it has the potential to make up for this by being in the can (welcome), good value (also wlecome) and an OB product. I get the feeling that this beer may get some plaudits it does not quite deserve - we'll see.
For me, OK, but not up to the usual standard for OB and not a really good version of the style either. Make up your own mind."
Pisgah Brewing Co.,Solstice,,,Tripel,9.00%,bottle,4.15,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,3/7/2009,"$11.75 for the corked and caged affair via mail from Bruisin' Ales, Asheville, NC, USA. Bottle says 9.5% ABV and has the text, ""January 2009 +"".
Possibly the most tightly wound cage that I have ever come across, a bit of a pain to get off. Follow this by perhaps the most tightly inserted cork ever, and you get the picture. BIG effort yields a very small pop and a tiny whiff of gunmoke.
Pour is a light orange/golden color with some good head and lace. The head lacks density somewhat but it is substantial and it does have decent lace.
Sweet alcohol and pepper hit the nose.
The tastes are quite frankly not as profound as the nose would suggest. There is a really nice combo of all of the pre-requisites of a typical tripel like Belgian yeasts and candy, alcohol, white pepper and coriander, but it is really well balanced, in check, simple and understated. Drinks well below the advertised 9.00%. Pretty smooth and the beer avoids some of the typical prickly carbonation and mouthfeel that can be associated with some tripels.
Very nice quality but this is NOT an ""in your face"" version of the style. In that respect it represents nice introduction to the style and would be easy drinking for those trying to get into this style.
Tasty, simple and easy drinking, a very nice beer."
The Lost Abbey,Cuvee De Tomme,,,American Wild Ale,11.00%,bottle,3.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,3/7/2009,"So I had an ""opportunity"" to purchase one of these at $53 for the 375 mL! I decided to pass on that which turned out to be a GREAT decision since;
(a) the ""groovy one"" hooked me up in a trade for an equivalent of a fraction of that cost, and
(b) $53 for this would have been absolute robbery!
Anyway, back ot the beer. 2008 vintage.
Distinct lack of pop on opening and only a faint whiff of gunsmoke. The nose is increasingly acidic as you take more and more whiffs.
Pour is a ruddy brown with a small collar of bubbles. No lace. Light carbonation - a little ""fizz"".
Tastes are tannins and dry notes. Very vinous and red wine like. Light vinegar is there throughout the beer but does not really manifest itself properly until the finish. Quite a lot of woody notes as well.
I get ZERO cherry notes, I assume that the fruit is only there to provide some natural acidity and some dry tannins from the skins. Definitely a Flanders Red/Oud Bruin beer as opposed to anything that resembles a Belgian Strong Dark to me.
As it warms it mellows a little, but not much. Alcohol extremely well hidden.
I dunno, quite what all the fuss is about is lost on me. As far as the way this beer drinks and tastes, it is definitely incorrectly categorized in the BA database. Poor value for money, this is a one and done for me."
"Anheuser-Busch, Inc.",Michelob Pale Ale,,,English Pale Ale,5.50%,bottle,2.38,3.5,3,2,3,2,3/6/2009,"12 oz single from Tower, Buford Highway, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour reveals a pretty decent, orgnge clarity and some head with a little retention. No lace to speak of.
The nose seems EXCEPTIONALLY malty for a even a pale ale, and the sweetness is the abiding memory of the smell.
Tastes have an upfront soapy nature (good), but fade rather badly. Sweetness cuts across the back end of the beer in a syrupy manner to leave me (and the palate) feeling a touch abused! Finish is not balanced and quickly reverts back to an unbalanced collection of tastes.
Not the worst effort from AB, but still leaves so much to be desired. I might be better if these beers were left to those that give a shit."
Hog's Back Brewery,T.E.A. (Traditional English Ale),,,English Pale Ale,4.20%,bottle,3.48,4,3.5,3.5,4,3,3/3/2009,"From notes:
Had this on both cask and in the bottle. This review reflects the bottled version.
Another classic pour which yields a small, ivory colored head without much carbonation, and a woody looking brownish body. Not much n the way of life to the pint, but it does look ""genuine"".
Nose and taste reveal standard biscuit malts, although these seems a little muted and sweeter than some. There is a paradoxical finish that is rather dry and woody which almost has me wondering if the T.E.A. moniker is playing tricks on my mind (as if i were expecting a tannin based finish). Odd mind games!
Anyway, the beer flows easily across the palate delivering a slightly acidic note in the end. Not sure if that is intentional or not, but it makes for an unusual combination.
One of the more distinct and recognizable beers in the style, but at the same time not really my favorite. I'd always recommend trying it regardless, but it's a bit of an outlier in terms of the taste."
Red Brick Brewing Company,Red Brick Double Chocolate Oatmeal Porter,,,American Porter,7.70%,bottle,4.2,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,3/2/2009,"A quick note on this beer. This is the same beer that used to be called the ""Red Brick Winter Brew"" up to and including 2007.
In 2008 the Winter Brew reverted to a new style, a Belgian Ale.

French Broad Brewing Co.,Altbier,,,Altbier,5.50%,bottle,4,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,3/1/2009,"22 oz bomber from Riverside Beverage, Chattanooga, TN, USA.
If I were to sum this beer up in a simple way, I would say it was authentic or ""in style"".
Orange pour with great clarity. Bone white, frothy head with some good lace.
Nose is of the earthy malts that so often define the style. Finishes with te same earthy tastes, a feature of the style. Nice, smooth mouthfeel.
Without ACTUALLY knowing the ABV, this beer gives the impression of being a sessionable brew with simple drinkability and good balance. Nothing spectacular, but certainly solid.
I'd like to try this on draft, closer to the source, or even in a non-standard, cask version - it would be interesting. Slight grassy notes, tasty and simple."
Three Floyds Brewing Co. / Brewery & Pub,Brian Boru Old Irish Red,,,Irish Red Ale,5.90%,bottle,4.18,3.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,3/1/2009,"A little concerned about FFF brewing a subtle Irish Red, but I was ultimately happier than I thought I might be.
Nice red color that produces a decent head but the lacing and retention are a little weaker than one would expect from the style and the initial pour.
Aroma is strong and yileds a fresher hop note than I was expecting - really quite floral and fresh. ""Green"" comes to mind. The initial waft soon subsides to yield a slightly more ""normal"" effect.
Tastes are pretty authentic for the style with a big blast of bitterness which recedes with the balancing malt. To me the finish of an Irish Red is by far the most important part of the beer. For an authentic version of the style I'm looking for a dry ending above all else and that's what we get here - a good sign.
There's a very organic feel to this beer with some apparently genuine, herbal, grassy and rustc malts and hosp used. I like it very much. Delighted to get a big brewery brewing a sensible beer that falls well within style.
Good stuff."
Asheville Brewing Company,Old School Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),3.20%,bottle,3.98,3.5,4,4,4,4,2/28/2009,"22 oz bomber purchased from Riverside Beverage, Chattanooga, TN, USA. Possibly $3.99.
Pale orange pour with frothy, bubbly head.
Nose is a very mild hoppy note with a sweetish grassy note in the background. Essentially this gets carried through to the tastes. This is a VERY mild easy drinking, simple well balanced beer. The hoppy bitterness is one that is basically tiny, but it builds as the drink is consumed. It's obviously cumulative.
Very close to a sessionable, highly drinkable version of an English IPA. Much more balanced than many American beers (of ANY style), and in that respect this pleased me with its simplicity and easy drinkability. Tasty."
Russian River Brewing Company,Beatification,,,American Wild Ale,5.50%,bottle,4.23,4,4,4.5,4,4,2/28/2009,"Batch 002, thanks go out to the ""groovy one"" for the chance to try this.
Corked and caged, 375 mL, olive green bottle.
Poured into the Urthel Bock goblet, the color is as advertised with a light, golden body and a degree of haziness. The head is not really present to any degree as it dissipates to large, well formed bubbles on the collar.
The nose delivers that expected very light, acidic funk, but to be honest it is more subtle than I expected. Green apples.
More green apples greet the palate but this is overtaken almost immediately by a colossal sourness. Interesting because it is difficult to imagine a beer more sour than this, but at the same time it is not THAT astringent. Yes there is the POWER of vinegar, but not the taste. Wave after wave of grassy notes combine to give a delightful hay and manure experience.
Once again I must say that this beer is simply NOT a new thing. Anyone who has experienced DRY, Scrumpy, farmhouse cider served at the source in Devon and Somerset KNOWS this taste and this experience pretty much to a fault. It IS true that these beers deliver a degree of sourness that one normally doesn't find in the farmhouse ciders, and that the fruity apple note is missing, but essentially they are born of the same beast.
375 mL seems about the right serving size, much more and it would be a struggle. I might even split this one between two. It's a superb example of the style, but not for the inexperienced. Helps if you grew up on the Devon/Somerset border like I did!"
Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,Imperial Smoked Porter,,,American Porter,7.50%,on-tap,4.35,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,2/28/2009,"$4.75 for the 16 oz pint at Taco Mac, Lindbergh, Atlanta, GA, USA.
AT LAST, a new SN beer that is NOT the umpteenth hop based, IPA clone for the bazillionth time - in itself that's a minor miracle for SN! Congratulations!
Anyway, back to the beer. Fairly standard pour in terms of color, with a smallish coffee colored head. The lace is very good as the beer is consumed.
The nose is quite alcohol based but this does not manifest itself in the taste. The alcohol IS there, but not as astringent as the nose would suggest. The malts certainly deliver the usual tones and notes for the style, but it seems sweeter than many in the style to me.
Drinks beautifully with sufficient alcohol to deliver warmth, but not as much as to induce heartburn. VERY mild smoke (barely noticeable to me), and plenty of rich body complete the picture. Very tasty indeed, and I enjoyed this much more than I was expecting I would.
Definitely worth a shot if you get a chance."
Asheville Brewing Company,Ninja Porter,,,American Porter,5.30%,bottle,4.33,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,2/23/2009,"Split the 22oz bomber with some of the usual suspects down at The Brick Store on a Friday afternoon. Long live these gatherings.
Very standard pour with the black/brown body yielding some reddish highlights when held up to the light. Head is generally a short-lived affair with a rather sparse amount of lace. Looks still, low levels of carbonation as there should be.
Nose has a touch of roasted malts and very little hop presence.
The nose is continued into the taste and in that respect I was a touch surprised (pleased, but surprised). This Porter definitely lends itself back toward the classic English drink that I am familiar with. More on the creamy side of things than the hoppy side of things, with an emphasis on the subtle rather than the aggressive. As a result, unlikely to impress the palates of many on this side of the Atlantic and more likely to be a pleasing beer for me. More of an English style Porter than the generally over-hopped American version.
Finishes with some very gentle smoke to complete the picture.
Tasty, and pleasingly understated. Many Americans will find this dull, I found it charming."
French Broad Brewing Co.,13 Rebels ESB,,,Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB),5.20%,bottle,2.78,4,3,2.5,3.5,2.5,2/23/2009,"Picked this one up at Riverside Beverage in Chattanooga, TN, USA. I believe that it may have been a s little as $3.99 for the 22 oz bomber. Shared with some of the usual crowd at The Brick Store on a Friday afternoon.
Pour yields a very clear, golden body with an impressive, rocky white head and some nice lace. Head retention is good, too. If I'm honest I would say that the appearance of the beer is probably its strongest suit.
The nose and tastes are fine, put simply WAY too hop based for my liking in terms of an ESB. Don't get me wrong, this is NOT a ""hoppy"" beer as such, but it is far too fragrant, hop based and floral for the style. The malts are basically absent as far as I can tell, and the beer is just too clean and cutting on the palate.
ESB? My foot."
Baird Brewing Company / Fishmarket Taproom,Temple Garden Yuzu Ale,,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,6.50%,bottle,3.98,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,2/22/2009,"Having been mightily impressed with my first Baird Brewing beer that I tried last week (Natsumarkin), I was delighted to find this 22 oz bottle at Green's on Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA. $7.99 for the bomber.
Pour is a magnificent, hazy, dark orange pour with a great looking fluffy head and some lace. It sits in the Tucher Weizen glass resplendent! Carbonation is excellent and consistent.
Nose seems a little hoppier than one would expect and also has a soapy element. (This is NOT repeated in the taste).
Tastes are mellow. Definite fruit sweetness with a slight slick note to the mouthfeel. It seems as if the alcohol is higher than 5.5%, but it remains drinkable and non-invasive. The fruit is very difficult to place, but it seems like a passion fruit or perhaps a guava. Tropical in its nature.
The overall feel here is something that is bigger than 5.5%. This is a consistent and persistent feel. It seems slicker and heavier than the ABV would suggest.
This is a very different beer to the Natsumikan. That beer was much more ""refreshing"" and light, and although this beer seems in the same ballpark in terms of ABV it drinks very differently. However, STILL very drinkable and delcious, maybe my favorite new brewery for SESSION beers! Very excited by these new found gems."
Brouwerij Boon,Boon Framboise,,,Lambic - Fruit,5.00%,bottle,4.38,2.5,3.5,5,4,4.5,2/22/2009,"355 mL bottle, Total Wine, Perimeter, Atlanta, GA, USA. $8.99 for the pleasure. Corked and caged. SB 59 on the cork. Best before 06.03.2012.
The look is NOT the strongest part of this beer. Poured into the l'Abbaye Brasserie des Rocs chalice, the fizziess is short lived and leaves absolutely no lace or head. The color is a murky, dirty, brownish magenta. Not that attracive at ALL, but it does seem to get more pink as it warms and less volume is present in the glass.
The nose offers some light raspberry but the oak seems to dominate.
The tastes are where this beer shines for me. A lovely combo of sweet and sour with the dominant flavor being the bitter, dry notes of raspberry seeds. Fruit is strong, but magnificently balanced with acidity. Again the raspberry seeds come through strong with some nice sourness.
This is a VERY approachable fruit lambic that gets away from sweetness and gives the drinker a real sense of what a genuine fruit lambic should do.
Lovely, a great beer to put into my regular rotation."
Three Floyds Brewing Co. / Brewery & Pub,Alpha Kong,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,15.00%,bottle,3.75,3.5,4,3.5,3,4.5,2/22/2009,"22 oz bomber, thanks to BA sprinkle for giving me the opportunity to get up to speed with this MONSTER!
I may be mistaken, but I thought this beer used to be classified on BA as a tripel AND I have never paid any attention to the ABV - now I'm regretting that I didn't get a chance to share this one rather than drink it all myself! Oh well....
The pour surprised me at first because it comes down as an orange, slightly viscous body with Barleywine appearance and a lack of head and lace to match. This instantly confused me as I was expecting a Tripel with pepper notes, a lighter body and better lace. A quick check of the ABV on BA confirmed just about all I need to know - this is NOT a traditional Belgian Tripel, and after about two small mouthfuls I knew this was basically an English Barleywine in terms of the way it drinks.
The beer is basically a HUGE, MASSIVELY sweet malt and alcohol bomb and essentially nothing else. I like it, but there is just NO way that I need 22 oz of this. This beer would be better if it were delivered in 8 oz bottles IMO. The warmth in the alcohol is attractive and the sweetness comes through as a honey note. Belgian candy is enormous but yeast notes are less obvious. Pretty slick in the mouth as you would expect.
Drinkability is AMAZINGLY good considering the style and the ABV, but it's not really very drinkable - DOES THAT MAKE SENSE??
I dunno, it's all a bit much for me. This kind of stuff gets a little tiring. This is basically an English bareywine, HUGE in terms of taste and alcohol."
Abita Brewing Co.,Christmas Ale 2008,,,American Brown Ale,?,bottle,3.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,2/21/2009,"Thanks go out to Roy for bringing this back from New Orleans, LA, USA at Christmas 2008.
Pour leads to very good clarity in the body, a mid-amber hue and some nice head. Good retention, but strangely not much lace.
Aroma gives a malty promise which is fairly well, faithfully reproduced in the taste but also is accompanied by quite a harsh, hop based finish. Drying in the finish too. This leads to a clean experience but a little too soapy for the style IMO. Some nutty character redeems this.
I guess it's true to the American Brown Ale style to an extent, but in my mind Brown Ales need to be maltier and sweeter regardless of their origin. This is neither so I don't feel it does the job too well. Nevertheless, drinkable.
Used a couple of bottles for some bratwurst marinade and they worked very nicely. A touch above average I guess."
Brasserie de l'Abbaye des Rocs s.a.,Abbaye Des Rocs Grand Cru Belgian Special Brown,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,9.50%,bottle,3.48,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,2/21/2009,"Extraordinary that I have not reviewed this beer so far on BA. Never mind, here we go.
$8.99 for the 750 mL capped and foiled champagne style, dimple bottomed green glass, heavy vessel. Total Wine, Perimeter, Atlanta GA, USA.
EXACTLY as anticipated the rich brown color is punctuated with a very dense and large number of floaties. Generally coagulated proteins are a big problem for BdR, and this beer is no exception. Quite ugly, and refuses to settle for a LONG time.
Head is good initially but fades to not much very quickly.
Nose reveals nice Belgian sweetness and yeast. Fairly solid.
Body and tastes are a little lighter than I was expecting. The beer reflects some alcohol richness, but it seems a little thin for the style. Not ""bad"", but lighter than I wanted. Big, rich alcohol malt notes. Simple and delivers no surprises.
Not my favorite beer from a brewery that I generally have huge affection and respect for. Frankly a little disappointing, but this still makes it above average."
Harviestoun Brewery Ltd.,Ola Dubh Special Reserve 40,,,Old Ale,8.00%,cask,4.38,3.5,5,4,5,4.5,2/21/2009,"Thanks go out to pghlee for saving a growler of this from the recent cask at The Brick Store. He saved this for some of the stragglers that couldn't make it on the previous day for the cask tapping.
Jet black, still pour with no sign of life in terms of carbonation or head or lace. Perfectly still. The beer is actually nowhere near as viscous as the pour might suggest. I'd even go as far as to say it is relatively ""light"" compared to what it could have been.
The nose reveals the spirits, but it's not especially potent, rather it is a smooth, almost brandy like smell rather than a massive sinus clearing alcohol note.
The beer drinks very smoothly and lacks the alcohol heartburn that I was half-expecting. It's pretty much as you would expect from the original Old Ale with sweet smoothness and a simple classy, malt based experience.
Very tasty, excpetionally smooth and a great choice to sip and savor at the end of the evening. Much more drinkable than I was expecting too."

Possibly the palest beer I have ever seen. Initial head is better than expected to be honest. Some lace. Apart from the disturbing color this pretty average.
Light vegetal nose but barely recognizable as beer.
Body is as expected but if you can taste much of ANYTHING you are a better man than me. Seltzer water would be my description.
Funny stuff; imagine giving a 64 drinker a RIS for comparison of styles!!!
I suppose it has a role like water - drink with ""death wings"" and all will be well. Lacks skunk so no foul in that depratment.
In a nutshell this sits in a category all on its own - tasteless, cold liquid."
RJ Rockers Brewing Co.,Bald Eagle Brown,,,English Brown Ale,5.50%,bottle,3.43,3.5,4.5,3,3,3.5,2/21/2009,"12 oz single, Total Wine, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Dark amber body with disappointing lace and head. Colour is strong, but the rest of the appearance lacks much presence.
Nose seems to be the strongest suit for the beer and has a touch of boubon or liquor. I have ABSOLUTELY no idea where that is coming from but the source seems to be an exaggerated malt profile. Although the liquor is an odd thing to be picking up, I am glad to have a large malt note in a style that SHOULD be exhibiting such traits.
Unfortunately the tastes drop off a little too quickly for my liking. It has some sweetness and nutty character but the beer leaves me disatisfied in general and lacks much presence in terms of the mouthfeel. A touch weak.
Perhaps a chance missed, but ultimately not much more than slightly above average."
Russian River Brewing Company,Pliny The Younger,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,11.00%,growler,4.68,4.5,5,5,4,4,2/21/2009,"Well, it took a LONG time to get this; I've been admiring this beer from afar for several years and today I got the chance to finally try it. Huge thanks to Grant for the opportunity to crack this one as a shared growler with many of the usual suspects at The Brick Store, Decatur, GA, USA.
Pour is a typical mid-orange beer with a nice head and lace and some good clarity in the body. NOT perfectly clear, but still lacks much haze to speak of. Soapy lace created - a good sign.
The nose is a combo of grassy sweetness and sinus clearing, west coast hops.
The tastes ARE extraordinary. There is a distinct note of late hopping aroma, and it has tremendous balance. Simple and large hops, but nowhere near as aggressive as one would supect from such an obvious west coast hop bomb. Tasty beyond my wildest expectations.
I am ASTONISHED that this is tagged at 11.00% ABV - this beer drinks at about half of that, and the alcohol is simply NOWHERE to be seen (or tasted). There is tremendous balance here, BUT the hops seems to cumlative. By that I mean that the more of the beer you drink the more th hops sseem to build and fatigue the palate. I started the glass thinking that it would be no problem to drink the whole growler, but as I got to the bottom of a large glass I was beginning to change my mind.
In no way is this a typical American, west cost DIPA. It's infinitely more sophisticated and subtle than the usual nonsense associated with many of those beers, and in that respect I was amazed.
My pessimism had me thinking that this might be a let down, but this is one of the few beers that reached the expectations that had been flagged for me. One of the very few beers that just about managed to live up to the ridiculous hype. WOW!"

Very light orange pour with almost complete clarity. To be honest it looks a but thin and lightweight. Some lace but no head that offers any sustainability.
Nose has that really typical, earthy and organic malt note that comes with the style.
Malt dryness is repeated in the taste and there is quite a bite in the finish. Pretty well balanced by the flavor is what I would call ""strong"". The aftertaste lingers somewhat too. Dry malts backed up by some hop bitterness. Tasty.
Nice beer, nicely in style. Very nice."
"Anheuser-Busch, Inc.",Michelob Hop Hound Amber Wheat,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,5.30%,bottle,1.85,2,2,2,1.5,1.5,2/19/2009,"12 oz single from Total Wine, Perimeter, Atlanta, GA, USA.
The latest (I guess) AB incarnation/stealth venture into the ""craft"" market. Strange stuff for AB, all marketing rather than a true invested INTEREST in artisanal products.
Pours a dirty orange, murky and fairly unattractive color. Head and lace are both disappointing; this looks pretty drab and uninspirational. Looks a little tired already.
Completely FLAT - both literally in terms of lack of carbonation and metaphorically in terms of a lack of taste and presence. By that, I mean there is simply nothing to it. Mild sweetness the beer but it is watery and listless to put it mildly. The style is one that often suffers from a lack of depth and this beer takes it to that ultimate level.
VERY poor effort and close to being one of the poorer AB efforts. Shabby beer."
Magic Hat Brewing Company,Odd Notion (Winter 08),,,Braggot,6.00%,bottle,3.45,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,2/19/2009,"Well as usual you get an interesting beer from Magic Hat. 12oz single extracted from the winter mixed twelve pack.
Honey, hazy, ruddy pour with a VERY large amount of debris in the glass. Not dense enough to fall to the bottom, it swirls around in the body of the beer. A touch of lace but virtually no head retention.
Definite sweetness in the nose and this carries into the taste. A sharp, almost sweet and sour note to the beer. Clean and tangy. Cuts across the palate swiftly with a real, sweetened citrusy character. The honey seems to manifest itself as a high alcohol taste, almost like a Euro, slick high ABV lager.
Well, it's certainly different and I don't dislike it but to be honest the two or three that one finds in the mixed winter pack is going to be enough for me."
Brugge Brasserie,Tripel De Ripple,,,Tripel,9.90%,on-tap,3.93,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,2/16/2009,"On tap at Brugge Brasserie and on tap downtown at Buffalo Wild Wings. This review reflects my experience at the source.
Served in a goblet/chalice, the beer pour a typical bright golden hue with a significant amount of clouding. Head was a little disappointing and offered very little in the way of retention or lace.
Alcohol is certainly a large factor as it the sweetness. Mild white pepper overtones (good), but a little on the slick side (bad). All in all a solid rendition with the emphasis on sweetness and alcohol as it should be. I'd have liked a little more definiton, but to be honest it held its own pretty well. Honey notes as it warms.
It seems as though this has become the signature beer for Brugge Brasserie and I can see why. Solid, if not spectacular stuff."
Baird Brewing Company / Fishmarket Taproom,Natsumikan Ale,,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,6.00%,bottle,4.33,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,2/15/2009,"Picked this 22oz bomber up from Green's, Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA for $8.99.
Tangerine pour with a high head and nice lace in the Duvel tulip. Head fades quite quickly to yield a spotty lace and collar.
Nose offers a soft citrus note, but not very strong. A touch of potential hop bitterness too.
Tastes are a very simple, light citrus that delivers a very refreshing experience. The aftertaste gives a more pronounced grapefruit like twang. Floral notes too.
Very simple, very easy and very drinkable. Delighted by the ABV as well. Great spring sipper and this will go down well on a warm, early summer Atlanta afternoon as well.
GREAT beer for the newbies as a crossover option, and it should provoke some conversation with the Japanese angle. Delighted to have it here, and I'll be buying this again."
Brouwerij Oud Beersel,Oud Beersel Kriek,,,Lambic - Fruit,4.00%,bottle,4.65,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,2/15/2009,"$6.99 for the 375 mL, corked & caged bottle from Mac's in Atlanta, GA, USA. SB 54 on the cork. Seemed like a good choice for Valentine's Day.
A light pop on opening, but nothing dramatic. A mild puff of gun smoke.
Nice, dark cherry red body (a touch on the brown side), with a lovely, subtle pinkish tinge to the head.
Dark, black cherries meet the nose. A touch of ethanoic acid in the nose.
The beer is a simple, relatively non-complex lambic that has only a light level of tartness. An excellent beer to introduce lambics to a newbie without exposing them to a crazy tart Cantillon or a crazy sweet Lindemans version. Very nice fruit notes of black cherry skins come through strongly in the finish. This is very tasty.
A touch prickly in terms of carbonation in the mouth but still very nice and it complements the package well. The finish combines the gentle tartness and fruit sweetness beautifully. Throw in the great ABV and I'm VERY happy. Delicious."
Brouwerij Oud Beersel,Oud Beersel Framboise,,,Lambic - Fruit,6.00%,bottle,4.03,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,2/15/2009,"$6.99 for the 375 mL, corked & caged bottle from Mac's in Atlanta, GA, USA. SB 52 on the cork. Seemed like another good choice for Valentine's Day.
A light pop on opening, but nothing dramatic. A mild puff of gun smoke.
A pinkish, orange body that looks a little thin and lacks much depth. Some lace, but not great deal.
Nose is big on the tart raspberries.
The beer is a simple, relatively non-complex lambic that has a larger level of tart character than the Kriek version, but is still pretty mild on the grand scale of things.
Another excellent beer to introduce lambics to a newbie without exposing them to a crazy tart Cantillon or a crazy sweet Lindemans version. Raspberry seeds come through strongly in the finish. This is very tasty.
A touch prickly in terms of carbonation in the mouth but still very nice and it complements the package well. The finish combines the gentle tartness and fruit sweetness beautifully."
"Lakefront Brewery, Inc.",Bridge Burner Special Reserve Ale,,,American Strong Ale,8.00%,bottle,3.63,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,2/15/2009,"Mildly amusing story.
It's 01/31/09 and the day of the Atlanta Cask Ale tasting. I decide to pop into Green's on Ponce to do some ""pre-cask purchasing"" and I see this, 22oz bomber perched on a pile of cases, all alone. I knew that this was not in GA at the time, so I was naturally interested and picked it up. Taking it to the register they had terrible trouble locating it in the sysytem; basically it wasn't there. This precipitated 'phonecalls to Adam who was not at the store. Eventually they sold it to me for $4.99. I told them (in jest) to tell Adam he was running a crappy store.
Anyway, later in the afternoon I'm at the Cask tasting talking with Adam and he says he has a mystery to solve about someone buying his ""sample"" bottle of Lakefront Bridge Burner! Well, it amused me.
Back to the beer.
Mahogany red pour with a lace and head appropriate for the style and ABV. Looks pretty rich. The head gives that yellow tinge that I associate with a beer like Arrogant Bastard.
Nose and tastes are very solid and reminiscent of the Arrogant Bastard classic example of the style. This holds up to scrutiny well, with some serious grapefruit and alcohol combining up front, and the bitterness and alcohol coming together in the middle and the finish. 
Drinks pretty well considering the stlye and the ABV. Some residual sugar.
Poor man's Arrogant Bastard - as simple as that."
Ram Restaurant & Brewery,Triple Seven (7^3),,,Tripel,8.00%,on-tap,3.03,4,4,2.5,4,2.5,2/15/2009,"Advertised on their beer board as 7^3 (i.e. seven raised to the power of 3), the waitress called this beer ""Triple Seven"" (obviously the niceties of mathematics are not a strong point at The Ram) and told me it was 8.00% ABV. It drank pretty well at that point to me. Anyway, she described it as a ""Belgian Wheat"" that was brewed as batch 777 by the brewery. Apparently they mark these numbers with special beers.
Nice Tripel color and it sit well in the glass with good head and lace.
The beer is overwhelmed by the sweetness, and any subtle notes of spice or specific adjuncts is blown away by the sweetness. I really like sweet beers, but this was at the extremities of even my tolerance. they really was nothing else except the sugar.
As a result of the sweetness the drinkability suffers badly and also I didn't mind drinking the one I had, there was no way I was going back for more.
Ultimately a failed attempt at a Tripel."
Ram Restaurant & Brewery,Big Red IPA,,,American IPA,6.00%,on-tap,3.33,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,2/15/2009,"Well, essentially pretty much what you would expect for a brewpub cranking out a standard, solid IPA. Nothing remotely spectacular, pretty much average all the way around.
Rather than ""red"" I got a copper tone with a small head and disappointing lace (clean glasses?). Simple hop and malt balance which is its strong point.
Mild citrus all the way around in terms of the nose and taste and not much else.
A very simple effort which the best comment can be ""at least they didn't screw it up""."
Five Seasons North,Black Beauty,,,Dubbel,12.00%,on-tap,4.85,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,2/14/2009,"Popped in for a lunchtime brew today and decided to give the Black Beauty a run.
Described on the beer menu as a Dubbel this looks, tastes and drinks much more like a Quad, and even has a few RIS notes. I spoke to Crawford and he agreed about the Quad descriptor, but was less sure of my RIS comparison. He LOVES to brew these ""style-defying"" Belgian beers and this is another example of the fine art he is in the process of perfecting.
Pretty much jet black on the pour as far as I could tell with some billowing, tan head. Te head is the color of a typical RIS, but MUCH lighter in appearance and consistency. 
Wave after wave of rich toffee and molasses notes compete with the Belgian candy for your attention. This is certainly a mighty sweet beer, but a delicious, rich and full one. I described it as simply being SUMPTUIOUS. A few touches of licorice in the back it finishes with a flourish and with more, after dinner sweetness.
Very tasty, but at around 12% (I don't think that 15% in the BA db is accurate) this is strictly a one and done on any visit for me. Nevertheless a ""must have"" next time you're at 5SN.
Although there is clearly NO bitterness to speak of, I'd put his down as a Quad or even (despite Crawford's protestations!) a Belgian Stout. Either way, it's SUPERB."
Full Sail Brewery & Tasting Room & Pub,LTD Series - 01,,,Bock,6.40%,bottle,3.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,2/14/2009,"12 oz single from Total Wine at Perimeter in Atlanta, GA, USA.
Nice looking, clear dark amber pour with some creamy head and lace. The head drops away fairly quickly but still produces a creamy film and collar. Looks solid. Good clarity in the body.
Nose has a light hop note but not much else.
The tastes are pretty much solidly in line with the style. Drying malts with a touch of bitterness in the finish. A good, rich and creamy mouthfeel to the beer too and the sweet, dry and bitter characteristics of the style are well married together. Classic, malty bock aftertaste completes the picture. Good stuff.
Satisfying.
I don't know that you would necessarily call this a quinesential bock, but it's certainly a very solid example of the style and something I would be happy to present to a newbie as a strong bock/lager candidate."
RJ Rockers Brewing Co.,Light Rock,,,Kölsch,4.50%,bottle,2.88,2.5,2.5,3,3,3,2/13/2009,"Big thanks go out to casemw for the chance to try this one.
12 oz single as seen in the BA database.
Pour produces a small head with some lace, but a strange, slightly cloudy light orange body.
Nose lacks any kind of presence. Corny sugar?
A lot of grainy sweetness in the taste and not much else. 119 calories is heavily advertised on the label so I guess that they are looking to compete with the Lites/Lights of this world. By definition that puts this beer at the edge of my tolerance, and although it says that this is brewed ""in the tradition of a Grman Kolsch"", I don't see it coming up to par in many areas.
Pretty run of the mill for a beer that an aspiring craft brewer is clearly attempting to pitch to the BMC crowd. Frankly they would be better off making a much higher quality brew and staying away from the potential crossover market.
Not much to report here other than a better option than BMC."
New Belgium Brewing,Mothership Wit (Organic Wheat Beer),,,Witbier,4.80%,bottle,3.58,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,2/12/2009,"22 oz bomber, $3.99 from Riverside in Chattanooga, TN, USA. Best before 6th March 2009.
Love a good Wit, but the style walks a fine line for me. There are some things that must be avoided, and other points that it must hit. I like a really spicy note, and I love a heavy yeast presence, but perhaps most importantly it must avoid a watery mouthfeel. The mouthfeel is perhaps the most crucial thing since it can make or break the deal for me.
The beer pours a typical, lemon based cloudy color but lacks a large sediment presence. Lace is good, better than normal for the style. I'd like it a bit darker, but the good head and lace make it a 4.0 for me on appearance.
Nose: some white pepper and lemon in the nose. Aroma is strong - I like it.
Spice, coriander, yeast and pepper notes ARE there, but to be honest it falls slightly short for me. Just not quite there.
Close but no cigar for me."
Five Seasons Prado,InaugurAle,,,California Common / Steam Beer,5.00%,on-tap,3.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,2/11/2009,"Very simple, copper colored pour with a nice, bone white head and some lace. Looks nice.
The beer basically drinks up front like a simple ESB or English bitter. Very tasty and malt based with some simple hop accents.
Where this beer goes in the finish is the interesting thing. I'm not sure if this is by design (either for this beer in particular or for the style), but it dried quite violently in the finish. Very, very dry as it ends and in the aftertaste, and I was surprised how quickly the mild fruitiness that started in the brew turned into this finish. A bit odd.
Having said all that I said above, it was still very drinkable and tasty - just surprising."
Five Seasons Prado,Hopgasm,,,American IPA,6.50%,on-tap,3.6,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,2/11/2009,"Clouded copper pour with plenty of haze and a nice, sticky head.
Nose and tastes simply reflect the style very well. There are plenty of slightly resinous notes and a complimentary, slightly slick mouthfeel to go with it that is appropriate.
Malts are in check, which again is appropriate but to me the combo seems somewhat tired. I'm not sure if the style is getting to my palate, but the beer gave me a bit of a yawn factor. Why not brew something DIFFERENT to make a mark? An entirely predictable (and in that light) disappointing choice. Slick bitterness fatigues the palate really quickly.
Grapefruit and pine are there, but a touch unbalanced for me.
The beer isn't bad, but it seems so uninspired to me. Loads of these American IPA's are all over the market so drink away!"
Three Floyds Brewing Co. / Brewery & Pub,Rabbid Rabbit,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,9.00%,bottle,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,2/8/2009,"I've been on the look out for this for some time, and on a recent trip to Indianapolis, IN, USA I picked it up at Kahn's. I want to say $10.99 for the bomber but not positive on that.
I was a little bit wary because I thought that FFF might go a bit overboard on a style that, IMO, needs to be handled carfeully. Let's find out.
Quite a dark orange pour in the Duvel tulip, this beer forms a large head wirh some lace but not great retention. Spotty, white film forms on the surface of the brew as it settles down. Cloudy appearance gives away the bottle-conditioning.
Nose reveals a bit of buttery diacetyl, not at all what I was expecting and more than a little worrisome. Grassy sweetness in the aroma too.
The grassy sweetness gets carrried into the tastes which are a fair bit floral in their nature. Definite lack of serious funk and really rather sweet up front. The finish produces a touch of hop bitterness and a small amount of tartness but they are both fleeting. Floral nature is what I am going to take away with me from this experience. That and the Belgian candy notes. As it warms some VERY distinct honey notes.
Slightly slick in the mouth which is not surprising given the ABV.
Easy drinking and the alcohol seems well hidden, but at the same time I was expecting a little more, and certainly a beer that wasn't quite so sweet or so floral.
Not bad; not great."
Upland Brewing Company,Kiwi Lambic,,,Lambic - Fruit,6.00%,bottle,3.83,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,2/7/2009,"Lucked out with this one. In town for a few days from the ATL, and Mike (BA sprinkle) happened to have persauded his wife to part with her bottle of the Kiwi for a tasting at Crown #15 in Fishers, IN, USA. MANY thanks - MUCH appreciated by me.
Totally coincidently, review #1800. Original batch, one of only 48 released bottles.
Sampled on three small pours.
Golden yellow color with pretty much complete clarity. No carbonation, head, lace or retention to speak of.
Fruit notes are basically non-existent. If you are expecting a kiwi note of any description you are going to be terribly disappointed. Mid-range sourness and funk, nothing heavy-handed at all. Some green apple notes, this is very close to a dry, west country cider (England). Sharp and clean, but not very astringent at all.
Mellows out on warming and with that comes a little more round, fruit character but nothing that you would describe as kiwi based. In terms of the fruit, non-descript.
Tasty and delighted to have tried it, but not my favorite of the Upland lambic tasting group. Another example of rarity causing a little too much ado about nothing."
Spaten-Franziskaner-Bräu,Spaten Dunkel,,,Munich Dunkel Lager,5.50%,on-tap,4,3,4,4,3.5,4.5,2/5/2009,"On tap at The Rathskeller, Indianapolis, IN, USA.
So, I sit down at the bar and see the tap handle of this beer that I do not recognize. I order one and start chatting to the two guys sat next to me at the bar. One turns out to be the Spaten rep, and he tells me this is the first keg in the USA!
Nice color on the pour with a deep russet, red/brown. Color is good but the head is non-existent. No head, no retention and no lace. Very poorly carbonated.
Nice richness, but it maintains the lager crispness and easy drinkability. Easy to throw back a few. Very nich malt, nuttiness and tasty. Shame about the carbonation because it takes away from the experience and the mouthfeel."
Breckenridge Brewery,Pandora's Bock,,,Bock,7.50%,bottle,4.23,3,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,2/3/2009,"12 oz single from Mac's, Atlanta, GA, USA as part of their $8.99 sixer.
Rich, garnet color as one would expect, but the head and lace are disappointing. An ""A"" for color, but below average for the production (and retention) of head. Lovely clarity in the body color.
Nose and tastes are SPOT ON for the style. Very rich and malty with a nice depth to the body (don't forget this is NOT a Doppelbock). Very tasty indeed. Lovely, sweet depth to the beer and some serious drinkability. If they could fix the carbonation issue this would be even better.
Good stuff."
"Anheuser-Busch, Inc.",Michelob Marzen,,,Märzen / Oktoberfest,5.10%,bottle,2.6,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,2/1/2009,"$0.99 from Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA as a 12oz single. Attractive colored label (classy green color) with a ridge on the bottle at the base of the neck that is reminiscent of a Westy bottle!! ;-). WHAT A SHOCK - AB marketing outdoes creative and expressive brewing! DOH!
Pour is a slightly darker than macro lager pour, and one that produces a slightly better than average head. Still no lace.
Mouthfeel is REALLY thin and rlacks any Marzen richness - disappointing. Nose is frankly non-descript and the tastes are muted.
There is a touch of Marzen sweet character, but it seems VERY ""macro"" based. Finishes surprisingly dry which would seem to contradict the malt based beer that I should be drinking. Odd.
Not bad, but....I dunno, it just doesn't cut it."
Brasserie Dupont sprl,Bière De Miel Biologique,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,8.00%,bottle,3.68,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,2/1/2009,"$8.95 for the 750 mL corked and caged affair from Green's on Ponce. Very odd that I have never bought or reviewed this since I love Saison Dupont, and I have passed over this many, many, many times. Finally snagged it.
A decent pop and a touch of gunsmoke on opening. Honey oranged pour with lots of floaties, a thin head and some lace.
A light touch of antisceptic funk in the nose. 
Taste has a little funk and some sweet and sour notes. Not really any honey that I notice. Perhaps a bit in the finish but it's very muted.
The introduction of the honey seems to make an otherwise potentially funky beer somewhat bland. ""Bland"" is not a very good descriptor of the beer (it's an unfair criticsm), BUT it certainly lacks real presence compared to other Saisons.
Glad I tried it but I'd never choose this over the regular Dupont Saison offering."
Founders Brewing Company,Founders Curmudgeon (Old Ale),,,Old Ale,9.80%,bottle,2.7,2.5,3,2.5,3.5,2.5,1/31/2009,"12 oz single in the typical Founders stubbie bottle. 2008 vintage.
A bit of a disappointing pour. I say that for a couple of reasons. Firstly the color is a wee bit dull. Opaque orange amber body and very little head and lace. Secondly although the head is in line with the ABV, the whole thing thing seems to lack much life or edge. A little dull.
Nose and tastes are VERY vanilla based to me. Light bourbon and sweetness finish it.
Strange brew for me. Too much bourbon/hard liquor influence for me when I was looking for a lighter, fortified sherry feel. That's where I like (and expect) my Old Ales to come from.
All in all, a touch disappointing for me."
Magic Hat Brewing Company,Roxy Rolles,,,American Amber / Red Ale,5.10%,bottle,3.53,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,1/31/2009,"Part of the Magic Hat winter mixed 12 pack that made it to GA for the first time at the end of 2008. This particular bottle came from Hilton Head, SC, USA.
Murky amber pour with a surprisingly good head and creamy lace.
Nose has plenty of soapy hops.
The taste is surprisingly hoppy. I was expecting a beer that was a touch more malty, but this came through quite resinous and piney. As it warms it gets a little more sweetness, but to be honest it still seems quite bitter.
Pretty interesting in as much as this is really a rather bitter beer. MUCH hoppier than I was expecting to say the least and packed full of resin."
Thomas Creek Brewery,OBP Squared (Orange Blossom Pilsner Squared),,,Herbed / Spiced Beer,11.00%,bottle,3.43,4,2.5,3.5,3.5,4,1/30/2009,"Extremely surprised to come across this at The Beer Exchange in Charleston, SC, USA. $2.49 as a 12 oz single. There is a smudged, inky, dot matrixed Best Before date on the label but it is unreadable.
This appears to be a pretty rare find, but perhaps Thomas Creek is re-releasing/re-making it.
I am VERY wary of this for two main reasons. Firstly Thomas Creek has been pretty much an unmitigated disaster in my book - beer, after beer, after beer has been disappointing in many cases, and very often just horrible - and secondly at 11.00% it's just about three times the ABV that I really hanker for. That said, I'll try anything at least once.
OK, the pour is a nice, orange/golden affair with some very surprising carbonation. Streams of fine bubbles create an equally urprisingly good head. Obviously virtually no lace, but that would be asking a lot given the alcohol.
Nose reveals a somewhat artifically sweet alcoholic smell which is not the best feature of this beer.
The tastes are very sweet, and I hesitate to use the word ""balanced"", but at the same time are not too overpowering. I like sweet beers so this may be something that I can stomach that others wouldn't. Light fruits, slick mouthfeel and more than a hint of alcohol, this drinks like a large Pilsner as the label suggests. Reminds me of an English barleywine.
Surpisingly drinkable (considering the style and the ABV), and surprisingly good given my experience with Thomas Creek. Having said all of that, this is still strictly a VERY infrequent beer for me and I doubt that I'll be seeking this again for several reasons, but...better than anticipated."
Barrel House Brewing Company,BarrelHouse Boss Cox Double Dark IPA,,,American IPA,8.60%,bottle,3.75,4,3,4,3.5,4,1/29/2009,"22 oz bomber. Not quite sure what a ""Double Dark"" IPA is, but there you go - more nonsense marketing guf.
Pour is indeed very dark, even red for an IPA. Good clarity but it seems a touch over-carbonated leading to a little prickly nature in the body. Head is ivory and small, but there is a small amount of sticky lace that adheres to the glass.
NOT typical of the style in my book. To me this drinks MUCH more like a red ale, with that distinct dry character and malt bitterness that one might associate with the style. (Malt bitterness may seem like an odd term, but it makes sense to me!)
Surprisingly grassy, medicinal and sweet in the nose.
Finish is typically dry for an amber (if this were one), and aftertaste is sweet (more paradoxical stuff).
This beer has a distinct bitterness, but the lingering memory is of some serious sweet malts. I really don't quite know what to make of it, but having said that it is pretty tasty and drinkable. If the BA db is accurate then the alcohol is very well hidden.
Odd beer, but at the end of the day it is drinkable. Weird stuff, style boundaries all over the shop."
Smuttynose Brewing Company,Smuttynose Winter Ale,,,Dubbel,5.10%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,1/29/2009,"12 oz single from The Charleston Beer Exchange, Charleston, SC, USA.
Solid garnet pour with a standard (typical) Dubbel cloudiness but a little more red color than the traditional dirty brown. Thin foam and some sticky lace. I must admit I wasn't expecting a ""Dubbel"" or any Belgian influence on the Smutty Winter offering.
Very sweet with some sour notes. Pretty interesting. Not a traditional Dubbel by any means, but strangely tasty. A mix of grapefruit and candy sugar. Very nice.
Moreish, this gets better with warmth.
I dunno. STRANGE BEER."
RJ Rockers Brewing Co.,Patriot Pale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),6.00%,bottle,2.83,4,3.5,2.5,3,2.5,1/25/2009,"12oz single from Total Wine, Atlanta, GA, USA.
A somewhat cloudy, light copper pour with some really nice lace and some significant head. Looks nice. I'd like a little more clarity but it's not the end of the world.
A little floral hop note in the nose. 
This beer seems to drink a little muddled to me. The hop profile is there but to me it seems a bit jumbled. Citrus notes yes, but at the same time I get competing soapy hop notes and some slick malts. The combination is a little powdery and lacks definition for me. Unfortunately I get some buttery diacetyl on the back end too.
Having had some good experiences with RJR I feel this beer has some way to go before it gets my attention again.
A little let down to be honest."
Stone Brewing Co.,Special Holiday Ale,,,Winter Warmer,9.00%,bottle,4.73,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,1/25/2009,"12 oz single from Tower on Piedmont. $2.99 for the pleasure.
Well, the marriage of these three breweries certainly makes for an intriguing combination, but at the same time it makes me a little nervous. Jolly Pumpkin has been very hit and miss for me (I just don't want funk in EVERYTHING), Mikkeller aren't exactly know for their subtlety and Stone have pushed a few boundaries of their own.
Dark garnet pour with a tan head and sticky lace. It looks rich - and that's good because it IS! (In fact if there is one word to describe this I would use ""rich"").
Nose reveals basically a Standard Belgian Dark. The standard dark fruits, plums and raisins. Very rich and full of promise.
Tastes also reflect many of the usual Dark Belgian notes but the detail (and the Devil) is in the finish. The ending is where the rye, marmalade, all spice, orange peel and bitter figs drop in to say Hi! They linger too, to leave an aftertaste that is distinctly Winter Warmer like. a touch of alcohol in the end too.
VERY interesting beer (which in no way should be surprising at ALL), and it almost splits into two separate experiences. Essentially a classic, Stone, Dark Belgian early on, and then followed by the influence of the other two breweries with the spice, bitterness and weird ingredient combo. Funny, since you could almost predict the whole thing from the label. VERY tasty, very interesting and very moreish. Great stuff."
Stone Brewing Co.,Stone 12th Anniversary Bitter Chocolate Oatmeal Stout,,,American Double / Imperial Stout,9.20%,bottle,3.53,4,4,3.5,3.5,3,1/25/2009,"22 oz bomber as part of a trade. I've been hanging on to this one for a while - time to give it a whirl.
Pour is get black with no light penetrating it. Little lace, but a tan film and collar soon appears. Not quite as viscous as the initial color and pour would suggest. 
Nose and tastes are pretty much as you would imagine. There are very few surprises here. Dark, bitter chocolate, decent warming alcohol and some hardcore hop and malt combos. Alcohol comes through more and more as it warms. Very roasty and a large amount of charcoal. Charcoal is really the biggest influence here.
Not a real easy beer to drink, and that's even taking into to account the alcohol and the style. the burned notes are not easy to deal with.
Very few (if any surpises here), just a big 'ole badass of a chocolate stout that pulls no punches."
Abita Brewing Co.,Abbey Ale,,,Dubbel,8.00%,bottle,3.53,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,1/24/2009,"22oz bomber from Tower on Piedmont, Atlanta, GA, USA. $4.99, I *think*.
A little more attractive than your average Dubbel. More clarity and a slightly more reddish tinge rather than the dirty brown dishwater note that often accompanies the style. Head and lace are there, but fairly minimal.
Serious fruity and bubblegum nose with some definite yeasty notes. Belgian character in the nose but it seems a touch artificial or ""plastic"" to me.
The tastes reflect the nose. Yeast notes, some banana but lacks much Belgian candy sugar. Still sweet, but finishes drier than the start would suggest. Lighter than many examples of the style, and the beer is pretty drinkable."
Brewery Ommegang,Bière De Mars,,,Bière de Garde,6.50%,bottle,4.05,4,4,4,4.5,4,1/24/2009,"Obviously a relatively new entrant to the GA market, I picked this up at Tower on Piedmont, Atlanta, GA, USA. $10.99 (I think) for the corked & caged, typical Ommegang presentation.
Batch #2, October 2008.
Nice, reserved gunsmoke on opening. Poured into the Ommegang chalice, this beer sits in the glass as a clouded, honey orange brew with significant lace and a nice spotty film on the surface of the beer. Nose has a very mild Brett presence and a little English lemonade. A touch shandy-like in the aroma.
Really, nice finely carbonated, creamy mouthfeel.
Taste follows up the nose with very, very light citrus backing up the light Brett. No real depth of funk here - it's all very reserved. Some fairly significant, chunky yeast in the last pour.
The more that this warms, the sweeter it gets and at the end the funk is so mild that the beer has almost turned into a sweet and sour combo. 
Very enjoyable and drinkable, but if you are looking for serious funk, try a Jolly Pumpkin instead. More solid stuff out of Cooperstown."
Gordash Brewing Company,Holy Mackerel Mack In Black,,,American Strong Ale,8.00%,on-tap,3.25,3.5,2.5,3.5,3,3.5,1/23/2009,"11oz pour at Taco Mac, East West Connector, Austell, GA, USA.
Jet black pour that is reminiscent of a stout, but lacks the creamy consistency and mouthfeel that you would normally associate with that style. Thin collar of lace forms.
Strong apple cider acidity in the nose that has me a little worried. It almost smells infected!
Tastes are better than the nose would suggest. Sweet, mildly alcohol licorice. A little thin and the cider infection taste comes through a touch too. I'm pretty sure that the beer is NOT infected but it appears to be a ""natural"" trait of this brew.
Easy drinking and the sweetness certainly reduces the alcohol profile.
Odd beer in some ways since it lacks much of any hop profile, especially considering the American Strong Ale category. I'm also a little suspicious of beer marketing companies with 100% contract brewed products."
Ochakovo,Ochakovskiy Kvass,,,Kvass,2.00%,can,1.88,3,2,1.5,2.5,2,1/23/2009,"Thanks to Robert for the heads up on this being available at a local Russian supermarket. $1.99 for the 500 mL can. It's an attractive looking presentation.
Very little ""pop"" on opening, but it pours with a little more carbonation than the initial opening would suggest. Essentially this looks like a flat Coca-Cola. The coloring is that quintessential caramel color with a few reddish highlights.
The aroma is a bit ""sap-like"" - organic, like a tree or leaves! Drinks a little musty, and tastes a little like a really low quality diet soda. Finish has a bit of sweet and sour, but it is a strange combination of old, dusty tastes.
Obviously the style has very few reference points so it's extremely hard to say if this is much of an example, but it is fair to say that this is not very tasty, not much like many other beer styles, not very drinkable and not to my liking! Difficult to get more than half of it down.
I suppose I might try again with another Kvass, but this isn't exactly inspirational. On the plus side I like the ABV!"
COAST Brewing Company,Rye Knot Brown,,,American Brown Ale,6.10%,bottle,4.08,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,1/22/2009,"22oz bottle given to me by Jaime herself at the brewery - many thanks. Generic looking label that has been hand-dated with 11.11.08. (It must be really hard work producing this beer!)
Dark brown pour with some fairly significant electric orange highlights at the bottom of the glass. A very rich and fullbodied brew from the look, through the mouthfeel and on to the taste.
Roasted chocolate notes are prominent in the nose and these get carried through to the initial tastes. Really rich and creamy until the very end when the rye kicks in. The chocolate is very front loaded and forward.
I must admit that I'm not a huge fan of of the rye bitterness in general, but this only cuts in at the end.
In a blind taste test I think I would place this in the chocolate porter or chocolate brown ale region - it's got more chocolate character than some ""chocolate"" beers, especially the recently released and reviewed Terrapin Side Project #4. Nice stuff, thanks again to Jaime."
Boulder Beer / Wilderness Pub,Never Summer Ale,,,Winter Warmer,5.90%,bottle,4.58,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,1/21/2009,"$1.69, 12oz single from Charleston Beer Exchange, Charleston, SC, USA.
Nice looking copper colored body with light lace and some fine, tan head that falls back to give a ring of lace and some fine bubbles. Looks good.
Light, buttered and toasty malts along with some whiffs of sherry get in the nose.
Lovely, full flavored beer that reminds me of some of the best English bitters. There is a touch of winter spice that does lend itself to the WW category, but to be honest it seems to blend perfectly with the toasty malts so it becomes one with the remainder of the beer. Very well integrated. Sherry notes again come through.
Extremely tasty with a nice full mouthfeel and a really satisfying, light hop ending. Very moreish and with about 1.5% less alcohol this would be a ""go to"" beer for me.
Really impressed, VERY tasty and definitely woth seeking out if you like a simple, well brewed malt based brew."
Ballast Point Brewing Company,Sculpin India Pale Ale,,,American IPA,7.00%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,1/19/2009,"Thanks go out to Grant for a chance to try this one at The Brick Store, Decatur, GA, USA.
Pale orange pour with good clarity and a small, soapy ill-formed head. Quite floral in the nose. Not nearly as big as I was expecting given the reputation of this beer.
Well balanced - even quite sweet - there is just no way that I would describe this a a very hoppy beer at all. Floral, sweet notes continue through the beer until a bitter finish.
Not what I was expecting at all. Well balanced, refreshing and simple, not the silly American version of the style that I had been led to believe it might be at all. Tasty, balanced and simple - imagine that!"
COAST Brewing Company,32/50,,,Kölsch,4.80%,growler,4,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,1/19/2009,"Growler from Charleston Beer Exchange, Charleston, SC, USA, shared with a few at The Brick Store, Decatur, GA, USA as part of the regular Friday afternoon informal tastings.
Pour is a completely clear, paler than macro yellow body with a wispy, airy head. Great lace.
Simple beer that falls beautifully into the style. Crisp, refreshing and lacks any kind of skunk. Refreshing with a mild dry bite in the finish.
A number of the geeks at the pub didn't care for this; I say that their palates are jaded with huge beer, after huge beer, after huge beer. It's fairly typical of the American problem of lack of appreciation of subtle, lower ABV beers that don't smack you upside the head. The appreciation of subtlety is not a strong suit of your average American beer seek!
Very solid and certainly better enjoyed in the warmer months, but still a super opportunity for crossover introductions to the beer ignorant (or jaded palates!) ;-). Tasty."
RJ Rockers Brewing Co.,Buckwheat Ale,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,5.50%,bottle,3.55,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,1/18/2009,"12oz single coutesy of casemw. RJ Rocker's is a brewery with a growing reputation in my mind for some super beers and outstanding customer service. A nice combo!
This one goes into the Tucher, 500 mL Weizen glass.
Body is a little darker than your standard Hefe. A golden with a LOT more clarity than I was expecting. Carbonation also seems a little higher than expected. Head is small, and falls away pretty quickly but not without leaving some nice lace.
Nose and tastes are certainly authentically Hefe-like with banana notes, a touch of bubblegum and a little alcohol, but serious clove notes are missing and the beer is a touch too understated for the style IMO. Odd, since give an American brewer a classic style and it seldom ends up as a more subtle version! Light alcoholic soaked fruit in the nose.
A touch buttery with some diacetyl notes, but this is surprisingly not really much of problem. Drinks smoothly and easily.
All in all not really a classic Hefe by an stretch of the imagination, but still a drinkable effort and something I could see doing a nice job in the southern, summer months."
Victory Brewing Company,Moonglow Weizenbock,,,Weizenbock,8.70%,bottle,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,1/18/2009,"This has been a long time coming for me. Although we've had Victory in GA for quite some time, we still got get many of their seasonals and specials, and Moonglow is one that we continue to miss out on. This came from the Charleston Beer Exchange as a 12oz single - delighted to finally get to try it.
One of my favorite styles from a proven brewer, this should be a nice beer.
Lovely, slightly clouded amber body with some better than expected carbonation. The head is well formed and leaves some really impressive, sticky, dense lace. The color of the head is that slightly rust tinged color which is common to American Barleywines. The appearance reminds me of an Arrogant Bastard or perhaps a Lagunitas Brown Shugga.
Nose is as expected if somewhat reserved. Light bubblegum, a touch a banana and a little sugary alcohol.
A touch viscous in the mouth, the beer answers all the calls as it should. Very nice balance (not too sweet) and nicely combined sugars, alcohol, banana notes and a warming finish. If this really is nearly 9.0 % then it is impressively hidden, even though there is a presence.
Very nice example of the style and an extremely solid beer. Really enjoyable with high drinkability."
Abita Brewing Co.,Andygator,,,Maibock / Helles Bock,8.00%,bottle,3.33,2,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,1/17/2009,"Alright, I'm lost! Firstly take a read of my original review of the on-tap version of this beer from May 2007; 
http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/3/1565/?ba=Ding
In the BA database this has been categorized as Doppelbock (No), Barleywine (No) and now back to Dopplebock (??).
Having done that, now consider this newly bottled version, $4.99 for the bomber from Tower on Piedmont, Atlanta, GA, USA.
If it supposed to be a Dopplebock then the appearance is a zero; otherwise it looks good, I don't really know how to score this.
Pour here again is a crystal clear, golden affair with a nice head and lace. Carbonation is strong with plenty of bubles. Alcohol is still quite prominent.
ZERO hint of Dopplebock color, and frankly this still drinks like a craft beer version of a Malt Liquor! I have NO idea what malts they are using in order to generate this color, or what they are calling a Dopplebock but whatever it is it's REALLY ODD! What is a ""Helles Dopplebock"" (as it declares on the bottle) anyway??
I dunno, this is all very confusing. This does not drink or look like any Dopplebock that I have seen in nearly 30 years of drinking but at the same time it's not a bad brew as long as you like high alcohol, slightly slick lagers. Imperial Malt Liquor anyone?? Imperial Pils at BEST!
WEIRD!"
Full Sail Brewery & Tasting Room & Pub,Full Sail Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),5.40%,bottle,3.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,1/16/2009,"12 oz single with a different (updated?) label, $1.35 from Green's, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Simple pour, with a pale golden pour, low carbonation and only a small amount of head and lace.
Floral, sweet light nose without much hint of hops. Identical touch in the taste with a slightly strange aftertaste of sweet biscuit malts and light fruit.
Just as I expected, a very light, easy drinking, uncomplicated beer that Full Sail is pretty good at producing. Nothing spectacular but pretty solid. Take the ABV down by 1-1.5% and you have a decent, American session option."
Terrapin Beer Company,Terrapin Dos Cocoas Chocolate Porter,,,American Porter,5.80%,bottle,3.93,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,1/16/2009,"#4 in the Side Project series from Spike. 22 oz bomber, gold foil on the top, same (edited) green and blue label as the remainder of the Side Project series.
Apparently black, or at least very dark brown, pour with some nice rust colored highlights at the bottom of the glass. Some lucious, thick, tight-bubbled head, and lace which lends a smokey, yellowish tinge to the color of the suds.
Nose reveals very little which is a touch surprising considering the ""chocolate hype"" surrounding the release of this beer.
Also surprisingly there is very little chocolate taste in the beer considering its pitch. Smooth, easy drinking and virtually no hint of alcohol either; it was nice to enjoy a porter which to me seems a little more English than American. Lacks the silly over-hopping and bitterness that many American versions of the style stray into, and instead it delivers more of a classic, creamy, subtle experience. Either the alcohol in this is relatively low, or it's immensely well hidden.
My palate only gives the standard chocolate notes that one might expect from the normal malts used in the style, and the extra effort in terms of the chocolate seems to fail to manifest itself.
If you are looking for an obviously BIG tasting beer with layers of chocolate and a huge ABV, pressed into a package where you get the hoppy bitterness of a typical American porter then this will disappoint. To me, it's probably the best of the Side Project series so far and a porter truer to the original than I was expecting."
Lagunitas Brewing Company,Cruising With Ruben & The Jets,,,American Double / Imperial Stout,8.60%,bottle,3.23,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,1/15/2009,"22 oz bomber from Green's on Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA.
VERY strange. I did not do any research on this before I opened it so I didn't not know what Lagunitas had put together for the latest Zappa release.
The pour was essentially dark brown with some murkiness and not much head or lace. I get some thin film of froth on the surface.
This beer is incredibly sweet (even for me and my sweet tooth). EXTREMELY malty. It was difficult to get a handle on the style (without checking it out first) and I thought this might be an Imperial Brown Ale or even a Dubbel/Belgian Ale (due to all of the candied sugar notes). To find out it was a RIS was very surprising. Frankly as a RIS it's poor; if you ignore that and take it for what it is (a malty bomb) then you'll be OK.
Not much else here, it's all sweet malts and no bitterness. I get Belgian candy notes and a touch of chocolate porter-like malts. A very light touch of licorice in the back end is the only hint of bitterness and stout character that I get. Cocoa and baking chocolate finish. A touch powdery.
Odd stuff."
COAST Brewing Company,Blackbeerd Imperial Stout,,,Russian Imperial Stout,9.30%,growler,4.45,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,1/11/2009,"64 oz growler poured by Jaime herself at the brewery. Shared with the usual suspects at The Brick Store, Decatur, GA, USA on a Friday afternoon.
Pretty standard ""black as night"" pour with a small mocha colored head. Lace is small and settles to a bubbly surface.
Aroma and taste come together to give a very distinct porter, black patent malt presence. I don't know what malts are used here, but that's what it tastes like! Body is definitely not a viscous as many of the style and for me this adds to the drinkability.
Sweet roasted malts and lack of hop bitterness - in that respect I like this. I fact, I might even have thought that this was an imperial porter rather than a RIS. Anyway, it matters little as it is very drinkable (sweeter rather than hoppy; thinner rather than thicker) and tastes complete.
Well rounded and ""sensible"" RIS rather than immensely rich and too big.
Delighted to have the chance to try this and delighted to share this with fellow BA's - thanks again Jaime."
Full Sail Brewery & Tasting Room & Pub,Full Sail IPA,,,American IPA,6.00%,bottle,4.13,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,1/11/2009,"12 oz single.
Very standard but nevertheless attractive, American IPA pour. Mid-orange body with a touch of haze but eh body is pretty clear. Pitted, rocky head that is NOT huge but is well formed; sticky lace - nice looking ""pint"". 
Some soapy, IPA notes but ultimately this is quite sweet both in the nose and the taste. Mild tangerine and some simple, orange peel bitterness in the back end.
Yep, a nice, simple, tasty brew with solid attributes and tasty (ALMOST) sessionability. Tidy."
KleinBrouwerij De Glazen Toren,Canaster Winterscotch Ale,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,8.70%,bottle,4.53,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,1/11/2009,"750 mL bottle from Arbor Place Beverage, Douglasville, GA, USA from late 2008.
Capped bottle is a BIG gusher - be warned. Poured into the Ommegang chalice the beer forms a mid-brown Dubbel color and a small fine head with a creamy consistency. Plenty of yeast floaties.
Nose is sherry alcohol based.
This beer is pretty much Strong Belgian Dark all the way through. Large fruit raisin and plum notes with the alcohol poking its head through to give a nice warmth. Figs and more rich, dark, over-ripe fruits. 
Lovely fine bubbles give a superb mouthfeel.
Tasty and nice to get back to a really good example of the style."
Southend Brewery & Smokehouse,Chocolate Porter,,,American Porter,?,on-tap,1.58,3,2,1.5,1.5,1,1/11/2009,"Oh dear. 
Porter only in name and color. Decent color, but no head, lace, retention or presence in the glass.
Weak, weak body with a dreadfully acidic taste and nose. Possibly even infected to my thinking.
Lacks any kind of creamy nature and the roasted malts seem bitter. The combination of unbridled bitterness and thin body come together to give a really nasty, heartburn inducing, watery beer - nasty.
Southend is getting a reputation for producing some below-par brews and this is a good example of what the folks are talking about. I only managed to drink half a pint of this before moving on."
Brouwerij De Troch,Chapeau X'mas Gueuze,,,Gueuze,5.60%,bottle,3.38,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,1/10/2009,"Surprised to see this on my recent visit to the Charleston Beer Exchange, Charleston, SC, USA. $6.99 for the 12.7 fl oz, dimpled, green, corked and capped champagne type bottle.
The guys at CBX were a little surprised that I bought this (and so was I), but although I have seen some of the De Troch lambics in ATL, this is one that has not been here yet.
Poured into the Brasserie de l'Abbaye des Rocs chalice, the body is copper colored with very little head, lace of retntion. A few floaties. 
Nose produces a little musty nature but not much else.
The tastes are typically SWEET Geueze like, without any hint of tartness or funk. Drinks easily until the finish which is a touch too earthy for me. Definite soil like note which is not funky and reminds me of the musty nature of the nose. Lacks charm. Very mild acid like apple nature in the back and a touch a sweetened wine/blackberry vinegar.
Easy to drink and pretty sweet but this beer does NOT feel fresh - not as good as Lindemans Gueuze in the sweet Gueuze category."
Mikkeller,It's Alive!,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,8.00%,bottle,3.83,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,1/10/2009,"750 mL (plastic) corked and caged with silver foil. Green's on Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Not much of a pop on opening. Pour is a light, cloudy orange body and a smallish head. Head fades quickly to a thin foam and a light collar of foam.
Mild brett and grapefruit combine nicely to give a nice stimulation of the palate. this is a consistent note throughout the beer. A very mild dry, bitter grapefruit aftertaste - good stuff.
A very subtle Belgian IPA IMO. Very easy drinking with an extremely light sour note. A Belgian IPA for those who are not sure about large hop influence in this type of beer."

Surly Brewing Company,Abrasive Ale,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,9.00%,growler,4.33,4.5,5,4,4,4.5,1/10/2009,"Many thanks go out to Grant for the opportunity to try this one at one of the usual Friday afternoon Brick Store gatherings (NOT at the tasting on 1/10, the day before with about three or four of us present). 64 oz growler, one of the last from Surly. At the time of tasting this was still called, ""16 Grit"".
Pour is a hazed, light copper/orange body with plenty of white, sticky lace.
Nose is HUGE and is ALL tangerines, clementines, oranges, lemons and other citrus fruits. More ""orangey"" than any other beer that I can recall. Interesting because it is not really a ""hoppy"" fruit note at all; it's ACTUALLY just really fruity!
Tastes follow the nose. Very fruity and not really any note of big hops or alcohol. A strange beast indeed because it's really a big IPA that doesn't drink like one. Easy drinking and very thirst quenching.
Obviously from the notes above it's easy to tell that all I really got from this beer was the fruit. It lacked much bitterness on the palate at all, and the alcohol is well hidden. Super drinkable as a result and a very fragrant (without being floral) DIPA. Almost to the point of being orange infused! Tasty."
BrewDog,BrewDog Paradox Speyside (Batch 011) - 1987 Macallan Sherry Cask,,,American Double / Imperial Stout,10.00%,bottle,2.68,3,3,2.5,2,3,1/9/2009,"11.2 oz bottle, batch 011 best before 12/12/09 apparently hand written on the label. Nice touch.
$10.99 from Arbor Place Beverage, Douglasville, GA, USA.
Having had at least one beer from BrewDog that I thought was very poor, I was very reluctant to start shelling out this kind of money on a beer that being aged in liquor casks, is simply not my favorite thing. Of course, curiosity eventually got the better of me and I went for the beer in the series that I thought I would enjoy the most; the sherry based one. Here goes.
Pour is mahogony brown. Thin ring of foam forms a collar. Nice legs. 
Some sherry-like notes, but the nose is extremely muted - I was disappointed. The thin nature of the beer is carried through in the taste and the mouthfeel. VERY weak for a RIS, and although the beer is not bad, to me this is basically an old ale. Bittersweet licorice notes, but if you are looking for a viscous, high alcohol, dense RIS then this is NOT it. Also some diacetyl in there too - this seems to be a feature for the BrewDog range.
I dunno, this is a dreadful disappointment but at the same time is not a horrible beer. Having said that it's a poor example of the style. HORRIBLE (I mean HORRIBLE) value to boot."
COAST Brewing Company,HopArt IPA,,,American IPA,7.70%,on-tap,4.13,4,4,4.5,4,3.5,1/9/2009,"Tried this several times last weekend including a half pint dispensed at the brewery by Jaime herself. Subsequently at Sesame (a GREAT little sandwich place around the corner) and a couple more times.
High, off-white head with a sticky lace residue. Quite sweet upfront by this levels out to give a well balanced brew. To my palate this is very obviously dry-hopped. If it ISN'T then it sure as hell tastes like it. Hazed appearance.
Mild soapy notes, some grapefruit and a refreshing grassy malt backbone come together to produce a memorable beer. I found it very thirst quenching and moreish. Having said that ABV is a BIG turn-off for me - if only we could get someone to make such a tasty beer with half of the alcohol! What about a HopArt DIVIDED by 2?? Drinkability suffers a little for me.
With the exception of the ABV, this is a VERY solid English style Ale to me. Tasty, I want to ""session"" it but obviously I can't!"
Cisco Brewers Inc.,Moor Porter,,,American Porter,7.00%,bottle,3.55,4,4,4,1.5,3,1/7/2009,"Pretty interesting find at the Mellow Mushroom in Charleston, SC, USA. 750 mL bottle as pictured in the BA db. Approx. $12.
Massive gusher with froth everywhere and a large amount of the beer wasted. It would have been good to read some other reviews before opening this one but either way there are carbonation problems with this brew.
It's black with a real, toffee colored head. Very roasty, quite hoppy and in that respect it's a typical American version of the Porter style. I'm not really keen on this type of Porter (I prefer a smooth, creamy version), but for what it is, it's pretty good. However the carbonation is a problem and not only from the gushing point of view. Unsurprisingly it imparts a really difficult prickly nature to the mouthfeel which makes it a difficult beer to really enjoy.
All in all the base and basis of this beer is good, but the carbonation is a nightmare which ultimately de-rails the brew. Shame."
Maui Brewing Co. (Brewpub),CoCoNut Porter,,,American Porter,5.70%,can,4.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,1/6/2009,"Thanks go out to BA...for the opportunity to try this one. 355 mL can as pictured in the BA db.
Pour is a jet black with some brownish highlights and a good deal of mocha/coffee head. The head fades to give a lovely, tight, espresso like film which is quite thick and beautifully formed. Some lace.
Very smooth but not in a thick way. Quite light in the mouth but has good presence. Simply balanced porter with good sweetness but very well balanced. The beer has a toasty nature to it and a residual sweetness but it is not at all slick or clingy. The sweetness is not recognizable to me as a coconut element, but there is something a little different there. Definite a nd pronounced chocolate malt; milk rather than dark.
Really nice brew and the can is a bonus. Great drinkability and very moreish. A sixer of this on the golf course/beach etc. would go down very nicely."

Nice mid-orange, slightly clouded pour with some haze. Head is not huge, rather fluffy, light and made from large bubbles. Carbonation is light.
Very simple malts in the nose.
The tastes are not as malty as the nose would suggest. It is very peaty, more so than I expected. Definitely some earth and soil notes present. Finishes with a little touch of alcohol, some bitter dry notes and more of the peat. The soil notes make the beer seems a little musty, and if I didn't know better I would think this were a bit old.
Definitely not the huge malt bomd I was expecting and it is a lot drier than I was anticipating. Interesting."

Having had a whole bunch of really quite impressive brews from these guys recently, I was looking forward to trying this one. Had relatively high hopes, unfortunately I was rather badly let down with this one. That'll teach 'em to raise expectations.
Poured a rather murky, drab and disappointing light brown color with a dreadful lack of liveliness. Carbonation seemed low, and the beer was too sweet and lacked any kind of presence at all. Mouthfeel was poor and the tastes and the nose seemed washed out. Lacked any kind of depth and quality at all.
In the wake of the other beers that I have enjoyed from this stable this was very disappointing; otherwise I guess it would have been generally disappointing, either way this was a big turn off and not a beer that I will be going back to anytime soon."

Dark brown, hazy pour with a decent amount of head and lace.
VERY Dubbel like as opposed to BSDA, and lacks the sweetness and fruity nature of a typical beer from the style. Lots of yeast sediment in the final pour from the bottle.
Quite bland in the grand scheme of things and lacks any winter spice element or significant Belgian yeast tastes. Distinct lack of Belgian candy notes. Even go as far as to say this is really quite dry and bitter in the finish. A touch of tanin in there too. Alcohol well hidden but too hoppy for the style.
Not my favorite, especially considering the style, in fact I might even go as far as to say disappointing. Far too many superior Belgians out there to get exctited about buying this one again."

Quite dark, honey orange pour with a pretty small head and to be honest, not much lace or retention. Small amount of dark orange yeast residue.
Nose is simple, standard and reserved. Not a huge amount of clove, banana or much else. Some yeasty notes.
Body and tastes are slightly above average but nothing to write home about either. In addition to the standard Hefe notes I get some mild white pepper and a little dry bitterness. That, I like, but the beer is pretty straightforward. I'd drink it again in a pinch."
Brasserie Cantillon,Cantillon Saint Lamvinus,,,Lambic - Fruit,6.00%,bottle,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,12/26/2008,"2007 vintage, capped and corked in the 750 mL bottle. Label slightly different than the BA db picture AND the label lists this at a 5% beer. Aged in Oak Barrels and has the Merlot grape addition.
$29.95 from Green's, Buford Highway, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Look, I've been to the Brussels brewery twice, travelled extensively in Northern France and Belgium so I know what I'm talking about, but I have to say the beauty and subtlety of Cantillon and the harsh Lambics still at least partially evades me. That's after years and years of sampling them far and wide. I dunno, I guess it's just not a taste that I am gonna ""get"". It's strange becasue I generally really enjoy off the wall, strong flavors and odd foods but time and again these beers fail to satisfy me. At $30 a bottle, this is getting to be an expensive way to find out!
Fizzy initially on the pour, the beer soon settles to give a still, light burgandy body with a touch of froth around the collar. The nose is wine-like; a light Australian red comes to mind.
The acidity is significantly less than some of the other (even harsher) Cantillon products, nor is this as dry. I was surprised by that since I though the oak might play a bigger part in drying the palate out. Light fruit flavors are there, but the tanin and the skins seems to dominante for me. Mild funk too, but as usual it's the sour nature that overwhelms so much of Cantillon. This was much more drinkable than many other Cantillon products so maybe I am coming around a bit, but if so this is a LONG journey!
I dunno, after nearly 30 years of drinking high quality beer and tasting many of these Lambics and sours along the way, I'm about to call it a day. Maybe I'll be back in the future but value for money is also going to play a part in what I will invest in in the future."
Tyranena Brewing Company,Dirty Old Man Imperial Rye Porter,,,American Porter,?,bottle,4.33,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,12/25/2008,"12 oz stubbie twist top from unclejedi as part of the Good, Bad and Ugly BIF from sometime ago.
Pours with deep brownish/black with some nice ruby red highlights. Head is mocha and very well formed. Fairly short-lived, but there is a little lace and some spotty residue and collar left on the surface.
The nose has quite reserved for a barrel aged beer. I like that fact. I think that the Whiskey as opposed to the Bourbon barrels help in that regard.
Overall the beer is very light, smooth, well put together, balanced and easy drinking. My bet is that the few months of age on this are helping the beer a great deal since I often find this type of brew a bit much. Light roasted malts, rye in the very back end and a smooth, simple warm alcohol note all the way through. Not especially rich but that adds to the drinkability."
Left Hand Brewing Company,Haystack Wheat,,,Hefeweizen,5.00%,bottle,2.58,2,3.5,2.5,1.5,2.5,12/24/2008,"$1.50 as a 12oz from Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Obviously a clouded orange appearance but to be honest ait looks a little weak and watery. Head is non-existant and does not provide any lace or retention.
Nose is probably the best attribute with plenty of mild acidity along with apples and some grassy hay notes.
After that, frankly this is not good. It's VERY weak and watery and lacks any depth. Some green apples but the whole thing suffers badly because of the lack of presence. It's almost to the point of watered down apple juice.
To be fair this bottle may be a little old, but for now this is one to avoid and wait for next years batch."
Rinkuškiu Alaus Darykla,Werewolf,,,Belgian Dark Ale,8.20%,bottle,2.08,2.5,2.5,2,2.5,1.5,12/24/2008,"This has been sitting in the DBF for a while - how bad can it be? I guess we're about to find out!
Pours a light amber color with some carbonation from the 500 mL bottle. Has a malty, sweet nose and a taste to match. Very sweet with some cloying. Belgian Dark? Not in my book. 
Alcohol is there and it kicks in at the finish. Decent alcohol delivery vehicle for the winos and kids, but for me it's a pretty nasty combo. Some metallic bitterness in the finish and a solvent/aftershave note at the back.
Ugggghhh...just about what I expected, 3/4 of the bottle is a drain pour."
Surly Brewing Company,CynicAle,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,6.70%,can,3.98,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,12/23/2008,"Thanks go out to swnicholson for the chance to try this one.
16 oz can. Not much pop on opening the ring pull. Slightly hazed, golden pour with good carbonation and a high rocky head. Bubbles continue to stream from the bottom of the Pilsner type glass. Head has pretty good retention and some very nice lace. Rocky, ice-cream like top. Looks very nice.
Nose reveals some hard fruits - apples, pears but is pretty light. A touch of sweet and sour tartness and perhaps a hint (no more) of funk.
Light orange with a peel like, marmalade twang. Mouthfeel is very light. A touch more bitterness associated with unsweetened grapefruit, but again quite mild. Finish is a touch metallic and lingers. Tartness and acidity finally ends the experience.
Extremely easy drinking, this is a bit like a Saison without the depth of body or the pronounced funk. Equally suited to cold or hot weather drinking, I could see myslef sinking a few of this outdoors and relishing the cans.
Good stuff."

Unfortunately, I disagree with many of those reviewers!
$8.99 from Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA.
750 mL corked & caged with 2008 and St. Somewhere printed on the cork. Nice pop on opening. The beer pours much too dark (for a Belgian Pale) for my liking. The color is a dirty, clouded brown and defies the notion that is is a ""pale"". Head is high and tight. I dislike the color, a lot!
Nose and tastes are an odd combination of sweetness and some funky character. Some bitterness, a little spice and some alcohol. A strange and odd marriage of a bunch of flavors which don't work at all well for me. I'd describe it as a bit of an alcohol laden mess to be honest.
VERY disappointing considering the amount that I liked the Saison. Ho hum..."
Saint Somewhere Brewing Company,Saison Athene,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,7.50%,bottle,4.58,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,12/20/2008,"Blimey - wasn't expecting this! $8.99 for the 750 mL corked and caged bottle at Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Huge pop on opening wih some great gunsmoke - a good sign! Nice presentation, enjoy the label(s).
Pour is SOLID in the Duvel tulip. Cloudy, honey pour with a great head (superb retention) and some solid lace.
This IS a FLORAL Saison - no doubt, but it pulls it off superbly. BIG floral notes are followed by the same in the taste. Light, and without real funk, this is an different beer but is absolutely delicious!
An amazingly mellow feeling comes with the brew. Nice alcohol and a creamy mouthfeel come together in a marriage that is perfect. Summer drinking comes to mind, but this beer goes beyond that to another level of satisfaction - VERY, VERY impressed. Alcohol kicks in too.
Finish closes with some herbal, bitterness - beyond simple white pepper. This is a tremendous beer. WOW!"
Southern Tier Brewing Company,Creme Brulee (Imperial Milk Stout),,,American Double / Imperial Stout,10.00%,bottle,4.78,3.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,12/20/2008,"Well, it's certainly an extraordinary beer and I like it - quite a lot!
22 oz bomber shared with a few of the usual suspects down at The Brick Store, Decatur, GA, USA. I like to share when I can, and this seemed like the PERFECT beer (22 oz of pure sweetness) to be distributing amongst several people.
Pour is a simple dark brown pour with almost no head or lace. Essentially, across the board all I get is a delicious toffee taste. Lovely rich, caramel notes. The beer is very sweet, but this bottle is a few months old and fellow BA pghlee suggested that the small amount of age on this has made it more drinkable than it was when it was a bit younger. ABV is nowhere to be seen.
OK, I admit I don't want a few 20 oz imperial pints of this stuff, but a 6-10 oz pour as a desert beer would really hit the spot for me. Very rich (obviously), very sweet (duh!) but considering what we are dealing with here the drinkability is huge.
Like some other beers this is likely to induce a love hate relationship. For now, I'm on the love side, but with an understanding that this is not a ""normal"" beer at all. Take it that way and you'll feel better about the experience."

This turned up in GA a few weeks ago and the bottle I am drinking right now is the second time I've tried it. The first time I had it I was pretty unimpressed, but this time it's much better. 22oz bomber from Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Good black color and a decent head. Lace is pretty good. Body is a touch on the thin side but does not seriously detract from the brew.
Nice bitter coffee notes permeate the air but the taste is a little milder. A touch of alcohol there as well, but pretty nicely balanced. Smoothly comes together. Actually in the final analysis the mild alcohol burn is what I remember most.
I like this more than I thought that I would, and if this were given a chance, I think many would enjoy this.
Redhook is a pretty interesting player to me. They really CAN make some decent beer, but it's a little too hit and miss to really get my full attention - having said that, this is decent."
SweetWater Brewing Company,Sweetwater  Creeper,,,Tripel,10.00%,on-tap,3.8,4,4,4,4,3,12/19/2008,"On-tap at The Brick Store, Decatur, GA, USA. #1 in the Dank Tank series.
Golden pour with an impressive head and some nice lace. Nice carbonation.
Would definitely categorize this as a hoppy tripel rather than a Belgian IPA. The sweetness is certainly a big factor with some distinct Belgian type candy notes. It also has the Tripel alcohol, but it lacks much (if any) of the white pepper notes that we might expect. The hop bitterness is very much in the back for me.
A tasty beer and perhaps a sign of better things to come from Sweetwater, but why, oh why, oh why do we need a 10% beer? What about a special release that is sessionable?? Drinkability suffers for me as a result."
Boulder Beer / Wilderness Pub,Cold Hop British-Style Ale,,,English India Pale Ale (IPA),6.80%,bottle,3.85,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,12/18/2008,"12 oz single from Mac's Midtown, Atlanta, GA, USA. Part of the (now) $8.99 mixed sixer. ""British style""?? We'll see!
Beautiful clarity on the golden pour. Nice carbonation and a decent amount of head, lace and retention. Looks nice.
Very light grassy, organic and floral type hops that greet the nose and palate simultaneously. Nice, easy going package upfront. Tasty and simple are the watch-words here.
Mild hop bite in the back end with a reserved dry character.
This does hit a nice note in as much as the package is relatively reserved and in that respect it sort of reflects the ""British"" angle. Obviously the alcohol seems a little on the high side if you are looking for something truly sessionable, and because of it the beer seems to have a slightly slick mouthfeel. In that regard it was a minor disappointment. Ho hum, I guess you can't have everything.
All in all a decent beer but I just wish we could get the ABV down to create a better mouthfeel and drinkability to the whole deal."
Rock Art Brewery,Hell's Bock,,,Maibock / Helles Bock,8.00%,bottle,4.05,4,4,4,4.5,4,12/17/2008,"Big thanks go out to brad007 for the chance to try this one. 22oz bomber into the Harpoon IPA glass.
Slight chill haze on the light copper pour with a great looking high head and some minimal lace. Head fades quickly to leave some film on the surface.
Nose is simply, malty and sweet with some reserved fruit tones in the background. Pretty much the same in the tastes with an additional twang of grapefruit and alcohol on the back end. As the beer warms it definitely gets increasingly hoppy. 
Smooth and creamy in the mouth with some well defined, silky carbonation.
Very solid example of the style and an infinitely better beer than Dead Guy IMO. Very satisfying and enjoyable."

Standard dark brown pour with little lace and some creamy, spotty residue on the surface of the beer and around the glass.
Brown ale type malty nose without the harsh bitterness that can sometimes come with a stout. The nose and tha tastes reminded me more of a brown ale in general. Some good caramel notes and a lot sweeter than many of the style that I remember drinking in the past. Nice to enjoy a high quality brew with a ABV a least edging toward sessionable!
Simply put, tasty and drinkable."

From the 22oz bottle into a small Wellington glass, the pour is very dark brown with a surprisingly good head for the ABV. Some lace and some nice legs as well.
Essentially, this beer boils down to being an extremely hoppy, high alcohol American BW which I suppose is good since that's what it's supposed to be! However, with it comes a pretty cloying mouthfeel and a whole bunch of sweetness as well. This reminds me very much of a West Coast DIPA, and it is difficult to distinguish much between it and a typical American hopped-up version of that style.
Pretty nice example form the style, but I've grown a little tired of the constant assault on the tastebuds from these kind of beers. For me, that seriously subtracts from the drinkability but still allows high scores in other areas. Sip it, share and you'll be happy."

Lovely looking, chill hazed amber pour with a towering ivory, thick rocky head. Nice lace. Head retention is good.
Nose is really that of the one that you usually associate with a bigger, west coast DIPA - all sugary, resinous notes.
DEFINITELY an American IPA in terms of its bitterness. A real, peppery bite throughout the beer and not much subtlety about it. It's OK because it is balanced with some good caramel malts, but it still stings a little in the finish.
A touch slick in the mouth, and together with the fact that this seems to drink above the advertised ABV both take away from the drinkability a little.
OK, but not really my cup of tea."
Kuhnhenn Brewing Company,Kuhnhenn DRIPA (Double Rice IPA),,,American Double / Imperial IPA,10.50%,growler,3.3,3,4.5,3,3,3,12/14/2008,"Thanks to kp for sharing this one.
Flat looking pour which lacks any hed to speak of and there is no retention or lace to speak of.
Very light colored pour with a light, golden orange note. 
The nose is by FAR the most interesting element to this brew. As others noted at the tasting, there was a VERY distinct, rich and bright tangerine nose to this beer. Very pronounced almost to the point of me wodering if there was an orange essence added!
After the nose we just get another American double IPA. Not resionus and piney like a west coast version but just very bitter and somewhat unbalanced. Bitterness is not very well balanced and I end up havinenough after a fairly conservative volume of the beer.
Some will love it (I liked the nose), partly because of the hugeness of the style, partly because of the brewer's name, but to me it's a bit of an also ran - ho hum."
Magic Hat Brewing Company,Feast Of Fools,,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,5.00%,growler,4.33,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,12/14/2008,"Delighted to get this in a recent trade with Brad007. Sparing the details, he went to a lot of trouble to get this to me so major thanks go out to him. Delighted to have the opportunity. Thanks man!
32 oz mini-growler. I like the smaller size.
Slightly murky, dark brown pour with some reddish highlights. In better light it settles to be a brownish, cranberry color. Nice looking head but it is short lived and leaves no lace. A slightly pinkish tinge (perhaps that's just my imagination!)
Faint raspberry in the nose, but it seems to manifest itself as a slightly powdery, cocoa/drinking chocolate notes as well.
Light mouthfeel that really takes this away from the stout genre for me and takes it closer to a raspberry flavored porter in my book. Nevertheless very tasty with a mild fruit note that sits very easily giving me an acidic juxtaposition to the malty, light bitterness of the brew.
Really easy drinking and a very tasty brew to boot. Refreshing and satisfying at the same time."
Ridgeway Brewing,Pickled Santa,,,Winter Warmer,6.00%,bottle,3.53,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,12/14/2008,"Relatively new entrant to the GA market, I picked this one up for $4.99 at Tower on Piedmont, Atlanta, GA, USA. 500 mL bottle, ""F10 288"" on the label. I'm not really sure what a ""XMAS English Ale"" is, but here we go.
Pour has gold clarity with a large, fluffy white head with some very good retention and lace.
Candied, bubble-gum type phenols and esters greet the nose.
The tastes reflect much of the nose, and there isn't really a great deal of ""spice"" as such. Quite sweet but just about holds it together. A bit like an English Hefe in terms of the taste!! Odd! Some bananas. Gets better with warmth but still very light.
Very light and drinkable and not an especially good example of a Winter Warmer, but a decent brew."
Smuttynose Brewing Company,Smuttynose Barleywine Style Ale (Big Beer Series),,,American Barleywine,10.00%,bottle,3.95,4,4,4,3.5,4,12/14/2008,"2007 vintage (I think). 22oz bottle as part of a trade with BA... Thanks. Shared with a few of the usual suspects at The Brick Store.
Nice, clouded ornage pour with a smallish, bubbly, light head. Not much head to speak of but it does leave a very nice sticky lace on the glass. Considering the ABV it's a pretty good looking effort.
Nice combo of sweet sugars, alcohol and hops in the nose. As expected.
Alcohol is not really HUGELY upfront but it still seems a little hot. To be honest I think this is simply a function of the style rather than the particular beer. In fact, on reflection, although not as sweet as an English BW, this drinks quite a lot more like the English version rather than the often, overly hoppy American version of the style. in that respect I quite like it. Certainly compared to the Vermonster (consumed in the same tasting) it is nowhere near as hoppy. Obviously a little slick in the mouth but that's to be expected.
Drinkability is pretty good for the style and the ABV, but it's never gonna beer an easy beer to get down in any quantity or with any extreme ease."
The Lost Abbey,Saints' Devotion,,,Belgian Pale Ale,6.30%,bottle,2.73,3,2.5,2.5,3.5,3,12/14/2008,"Thanks go out to Lance for sharing this one at The Brick Store on a Friday afternoon. 750 mL corked & caged.
Nice orange pour with a minimal head. Has the look of a classic Belgian Pale but without the high rocky head that I would like.
I'm a bit confused with this. It reminds me a bit of the Jolly Pumpkin nonense where Brett ends up in beers where it simply shouldn't be. Here the Brett in the nose and the taste compete with the Belgian sweetness and yeast and as a result we end up wih a bit of an odd beer. The total package doesn't meld all that well for me and I end up confused and disappointed with the beer as a whole.
I dunno, drinkability suffers and I get a bit annoyed with brewers tinkering with style where it's just NOT necessary. VERY infrequently do we get a major success and more often than not we end up with a unhappy marriage.
One of the poorest Lost Abbey efforts for me."

Poured into the Brasseries de l'Abbaye des Rocs chalice, there is nice clarity on the the amber pour with some decent carbonation and a small head that fades to give a thin film on the surface of the beer.
Very light lemon(ade) in the nose.
Very light herbal note in the back of the beer but it is not pronounced. Especially surprising since the beer is described as a Herbed/Spiced effort. Dry in the finish that is accompanied by a little biterness too.
Actually the overwhelming feeling here is that os one which is reminiscent of an English shandy. The lemonade note comes through quite strongly and this is something I have experienced before in DFH Pangaea http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/10099/9171/?ba=Ding
I like the presentation but outside of that I doubt that I would buy this again. It's pretty light though, and I'm thinking this could be a Christmas party aperitif or even a crossover beer. Interesting, but probably a one-off for me."

Pour is a dark, garnet body with an ivory head and plenty of sticky lace. Good looking.
Nose is very bland. Lacks anything other than a little malt. Disappointing.
Tastes are essentially that of a slightly acidic, malt based English ale. Lacks any kind of Winter Warmer spice as far as I can tell. Don't get me wrong, this is a pretty tasty, simple, ESB type ale with an easy drinkability and a nice mellow mouthfeel. Finishes dryish and is pretty nice.
No Winter Warmer here, but a tasty brew nonetheless."
Russian River Brewing Company,Consecration,,,American Wild Ale,10.00%,growler,2.68,3,3,2.5,4,2,12/13/2008,"Thanks go out to Grant for sharing this one a The Brick Store yesterday afternoon.
Right off the top those RR growlers are just superb to look at! For me, that's where the joy sort of ends.
I think it is difficult to even consider the American Wild Ale style since I currently feel it is pretty ill-defined. So, as a result some may feel that this review is not fair because it is not considering the style but when (as I feel) the style is poorly defined, I think that it's OK to give an honest opinion based upon the beer standing alone.
Dead pour, but nice garnet color. Nose it simply sinus clearing acid notes. The taste to me is reminiscent of a light malt vinegar and not much else. The ethanoic acid is just overwhelming to me and I get very little else.
I could only manage a very small amount of this and although one might think that you could compare this to a typical Belgian sour I think it lacks the subtlety of many of those. Throw in the ABV and the less than stellar drinkability and I feel this is just not all that good."

12oz bottle, Taco Mac, Marietta, GA, USA.
Murky brown pour with a decent, high pitted head with good lace and retention. The color isn't inspiring but nevertheless it looks pretty good in the glass after an agressive pour.
A malty brew, this reminds me much more of an English ESB and the moniker of Winter Warmer is pretty misleading. I get very little spice at all, and the beer reminds me much more of an English Strong Ale than much else. Not really a seasonal or Winter feel about the beer at all. Plenty of simple malts against a light hop background.
I enjoyed drinking this very much, and the mouthfeel, ABV and other attributes are nicely balanced. However, if you are looking for a classic Winter Warmer I think you may be disappointed. On the other hand take it for what it is and enjoy it."

Complete clarity on the pour with good carbonation, a nice, bone-white head and nice retention and lace. Tidy beer to look at.
Nose has very light hops and a soapy undertone - typical for the origin and for the style.
This is a pretty dry beer and to be honest has NOTHING to do with ""Christmas"" or ""Winter"" (at least in the American sense of the words). More reasons (as if we needed any) for this brew to be misnderstood in the USA! (By that I mean no spice elements).
Hops and the malt base are in perfect harmony here, and both are understated (more confusion for the American drinker!)
Drinkability is enormous and the subtle balance here is the key.
As I said above, this is a drier beer than many of the style and the typical, sweet maltiness is well under-played. Becasue of the balance and clever working of the style, this does NOT make the beer a hoppy one. It makes it a clever one.
This is a great beer IMO, but on cask and closer to the source would probably knock my socks off!"

Dirty brown, cloudy pour with a really good, ivory colored head. The lace (or rather lack of it) is a little disappointing but given the ABV I shouldn't be too upset!
The nose is obviously VERY strong - it is certainly bourbon based, but closer inspection with the nostrils reveals some very serious brown sugar and molasses in the aroma. Either way it makes it half way across the room!
Tastes unsurprisingly reflect the nose with extra sherry emphasis thrown in with the bourbon. Alcohol is there in the taste but is does NOT burn, and to be honest it is very well hidden.
This is an extraordinary beer because of the way it drinks. Considering the style, the bourbon and the ABV I was expecting this to be a real effort to get down, but in the end it was exactly the opoosite. Drinkability for the style and considering the vital statistics for the beer, is HUGE.
Pretty amazing that a beer in this style and of this size seems so easy to put away.
Massive brew but Magic hat pulls it off amazingly well - great stuff! I wouldn't want it every day, but as a treat from time to time, delicious!"

Having tried a few of the RJ Rockers line so far (and been impressed) I was happy to see this and keen to give it a whirl.
Pour is somewhat ordinary looking in terms of color (a golden macro color), but above average in terms of head and lace.
Nose is an interesting combination of faint cinnamon and a bunch of other spices. This carries through to the tastes where we get an solid but subtle arrangement of Winter Warmer tastes with mixed spice, cinnamon and orange peel all coming through nicely. It is VERY well balanced and has a very light touch in the mouth but still manages to be satisfying.
The REALLY interesting thing about this beer is that it combines the typical spices of a Winter Warmer in a lager like body and background. Normally you'd expect this array of tastes in a darker malt based ale so it makes for a pretty unusual, if not unique beer.
Another strong brew from an increasingly impressive stable. Someone is doing something right in the early days of this emerging player. I'm going to be taking a close interest in their future."

Winter Warmer?? No it isn't.
Frankly this drinks like a maple nut or honey infused brown ale. There were words on the label that said something like ""infused with natural flavors"" - a bit of a worry to me. Fairly astringent caramel flavor which seems artificial.
Good clarity on the pour, nice head and really it looks nice. Has a sweet taste that seems like honey to me, but it is pretty sweet whatever it is. Won't be to everyones taste.
A little aftertaste in the finish.
Simple, sweet nutty elements and the honey comes through again and again.
Tasty to me, but some won't like this beer. Nothing special here but I enjoyed it as a one off."

High, bright white head with good density, retention and lace. Body is typically clouded, golden yellow.
Very big citrus, herbal, spice nose with the emphasis on citrus. Whilst the beer has plenty of the typical Wit notes, it remains quite acidic and tart. There are combo's of lemon and apples and some alcohol in the finish.
Interesting beer since it seems to combine the traditional strengths and characteristics of a Wit, but at the same time push the envelope a little with alcohol, acidity and extra bite."
Southampton Publick House,Southampton Altbier,,,Altbier,5.00%,bottle,4.58,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,12/3/2008,"Very happy to accept this into the ATL market in the last few weeks. 12oz single from Tower on Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA. Contract brewed I believe.
Beaufiful clarity on the pour, super light amber color nice carbonation and a decent head. Not much lace. Color is a simple chestnut brown.
Great, sweet malty wave after wave of richness greets the tongue and is full and delicious. Richness is the key and its a really full-flavored beer. Nicely in style too.
Extremely easy drinking and it seems massively sessionable. I really like this a lot."
Stoudts Brewing Co.,Stoudt's Blonde Double MaiBock,,,Maibock / Helles Bock,7.00%,bottle,3.95,4,4,4,3.5,4,12/2/2008,"12oz single from Mac's Midtown, Atlanta, GA, USA. A little past its best before date, purchased as part of the $8.99 mixed sixer. Label different to the picture in the BA db.
Aggressive pour leads to a nice formed, fluffy head with some really good lace. This sits on top of a golden body with excellent clarity. Carbonation is low, but perhaps a function of the beer being a little older than I would normally be drinking it.
For some reason, the initial tastes remind me of a 1980's Whitbread Pale Ale - no idea why. Very bready and malty up front with a nice hop bitterness. This gives way to a sweeter finish than the initial tastes would suggest. It also come with some extra fruity notes and a little white pepper. Almost tripel like. 
Finishes strong with more alcohol present than up front. Drinks nicely and easily.
Very tasty and a nice interpretation. I enjoyed it."
Redhook Ale Brewery,Winterhook Winter Ale,,,Winter Warmer,5.90%,on-tap,3.83,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,11/30/2008,"16 oz pint on tap at Taco Mac, Douglasville, GA, USA.
Interesting one this. The first pint that I was given had a very nasty, plastic taste about it. I was pretty sure it was line cleaner which is ironic given what the line cleaner is supposed to do. The bar manager Ben was called, and he pulled a full pitcher off and the resulting pint was very tasty. Just a little effort is all that it generally takes.
Chestnut brown pour with very nice clarity. The head is a little too small for me, and the retention and lace were both poor. With a better head this would be a really nice looking pint.
Some initial waves of caramel sweetness and malt (as I would expect), but VERY surprisingly this essentially becaomes quite a little hop bomb. Nothing spectacular of course, but noticeable, citrus dry character and a fairly bitter note in the finish and aftertaste. Feels a touch ""West Coast IPAey!""
VERY surprised by the hoppy nature of this brew and it is fairly well put together. After the initial problem with the pint this drank rather nicely. A happy experience and one i was not expecting."

I think this beer would do better than one would anticipate.
12 oz single from Tower on Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA.
What an EXTRAORDINARY experience!
ALARMING purple pour with no head and virtually no lace.
Considering that this is supposed to be a fruit beer, there is virtually no nose - I mean NOTHING. I suppose at least there is no nasty, skunk but nevertheless one would expect more. 
When it comes down to it this is simply ""fruity"" and sweet. It certainly doesn't feel as though the beer has a particular blueberry note, but is does have a generic fruit element and it certainly has a residual sweetness. 
Also astonished by the 8% ABV - admittedly is DOES seems a little higher than your standard macro lager, but at the same time the alcohol is very well hidden.
Beer that women will love, but most men will not like. This is a super sweet brew that I quite like! Amazing isn't it!?!? Drinkable (as long as you don't mind really sweet stuff), but in the end I think it was a decent fruit beer. Is it a classic Belgian Lambic? Certainly not, but I might even go there again!
Englishmen from the '80's should think, ""Lager and Black""!! ;-)"

Typical macro pour with a lack of head and lace and a golden macro pour.
To be honest it's difficult for me to distinguish this from many other, mass produced lagers. Light mouthfeel with corny, vegetal elements and not much else. Nose is non-descript.
The beer lacks any kind of presence (both in terms of body and taste) and this beer is an all round disappointment.

Nothing to report on the pour. Disappointing head and lace and the beer body is a little more orange than one would expect.
Nose is frankly pretty skunky.
Not a very clean beer. The finish DOES have a characteristic bitter Pils edge but outside of that it drinks quite poorly.
Tannin seems to come through in the finish as well.
Not an impressive beer to me at all, nor does it seem like a classic Pils. It seems old and tired as much as anything else, and in terms of the style that is a BIG problem. In a Pils I need freshness and a lively edge with youth and character. This has none of those attributes. Poor."

Pour is a darker golden color than the BA designated style might suggest. Head and lace are also superior than a normal macro lager.
Definitely more bitterness in the initial tastes and finish, but this beer still seems a little astringenet in terms of the edgy solvent alcohol and mouthfeel.
Not 100% sure what Magic Hat are trying to achieve here, but they've done enough in the past to earn my respect. Seems a bit ""Malt Liquoresque"" to me.
I dunno, it might be better for brewers like MH to be putting more effort into other styles, but for what it is, this is above average. Would I seek it out again? No, but there you go."

A Wit??? A TERRIBLE example of the style with a TOTAL lack of depth, flavor and no presence. Dreadful. This is tragic.
It's a poor macro lager and a dreadful Wit - in fact it has no orange peel or coriander characteristics that I can pick up at ALL.
A slightly clouded, macro lager like pour with no head and no lace. Looks weak and pissy.
The really disappointing thing here is this; I don't care if this is disappointing to me, but if non-craft beer drinkers pick this up and they think it is a good representation of a Wit, then that is a disaster! Brewers need to take more responsibility - this is dreadful.
Avoid."

Again, not easy to distinguish a number of these Bernard brews from one another, but this one IS 4.70% ABV, and is a Czech Pils so I feel fairly confident this is the correct place to put this review.
Very standard in most respects. Nice, clean looking pour with good clarity, mid-gold color and a decent if not very well retained head. 
Malts dominante up front but as expected this fades to give a bitter, hop finish. Clean and unspectacular might be the best way to describe this.
Simple fare, and if you wanted to know what this style was all about you could do worse. At $2.99 for the 500 mL flip top bottle it also represents decent value. Not something that I would necessarily recommend or indeed buy again, but slightly above average I would say."

Straight into the Ommegang chalice with a deliberately aggressive pour on my part. Clarity is good, but it is a very pale, macro lemony color. Head is gone quite quickly and the lace left behind is minimal.
Nose is fairly sweet with sinus clearing alcohol and a little spice.
Soft esters greet the taste with a little warming solvent alcohol too. The ester fruits are not very well defined and the alcohol bitterness hits agsin in the finish. Definite Belgian sugar candy notes and a very mild touch of Wit like spice. It's quite thin, and lacks depth in all areas. The mouthfeel is the poorest impression of a genuine Belgian and the other characteristics also fall a little short.
I dunno, not a bad effort but Duvel it ain't! Maybe it's not trying to be a Duvel clone, but it ultimately strikes me as the type of beer that might be produced for a Belgian macro market!"

22oz, gold foiled bomber. 2008 vintage.
Nice to see a lager getting some special treatment.
Solid red brown body with an ivory head with good retention. Some sparse lace.
Very clean nose, not much to report other than some balanced malts.
Funny this, because I kept expecting to taste it and get some smoked malts!? I have no idea why - odd mind games. Creamy mouthfeel and a robust feeling permeates the whole beer. Simple malt and hop balance that is clean and sturdy. Gives the impression of a well balanced brew. Mild nuttiness; dry, slightly bitter and yeasty in the finish. Dry caramel too.
Solid beer and an easy drinking lager but ceratinly not spectacular. You can do a lot more with the Bock style, but nevertheless I still enjoyed it very much."

Clouded amber pour with an excellent head, retention and lace are good too. It looks pretty darn good.
Nose and tastes remind me of a MUCH higher ABV, higher hopped DIPA. It has that cloying DIPA sweetness and a strong cloying hop based aftertaste. A bit ""West Coast"" in terms of the taste.
Very odd beer that drinks in a completely different manner than I was expecting. Alcohol seems stronger than the advertised ABV and the strong, sugary notes are difficult to avoid. Weird."
Country Life Brewery,Golden Pig,,,English Bitter,4.70%,cask,4.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,11/27/2008,"From notes:
Interesting brew this, mainly because it has the name and the appearance that would suggest that it is one of the infamous ""Golden Ales"" that have grown up in England over the last few years as dumbed down, traditional English Bitters. HOWEVER, despite the appearance (which is decidedly in the Golden Ale category), this beer drinks as a definite, standard English Bitter to me.
A yellowish appearance with nice, bubbly head and a decent spread of lace, the challenger nose is distinct. The tastes are obviously malt based, but the crystal malt that's in the beer gives it a deceptive look. It drinks a with a greater caramel note than the color would suggest.
Light floral hops complete the package. ""Sessionable""? I suppose (without being a session beer), but approaching 5% there are still plenty of beers with more scope than this on a hot day.
Bit of an odd one - it's a better beer than the name or the appearance would suggest!"

Schneider & Sohn GmbH,Schneider Weisse Original,,,Hefeweizen,5.40%,bottle,3.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,11/27/2008,"Extraordinary that I have not reviewed this before now. $4.29 for the 500 mL bottle from the new Total Wine store in the Perimeter area of Atlanta/Dunwoody, GA, USA.
The appearance of this beer always confuses me a little - much darker than I always expect. Almost has a Dunkel hue. Cloudy, and the head is not as impressive as some in the style. In the Tucher Weizen glass it looks orange more than yellow.
Standard yeast, clove and banana/bubble gum nose with the emphasis on the yeast as far as my nose can tell. Carbonation is fine (in terms of bubble size) but active. Mouthfeel fairly standard.
The tastes are toward the hard, acidic esters rather than the softer banana and pineapple end of of the spectrum. I get apples with a little bit of cider character. Finish is short and brisk.
I feel that this beer has changed in character somewhat over the years. I have no idea if there are new components to the beer or the brewing process, but it seems a little harder and more clinical than I once remember it. Of course, nostalgia and memory are strange things, so perhaps not. Either way I am less inclined to drink this than I once was.
Despite that, it's clean, refreshing and very drinkable so not too much to complain about."

Quintessential West Coast IPA in terms of appearance, nose and taste - NEVER has a beer been more aptly named!
Clouded orange body with a high rocky head with good retention and excellent lace.
Quintessential (there simply isn't a better word to use) citrus hop nose and grapefruit resinous hop bite. Drinks smoothly and easily, but you have to be in the mood for west coast hops to enjoy this fully. If for any reason you are not a fan of the sub-style then I would stay away completely. Residual sweetness and slightly cloying in the aftertaste and finish.
In short, ""it does what it says on the can""!"

Batch NR 98. Oct 07, Oct 10.
Worry lack of ""pop"" on opening and this lack of carbonation is overwhelming experience. It is so severe I am wondering if this is a problem with the bottle or the batch. Anyway, there's obviously no way of knowing. Lack of carbonation means little head and no lace.
Dark coke-like pour which is largely lifeless. Nose is very nice with some very rich, light alcohol, sherry filled character. it promises much, but ultimately the taste is not as good as the smell would suggest. Nose is the best part of this beer.
Tastes are quite licorice like with some dark, dark treacle. Some charcoal residual bitterness and a smokey, burned finish. Although the tastes do not reach the promise of the nose they are still fine, but the real problem here is the lack of carbonation and the slightly thin mouthfeel. Aftertaste takes on a yeasty, Marmite note!
Ultimately very disappointing for me, and expenive to boot. Not really happy with this one, HaandBryggeriet can do much better."

Hazed ornage appearance with a decent head and some lace.
Lots of sweetness in the nose and the initial tastes. Really quite fruity with plenty of juicy, semi-hard fruits present. Some apple character but also pears and other esters.
Well balanced beer but the malts obvious take the lead. Nicely put together and tasty. well rounded in the mouth and the finish has a dose of pineapple ester to round it out.
Not quite as sharp to look a as one might think for a Marzen, but drinks better than the appearance would initially suggest.
I enjoyed it and could see myself going back for a few of thiese next season."

Lovely chestnut brown/mahogany clarity on the pour with a small but well retained head and some lovely lace - exactly what I am looking for in an Amber.
Nose, tastes and mouthfeel link very nicely to deliver a pretty good example of the style. Simple balance with some caramel malts and a lingering finish. The finish is what I like most about this beer. It's sweet and clean and leaves a sense of satisfaction.
Very pleased with the efficient simplicity of this brew. It's not mind blowing but it does ""exactly what it says on the can"" - good stuff."

This one goes into the Duvel tulip with a HUGE, rocky head with wonderful retention and lace. Honey oranged cloudy body with some floaties complete the picture. Light floral hops in the nose; nothing overpowering.
Carbonation seems low on the pour, but it has a little prickly nature in the mouth.
This beer is definitely almost crossing over into Belgian IPA country for me. A distinct, orange peel marmalade note is the predominant flavor and it's delcious. Tart and bitter nature lingers in the finish. The sweet and sour notes intensify as the beer warms.
Well, it certainly lives up to its name, and the spice nature of the usual Wit is replaced by a warming alcohol note, a hoppy bitter edge and some interesting orange peel tartness. Quite a beer, and another, typically innovative effort from Mikkeller. Tasty."

A still, ""black as night"" pour with no head. I suspect that this is just due to the inability of the barstaff to pour a beer, but ho hum this is Taco mac and this is what you get - suck it up!
Obviously I wanted to allow this to warm some and when one does one is not disappointed. As is often the case with Shmaltz we get a very complex beer in the nose and the tastes. Layer after layer of hops and rich, rich malts compete for attention. It's a pretty sweet beer but it comes together nicely. Alcohol is extremely well hidden. It's there, but by no means in your face. Compolex prune and brown sugar notes dominante in a good way.
Finishes with more rich malt layers that coat the tongue and provide a delicious backdrop to enjoy the beer.
A sipper and a classic fireside end to the evening. Delicious, these guys don't do much wrong."

Surprised at the pour into the Tucher Weizen glass reveals such a light colored beer. A real butterscotch colored affair with a cloudiness and head that reminds me of a Hefe. A lot lighter than I was expecting.
After the relative initial shock of the pour things get right back into style quickly, and with some presence. Everything is there for the style with mild bananas and the really strong ester/alcohol notes present in the nose and the tastes. Very pronounced edge to the brew with some lovely alcohol laden pineapple, pear and spongy character. Alcohol warms but is beautifully in check and balanced.
Delicious and very drinkable but I bet this could kick your ass! Respect all 'round."

Poured into the Ommegang chalice this appears just about jet black. Even relatively strong light fails to reveal much in the way of red or brown highlights. Head settles to give a thin film of mocha on the surface and in the ring around the edge.
Nose is a mild espresso that is not overwhelming. Gentle but strong coffee beans.
The mild coffee persists in the tastes but this is accompanied by a very warm alcohol. It's obviously there, but at the same time it is not that hot a beer.
Quite light in the mouth considering all that's going on, the beer still coats the tongue nicely. As the beer drinks and warms, the beer loses a little of its smoothness and the beer seems a little harsher. Finishes with a tougher alcohol edge than seemed present earlier."

Pour is an impressive slightly clouded orange with a big, ice-cream like head. A small amount of lace.
Nose reveals little other than some simple, grassy hops. Not much there.
Tastes continues the organic notes followed by some residual sweetness and a simple, refreshing ending. A little mild lemon and spice and good balance.
Straightforward and well made beer but ultimately uneventful. In a wicked Texas summer I'd be reaching for it in a heartbeat."

12 oz single from Tower on Buford.
Clouded yellow appearance with a nice, bubbly soapy head and some lace to go along with it. Carbonation is low. Soft mouthfeel with a mild citrus grapefruit taste being the overwhelming sensation. The grapefruit sensation is really strong for me, and it's not a hop bitterness that I often use the grapefruit explanation for.
Finishes with a little dry character.

Extraordinary color (or more accurately a LACK of color) on the pour. It is transparent to the point of being crystal clear with a pale golden hue.
Good lace on the glass from an unimpressive head.
Mouthfeel is as one would expect for the style, as is the bitterness in the finish. Outside of that it's a standard macro lager. Not really offensive but nothing of any great interest either.

Pretty much exactly what I expected which is a very good thing. 
The pour is excellent with a lovely orange amber body, a high head and some serious head retention and creamy, broken, dripping lace. Carbonation is just about perfect.
Rather than entering into a long description about the beer it's probably best to describe it in terms of styles. The American Pale Ale style has the potential to be bland, but this is hopped up enough to break that stranglehold of mediocrity. Even at these relatively low levels, the hops are still amped above the the level of an English Bitter, but in combo with the APA style it comes out to be a dry version of a typical English beer. Having read a lot about ths beer I figured that's what would happen. I had confidence mainly becasue of the quality of Bear Republic - they did not disappoint.
Finishes a little more bitter, a little more floral, a little more hoppy and a little drier than a malt based English bitter, but in terms of an American beer it comes really close. I like it a LOT, and I have to take what I can get here in the USA. It reminds me a little of a Courage Best bitter from the late 80's/early 90's with a bit of soap in the ending.
Drinkability for me is HUGE and if this were available to me on a regular basis I think it would be a staple."

12 oz single from Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA. ""Born On"" May 31 2008.
Pour yields a decent golden body but not much head. Some minimal lace - not the worst looking beer I've ever seen.
Grain based alcohol in the nose.
Lots of sweetness upfront from the honey element and it also has the effect of smoothing out the beer. Odd aftertaste that is not that attractive.
I don't really dislike this beer, but at the same time it's pretty average. The sweetness will be way too much for many, but for me it's not too bad.
I dunno, not nearly as bad I was anticipating and I could probably drink a couple of these. My guess is that the sweetness will simply be too much of a barrier for some."

Pour is a lacklustre, perfectly clear golden pour. The film of head that form on the surface of the beer is light and there is no lace.
Nose reveals a strong, sherry like liquor based aroma - I rather like it! It's the beer's strongest feature.
Tastes reflect the nose just for a second and then the beer reverts to an acidic, sharp and rather unpleasant atifical bitterness. Finishes dry and bitter with an aftertaste that is reminiscent of a really low quality sherry.
Some potential here, and it's difficult to know what the unique nature of the beer does to the tastes, but either way, even with my optimistic outlook it is hard to get through a single bottle of this brew."

I have lots of success with cheap singles from TJ's in the past, so I am usually happy to throw out a buck in the hope of finding an interesting shot.
Pale orange macro like pour with an alarming lack of carbonation, head and lace. Decent depth of color, but looks dead.
Nose is suprisingly bland and only has a hint of something ""pumpkiny"" or ""spicy"". VERY little there.
Tastes have a nasty macro lager underlying feel, but on top of that is a wickedly artificial cinnamon spice. It's actually not that offensive, but it does seem dreadfully ill at ease in the beer. If it is supposed to be pumpkin I don't get that.
Very thin mouthfeel here.
Well, after lots of good experiences with the $1 TJ specials, this one missed the mark. I stil have a decent record of finding some good value there though."

Bottle is a bit of a gusher. Poured into the Tucher 500 mL Weizen glass the beer forms a thin, slightly light looking head a top of the dark orange, clouded body. Lace is not really in the equation.
Nose and tastes are quite fruity with some acidic apple notes. The fruit notes are of the sweetened variety rather than the purer, unadulterated sharpness.
Body is a little light for me.
This is just a disappointing brew to me. There's a lack of depth, and although I do not mind the sweetness as such, for the style it seems to dull the clove, banana and other notes that I would like to witness. I just don't like it much. It lacks a certain zest, and some of the essentially Hefe character seems to be missing."

Pour, look, color, head and lace are all what you would expect, i.e. not much, but the beer is at least unoffensive and relatively clean. It lacks skunk and to me has a very attractive ABV. A clean bitterness in the finish completes the package and in the end I am not at all disappointed and if anything I feel a little better about the beer AFTER I drank it compared to before.
Look, it is what is, but if you keep expectations where they should be and accept it for what it is you should be relatively happy.

Trader Joe's Brewing Company,Josephs Brau Hopfest German Style Pilsner,,,German Pilsener,5.00%,bottle,1.8,2.5,2,1.5,3,1.5,11/15/2008,"$1.00, 12 oz single from Trader Joe's, Atlanta, GA, USA. I've had plenty of success with TJ's and their cheap singles so I feel confident to at least give these cheap beers a shot.
Pour is decent in terms of color, but the head, lace and carbonation seems weak to me. The mouthfeel seems to have more carbonation that the look would suggest.
Nose has virtually nothing.
WOW, what an odd taste. A combination of corny sweetness and then a VERY strange, peppery bitterness.
As far as this being a Pilsner it is NOWHERE near the mark. It lacks a saaz bite and has no cleanliness at all. The beer is a bit of a mess and finishes very poorly with a bitter aftertaste too.
Awful Pilsner and a bad beer on top of that. Avoid; even for $1.00!"
Lagunitas Brewing Company,Lagunitas IPA,,,American IPA,6.20%,bottle,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,11/14/2008,"12oz single.
I've been drinking this for a few years now, time for a review.
Classic, light chill-hazed orange body with a small head but better lace than the head would suggest. 
Nose and tastes have that very distinctive Lagunitas hop sweetness that can be a little overwhelming. Very floral.
Sweetness lingers and there is a bit of an odd floral note in there too.
It's a very distinctive beer which requires a certain hankering for me before I reach for one. Floral fits the bill for the description in one word."
Stone Brewing Co.,Stone Cali-Belgique,,,Belgian IPA,6.90%,bottle,4.13,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,11/14/2008,"Interesting beer as is often the case with Stone.
22oz bomber with the usual Stone screen printed bottle. Thanks go out to BA PatronWizard for the chance to try this one. Stone special releases have not yet made it to GA.
Very nice, light golden pour with the very lightest hint of haze in the clear body. Head is above average but light but it does leave decent lace. Looks strong. Has a Tripel appearance.
Nose is hoppier and more IPAish than the beer drinks. The nose points more toward the West Coast IPA function of the name rather than the Belgian part.
Very smooth and really quite sweet. The hop edge only comes in at the end and in the aftertaste.
Very tasty and easy drinking and pulls off a very nice combo of styles in this relatively newly established hybrid slot."
Live Oak Brewing Company,Live Oak HefeWeizen,,,Hefeweizen,4.10%,growler,4.2,4,4,4,4,5,11/9/2008,"Many thanks go out to stopbarking for a chance to try this one. Half gallon, well sealed screw-top growler with the ""Draught House Bar and Brewpub"" advertised on the the clear glass in white lettering. From what I have read from the other reviews, this is because the brewery does not do growler fills so this beer has to be sourced at bars that do fill a growler. (As an aside, I WISH we had growler fills in GA).
The appearance of the beer within the growler is frankly a little uninspiring. A honey, old gold cloudy affair that looks pretty much exactly like four pints of unfiltered apple juice! Looks flat; I was a little concerned. However, the pour into the 500 mL Tucher Weizen glass induces the head and lace that I was expecting and makes the beer look so much better in the smaller volume.
Typical clove and mild spice in the nose. 
Not sure if I'm in the minority here, but the sum of the parts of this beer seems to be its strength. The flavors are not THAT exceptional (the usual mild clove and sweet bananas compete for your attention) but they do come together very well to give a very pleasant drinkability. Much smoother in the mouth and easier to drink than many of the style.
I really enjoyed the simplicity of this beer, and there is no doubt that it is very tasty and exceptionally drinkable, but #24 (at the time of writing) on the ""Best of BA"" list seems a little optimistic to me. Nevertheless well worth the effort of getting it (thanks Daniel), and I would recommend trying it."
Max Lager's American Grill & Brewery,Gimme Shelter Bock,,,Bock,11.00%,on-tap,4.38,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,11/9/2008,"Enjoyed two small glasses of this at Max Lager's yesterday.
Chill-hazed, dark brown appearance with hints of red clarity. Nice, well formed egg-shell head. Good retention and lace.
All the components of a solid bock are present with dominant (but balanced) malt backbone and a hint of hoppy bitterness. More like a double bock than a straight up bock to me.
I have no idea if the advertised ABV is correct, if it is it drinks WELL below that number and in that respect is a little dangerous!
All in all a very tasty and well balanced beer that I was impressed with. Add the charity component and you have a real winner IMO."
Max Lager's American Grill & Brewery,Max Oktoberfest,,,Märzen / Oktoberfest,?,on-tap,3.73,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,11/9/2008,"2008 version sampled 11/7/08.
Simple, clear and orangey/red/mid-brown pour with minimal head and lace. In fact, carbonation this low reminds me of a cask ale (a good thing).
This brew pretty much nails the style nicely. Good, sweet malts are supported with some subtle bitternes for balance. Nicely rounded in the mouth (which I always feel is an important feature of the Marzen type brews). According to the blurb this was brewed in the taditonal style in as much as it was made in March and then lagered until October. It shows. Nice caramel finish rounds the beer out rather well.
One of the better brews that Max does, I'd visit it again with pleasure."
HaandBryggeriet,Porter,,,American Porter,6.00%,bottle,4.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,11/8/2008,"Slightly confusing since this has a label that is different to the one in the BA database and has the words ""Norse Porter"" in addition to an ABV of 6.5% as opposed to 6.0%. For now, this review will sit here.
$8.99 for the 16.9 floz bottle from Arbor Place Beverage, Douglasville, GA, USA.
Pours HUGE at first giving a mountainous espresso like, fine bubbled head. This recedes quickly to leave (disappointingly) no lace. Nice fine and small mocha head sits atop the jet black, Guinness like body. Each new pour from the bottle leads to more enormous head and this gets a little annoying.
Nose is mildly roasty, but not much, and if anything is slightly acidic with some lactose notes. This gets repeated a little in the tastes, as the mild roast gives way to an almost milk stout like finish. A little hop bitterness in there too, but this is a pretty restrained beer in terms of bitterness.
Light mouthfeel as opposed to much creaminess. Finishes with more of that mild, lacto acidity.
A little atypical I would suggest, but nevertheless very tasty. Like a thin milk stout."
Margaritaville Brewing Co.,Landshark Lager,,,American Adjunct Lager,4.70%,bottle,1.53,2,1.5,1.5,2.5,1,11/7/2008,"Interestingly enough this is not only ""Premium lager quality"", but it is also an ""Island style lager""! WOW!
OK, golden urine appearance that is well carbonated but produces a terrible head and no lace. What a shocker! I smell nothing.
The taste is a slighly odd chlorinated one. Not sure if it is a citrus base or not but it seems a little lemony. Nasty corn and vegetable mix with an unpleasant aftertaste too.
To be brutally honest the most disappointing aspect for me is the PURE marketing nature of this brew. It's clearly manufactured and pitched to a particular demographic with no thought for the beer as beer. I should know better than to be disappointed by this fact, but there you go."
Mikkeller,Monk's Brew (Monk's Elixir),,,Quadrupel (Quad),10.00%,bottle,4.7,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,5,11/2/2008,"750 mL (plastic) corked, caged and silver foiled affair. Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA. I wish there was a real cork. This one has been in the cellar for a few months.
Dark brown pour with a lovely head and that classic, spotty, creamy quad lace on the surface of the beer and on the glass. Into the Ommegang chalice. 
Wow, what a combo. Close to perfect in terms of the style, taste, mouthfeel and nose. 
Creamy body with very light and fine carbonation. Nose and tastes combine to give the magical touch of high alcohol, deep fig and date type fruits, alcoholic esters and light burn. Sherry after-notes linger and the beer pulls it all together in the aftertaste. It is possible that the hop presence is about a tenth of a notch above where it should be, but that would be typical of Mikkeller when they mimic styles from other countries. In some instances they have got that wrong, but here it works well and is so close to the original style that it matters little anyway.
It's a beer of Westvleteren 12 quality which should tell you all you need to know.
High drinkability and high quality are the main points here. I'd like to sip this one over a two hour period before dinner, in the Spring, outside a typical cafe in Bruges or Lille. Delicious."
Terrapin Beer Company,Terrapin SunRay Wheat Beer,,,Hefeweizen,4.50%,bottle,2.85,3,3,3,2.5,2.5,11/2/2008,"Very pleased to pick this one up as a 12 oz single from Mac's Midtown, Atlanta, GA, USA.
I did not want to buy the Terrapin mixed 12 pack just to try this (this is the only way this has been released so far) since the other beers in the pack are only OK and available all the time anyway. Mac's obviously split of few packs and put them on the singles shelf.
Hazy, orange/golden pour as expected and a disappointing head and lack of lace. Rather weak looking.
Nose and tastes have mild bananas but not much else. Authentic for the style, but lacks much depth and feels watery and lightweight to me.
Pretty weak overall offering from a brewery that can do better IMO.
VERY average."
Brouwerij Lindemans,Lindemans Gueuze,,,Gueuze,4.00%,bottle,4.08,3.5,3.5,4,4,5,11/1/2008,"I'm really not at all sure what is going on with the Gueuze from Lindemans in GA, since it used to be all over the place with the Cassis and the Peche etc., but of late (the last 18 months to two years or so) this seems to have all but disappeared form stores in GA. This is one of two bottles that I have rescued from a couple of relatively obscure stores in the last couple of years. One came from Showcase Beverage in Carrollton, GA, USA.
355 mL bottle, foiled, capped and corked. Dimpled champagne style mini green bottle - love the presentation.
Not an especially lively pop on opening, nor is the appearance stunning, but better follows. The body is a simple mid-orange with lots of floaties but not much carbonation.
The nose is more Saison like than anything else; plenty of mild funk but nothing extraordinary.
Musty notes greet the palate at first, but this is quickly followed by the usual Lindemans sweetness. A few lemon grass notes and some mild but simple acidity.
Interesting stuff as usual. I guess that most hardcore Lambic and Gueuze fans simply don't consider this to be much like the real McCoy, but even WITH the sweetness that is so characteristic of Lindemans, this comes across with a certain charm and authenticity. It's drinkability is HUGE especially since the style tempers some of the usual sugary notes.
Might not be hardcore, but I like it!"
Southern Tier Brewing Company,Big Red (Imperial Red),,,American Amber / Red Ale,9.50%,bottle,3.03,3.5,3,3,3,3,10/31/2008,"22oz bomber. Thanks go out to todprokp7 for the chance to try this one.
Very surprised by this. I was expecting much more of a hoppy (and importantly for the stlye) drier affair here, perhaps even something that resembled a DIPA. However what I got was much more reminiscemnt of an American Barleywine.
Alcohol is quite well hidden which is not necessarily a good thing. It means the alcohol creeps up on you a bit and leaves a warmth!
Decent lace above a cloudy copper body. Sweetness cuts across the brew in a slightly unbalanced manner with a wierd hoppy character that I'm not keen on. The beer is a bit of a malty mess with VERY ill-defined character.
Not my idea of an Amber and the product overal was very disappointing. Ill defined boundaries make this feel soupy and old. Less than impressive. I'd like an amber with better clarity and significantly better definition. A lower ABV would work well too."
Breckenridge Brewery,Autumn Ale,,,Old Ale,6.70%,bottle,3.83,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,10/29/2008,"12oz single from Total Wine, Kennesaw, GA, USA.
Old Ale? Not by any stretch of the imagination!
Decent dark brown pour with some ornage highlights at the edges. A pretty nice head straight out of the bottle, but retention and lace (although there) are not what it initially promised.
Nose reveals a little sweet nuttiness and some plenty of malts.
Mouthfeel is a little thin but the body and tastes are nicely balanced in a simple way. Although the alcohol is nicely hidden, I'd still think this beer would do better between 3 and 5% rather than up near 7%. Pretty smooth and well rounded with a small hop bite in the finish. Aftertaste is a typical, moreish linger well-balanced malt and hop merge.
Essentially this looks, tastes and drinks like an English Brown Ale to me.
Tasty, well worth a visit."
Terrapin Beer Company,Terrapin Gamma Ray,,,Wheatwine,11.00%,bottle,2.15,3,3,2,2,1.5,10/28/2008,"Having been asked to re-consider my review, I took another look at my notes and came up with the following adjustments.
Here we go with #3 in the Side Project series. Somewhat disappointed by the first two in the series so I hope that this is better.
A viscous looking pour that likes like a golden, honey colored Hefe. Small head and not much lace. Smells like a Hefe too. Slick mouthfeel. Some cloves in the nose. 
On to the taste. Medicinal wheats and a warming finish. Dry, alcoholic aftertastes. Quite sweet that I would not describe as honey based, but it's certainly sugary. The honey is more obvious in the appaearance in terms of color. 
Drinkability is very poor for me. In fact, half the bottle was a drain pour. I just don't want 11% beers in that quantity very often and the sweetness is just too much even for me, a person that enjoys sweet brews.
(Being VERY careful not let the following effect my review of THIS beer, I think it is a dreaful shame that Terrapin has not used the Side Project series to showcase a sessionable, simple bitter or at least something with a more reasonable ABV. that would be a refreshing change)."
Bernard Family Brewery,Bernard Cerne,,,Euro Dark Lager,5.00%,bottle,3.13,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,10/26/2008,"It's a little difficult work out if this is the correct beer, but I am pretty sure that it is. The label and bottle look identical except for the word ""Dark"" rather than ""Cerne"", but ABV etc. matches.
$2.99 from Arbor Place Beverage, Douglasville, GA, USA for the 500 mL flip top offering.
Pretty much a standard mediocre Czech dark beer. Probably doesn't travel very well and I'd imagine that closer to the source this would be a much better bet.
Standard dark, but thinnish pour and a small, spotty but creamy head. Malt based which is easy drinking but the beer is a little light in the mouth.
OK, but nothing else to report."
Brasserie Dupont sprl,Moinette Blond,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,8.50%,bottle,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,10/26/2008,"330 mL bottle from Tower on Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA. $3.95.
Surprised to see that I had not reviewed this before now.
Pour in one go into the Ommegang chalice. Body is a honey colored orange with a distinct coudiness present and some serious floaties - typical for the bottle conditioning. Thin, soapy film forms on the surface of the brew. Looks solid.
Honey and medicinal yeasts cut across the nose.
Similar taste profile, but it is sweeter than the nose would otherwise suggest. Residual sweetness lingers in the finish, as does a slight white pepper note that was not present in the aroma. Honey sweetness too.
There is a touch of sweetened grapefruit juice in the mix too.
Not really a ""clean"" Belgian Pale, in as much as there is a LOT going on here. I prefer a simplier approach both in terms of appearance, and tastes and I prefer a cleaner alcohol edge in this style."
Kona Brewing Company,Pipeline Porter,,,American Porter,5.40%,on-tap,4.78,4.5,5,5,4,4.5,10/26/2008,"On tap at the Austell Taco Mac, East West Connector, Austell, GA, USA.
WOW! What a pleasant surprise. Delighted.
Jet black body - exceptional. Small, perfectly formed head, this looks very reminiscent of a Guinness. Lace is good.
Nose is exceptional too. A beautiful, rich coffee-laden experience that is very memorable and reminiscent of a much more expensive beer.
Mouthfeel and tastes are equally memorable with a paradoxical cacophany of coffee creaminess and porter satisfaction coming together to produce a near perfect beer. Honestly the most interesting and tasty beer that I have drunk in some time.
Moreish and satisfying with a happy level of drinkability, what a brilliant beer."
Left Hand Brewing Company,Terra-Rye'ZD Black Rye Lager,,,Rye Beer,6.60%,bottle,3.15,4.5,4,2.5,4,3,10/26/2008,"$7.99 form Green's on Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA. 22oz bomber.
Pour is impressive with a high, towering tan head and nice ruby red, highlighted black/brown body. Lace is fantastic; sticky, copious and thick. So far so good.
Bags of great malts in the nose that a coupled with a sweet, cereal (oat-like) note. Reminds me of an oatmeal stout.
Mouthfeel is also very nice with smooth, fine carbonation rolling easily across the tongue. Creamy nature. Again, almost stout like.
Sweet, nutty start but then BANG the rye and hop bitterness crashes in, in a non-too subtle manner. It renders the beer intensely bitter in the finish and aftertaste in a way that one was not expecting up to that point. It REALLY bites hard - too hard for me. It gives an unpleasant burned note and it badly unbalances the brew.
The vicious bitterness at the back end of this beer destroys the drinkability for me, and it makes the beer almost completely different in the two halves of the drink. Odd."
Weyerbacher Brewing Co.,Thirteen,,,American Double / Imperial Stout,13.60%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,10/26/2008,"I bought three bottles of this when it first hit the GA shelves a few months ago, just getting around to opening one this evening.
22 oz bottle, $6.99 across the board in Atlanta, GA, USA.
The Weyerbacher anniversary series has a mixed reputation. Often described as being too big for their own good, they have been reported as muddled, difficult to drink and generally poorly balanced so I'm approaching this with a little trepidation and relatively no expectations. At close to 14.0% ABV, there is plenty of potential for a messy, difficult brew to say the least. We'll see.
Poured into the Terrapin 22 oz snifter in small doses, there are no surprises in the appearance. Jet black with an inky viscosity. Head is very small, lace hardly present. A few spots of coffee mocha film and swirls atop the ruby red highlighted body.
Nose is mainly a sinus clearing alcohol bomb, but despite its obvious nature, it is not horribly overpowering in the taste.
Tastes reflect the nose. It's alcohol rich, but it's drinkable. Don't get me wrong, the heat IS there but it is smoother than one would think it would be. Bitterness is in check, this reminds me of a fine Scotch. The burn is mild but definitely there! Not shocking. To say that the alcohol is ""well hidden"" would be a stretch, but it does seem manageable to me. Not an easy feat to achieve with such a massive brew.
I do not find this particularly complex just very a big alcohol bomb. Having said that, it is MUCH better than I expected. Age on this will be very interesting."
Jolly Pumpkin Artisan Ales,E. S. Bam,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,4.70%,bottle,2.85,3,3.5,3,2.5,2,10/25/2008,"750 mL bottle from Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA. Batch 278.
I'm always in two minds about JP; I generally like the beers that they brew AS LONG AS the style fits the funk. When I get a ""stout"" for example that has funk, then I'm annoyed. For that reason I am hoping that this beer will be a beer that I feel good about.
Decent gunsmoke on opening and some serious head. In the Terrapin snifter the rocky, snow-capped head and lace is gorgeous, but the body is MUCH darker than I was expecting. I was hoping for a golden body, but I get dirty brown Dubbel body - not that attractive.
Very typical for the JP series, but not very subtle or clever. Sour notes destroy much of the milder funk that should really accompany this style, and the dry puckering nature of the brew ties everything else up. Sourness is added to with a drying bitterness that does nothing for me. Hops fit awkwardly into the equation and the mouthfeel is thin. It grows on me a LITTLE bit as it warms, but to be honest it still fails to impress.
I dunno, another JP beer that uses an inordinate amount of sourness to eclipse the more subtle notes that should/could be present. Not much to say other than another opportunity missed. Shame."
RJ Rockers Brewing Co.,Bell Ringer,,,American Strong Ale,8.50%,on-tap,4.03,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,10/24/2008,"I'd seen these bottles around the ATL for weeks now and decided to dive in finally at the Taco Mac on the East West connector, Austell, GA, USA.
16oz draft pour. $4.75.
Viscous orange pour with little carbonation and little head. Lace is scant too which is fair enough considering the ABV.
Light hops in the nose that are not overpowering. Not at all cloying in the mouth, in fact rather light.
Interesting tastes. Viscous sugar is there amongst the alcohol and hop base, but to my great surprise and delight the whole thing drinks very lightly. Not a typical DIPA; more like a DIPA ""lite""!!
Very tasty and surprisingly easy to drink for the style. Nice."
Uinta Brewing Company,Angler's Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),5.80%,bottle,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,10/24/2008,"Interesting one this.
This had been kicking around a couple of stores in Atlanta for a while, and it had been in a couple of bars for a while but I had passed it up for a long time. However, I pop into the Midway in East Atlanta for a quick beer and there it is in the cooler. I thought it may have been hanging around for a while, but when I checked the bottle it had a 06/2008 bottled on date - well within acceptable times. Grabbed one.
Darker than expected pour from the 12oz bottle into the Allagash flute. Nice head, but it fades quickly. A little lace.
This is a surprising beer because it has an odd, American Barleywine taste to it. Hoppy and alcoholic without being too hoppy and too alcoholic! Pretty complex I thought. Not really my cup of tea but I think I would try it again and say it was worth trying. Interesting."
Magic Hat Brewing Company,Jinx,,,Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy,6.90%,bottle,4,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,10/23/2008,"12oz single from Total Wine, Kennesaw, GA, USA. May have been as high as $1.99 for the bottle.
Notched as being best before Jan '09.
Wee Heavy???
Significantly more of an orange/amber body than the style would normally suggest. Decent head and some lace. Lacks the typical dark notes for the style.
Surprisingly, a fruity, light nose.
The tastes are really fruity and have a crisp note about them and a nice acidity. Sharp tasting, and a nicely balanced beer.
I really like this, but to call it a Scotch Ale/Wee Heavy is a stretch to say the least. It's sweet, malty and above all fruity and to me it almost seems like a fruit beer. It has sufficient grapefruit bitterness in the finish to suggest that fruit, SPECIFICALLY!
Nice, odd, drinkable and tasty. Not sure what it is, but I like it!"
Allagash Brewing Company,Allagash Fluxus 2008,,,Witbier,8.70%,bottle,3.53,4,4,3.5,3.5,3,10/19/2008,"Mac's midtown, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Until recently I didn't realize that Fluxus was going to be a different beer from year to year; I assume that it is, since this is obviously a major departure from the same beer from last year.
750 mL corked & caged with a nice pop on opening and plenty of gunsmoke. Into the Sam Adams ""speciality"" glass. 8.6% on the label, 8.7% in the BA database?
Honey orange body, slightly hazed and a small but decent head. Lace is light, but dense. 
Nose and tastes match well with plenty of honey, orange and mild pepper/spice. Some banana. Finish culminates in more bitterness than the earlier part of the beer would have suggested. Quite floral and the alcohol is present both in terms of a heavy mouthfeel and a little burn in the finish. Mixed bag & complex.
I like the taste, but the slightly syrupy mouthfeel combined with the strong tastes make this a beer that is not easy to drink quickly or in quantity. Add the ABV into the equation and this is a bit of a task. It would be best shared and better with the alcohol taken down a few notches - not much chance of that in the USA!
Very tasty, but this is going to be a beer that not everyone will enjoy. A bit of a odd-ball. A floral (OK), but heavy (not OK) Wit. It's a bit of a mystery and a strange beast. The worlds first ""Imperial Wit""? If so, another style we can do without."
BFM Brasserie Des Franches-Montagnes,La Madragore,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,8.00%,on-tap,1.78,3.5,1.5,2,2,1,10/19/2008,"Draft, Brick Store, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pours with the look of an RIS. Much thinner though.
Lactic, sour notes hit the nose and the combination of that and the thin mothfeel make this one a non-starter for me. Nasty, lacklustre effort that has a sour milk note. This would be bad enough if it were some kind of stout but to put this in a Belgian Strong Dark category is a travesty. Acidic and tasteless.
Another really disappointing beer from this stable. Avoid."
Tooheys Brewing,Tooheys New,,,American Adjunct Lager,4.60%,bottle,3.3,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,10/19/2008,"Well, it is what it is. Keep expectations low and you'll not be disappointed IMO.
Purchased as a single from Total Wine in Kennesaw, GA, USA. $1.99 I think.
375 mL bottle, semi-stubbie appearance. I like the label and colors.
Drank a lot of Tooheys (amongst others) on my visit to Australia back in the early 90's and this is really a nostalgia purchase for me. 
Appearance is good with a nice head, decent retention and surprisingly good lace. Mid-level carbonation and golden clarity; good looker.
Sweet, corny nose but not offensive. Above average for the style I would say.
Tastes are pretty sweet, malt based and largely without hop presence except for a tiny bitterness waaaay back in the finish. Not much, but about standard for the style.
Easy drinking, simple macro style offering that in Australian (or Georgian) heat would do the job. Expect little and you'll be happy, it took me back and I enjoyed the experience."
Twain's Billiards and Tap,Twain's Honest Lender Imperial Brown,,,American Brown Ale,7.50%,on-tap,3.83,4.5,4,4,4,3,10/19/2008,"Crystal clear pour with a solid head and nice lace & retention; this looks very good.
Tasty malts are the order of the day (as they should be for a brown ale), and surprisingly (becasue this is categorized as an AMERICAN brown) the hops are reserved. Don't get me wrong, I MUCH prefer toned down hops in my brown ales since it make sense to have a brown with malts being the dominant character, but American browns usually do exactly the opposite - this one doesn't. Couple the fact that this has the word ""Imperial"" in the name, and you have a surprising lack of bitterness. GOOD! Of course to me it was infinitely better this way than as a ""hopped-up"" brown ale.
Despite the confusion of the styling, name and finally the tastes, it all shook down to being a very enjoyable, nutty experience. Just a TERRIBLE shame that it wasn't 3-4% rather than 7-8%! Brown ales ought to be a great opportunity to give us a truly sessionable beer, but for the bazillionth time the boat is missed - SUCH a shame, and very tiresome. As a result, I marked the drinkability of this very tasty beer down.
So close to pulling off a great beer, like so many others it ultimately falls slightly short - ho hum. I suggest calling it an English Brown, taking the word ""Imperial"" out of the name and halving the ABV - then we might have a close to perfect beer."
Tyranena Brewing Company,Devil Over A Barrel - Bourbon Barrel-Aged Coffee Imperial Oatmeal Porter,,,American Porter,8.00%,bottle,4.25,4,5,4,3.5,4.5,10/19/2008,"12oz bottle. Thanks go out to Unclejedi for the bottle as part of the Good, Bad & Ugly BIF.
Poured into the Terrapin 22oz snifter in three separate portions. No discernable head after a few moments following the agressive pour. A little spotty lace.
Nose is MASSIVE - full on coffee.
Didn't really get an enormous amount of Bourbon. The coffee seemed to overwhelm everything. A touch acidic and quite thin, even for a Porter. Coffee dominates.
Very drinkable considering the size and emphasis of the beer. I enjoyed this more than I thought I would. Tasty."

A little gunsmoke on opening and a slight burst of carbonation. Into the Duvel tulip it goes. Smells a bit ""old"".
Big head and very nice lace. Dark orange body.
Sweet, malty yeasty nose that reminds me of another brew that I just cannot put my finger on.
Tastes are a really earthy, rustic feel. In fact it seems to remind my of OLD beer. It's a bit odd and it really doesn't go down that well. Alcohol is well hidden but the other tasts don't add too much.
All in all a lttle disappointing. The earthy nature keeps coming through and there is little else. Obviously a few other characteristics such as a sherry, alcohol note but it still seems a little musty. Second half of the bottle became a Brat marinade!
A bit of let down for me, and lacks the dark, fig, raisin and rich fruit notes that should be linked to the style. I LOVE this style normally but this really wasn't that good."

500 mL bottle, standard Ayinger presentation.
Fine bubbled head tat lacks density on the pour. Into the Tucher Weizen glass.
Dark lemon body with disappointing (considering the style) lace and retention.
Nose and tastes have excellent banana and clove notes with the clove dominating the nose and the tastes opearting on a larger banana note. 
Simple, smooth, light carbonated feel in the mouth.
What can you say? Pretty much a classicly available, bottled version of the style. Solid. There it is."
Russian River Brewing Company,Blind Pig IPA,,,American IPA,6.10%,bottle,2.7,3.5,3,2.5,3,2.5,10/18/2008,"Split this 500 mL bottle with brickstoredave on a quiet Wednesday afternoon.
Pour is a light colored body with a soapy looking head and lace on top.
It's pretty simple to summarize this beer. VERY hoppy, very dry and very American in terms of ita ""American"" IPA style. Not really my cup of tea. The hops in the taste and nose are fairly astringent, and although not huge, they give a certain one-dimensionality to the beer. It's just not subtle and at the same time lacks complexity.
Frankly disappointing and another example of Russian River hype and lack of American subtlety for me. Ho hum."

Best Before END: Sept 05 2008 - better drink it by midnight on that day then! We're a little behind, but it's not the end of the world.
Very lively opening and pour into the Tucher Weizen glass. HIGH head that slips back nicely to give a super laced appearance. BIG ice-cream like head.
Pale lemon colored wheat and hazed body that hits some serious orange notes with the Autumnal, watered down GA sunlight.
It's a simple beer that lacks any large banana or clove notes, rather it creates an easy drinking, light but flavorful experience. Tasty with the flavor being stacked in the finish rather than earlier in the brew."

Golden body with excellent clarity. Surprisingly good carbonation considering ABV. Head is absent (possibly because of the crappy pour) but at this ABV unlikely to be very big anyway. Very light color for the style.
Nose is malty alcohol but even on warming it reveals little.
Certainly sugary sweet presence amongst the alcohol, but the beer manages to stay away from the viscous syrup that can plague this style and beers of this ABV. Pretty well balanced and a big treat to find a SN brew that isn't simply a hop laden IPA clone of some description.
Nice, and a good change of pace for SN."
Twain's Billiards and Tap,Twain's Tidy Soul Dunkelweiss,,,Dunkelweizen,6.80%,on-tap,4.13,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,10/15/2008,"Kinda interesting.
Like others have noted, a deep dark brown pour, but with surprising clarity for Dunkelweizen - must be filtered, because this is really clear. Head and lace are good, in keeping with the beers that Twains regularly produces.
Bubblegum and banana notes meet the nose and the tastes reflect pretty much exactly what I would expect in the style. Nose and tastes match well. Drinks a little easier and cleaner than some of its German forefathers.
An interesting beer that solves the problem of crappy looking Dunkelweizens! For that, I'll give it a ""thumbs-up"". Outside of that still a very solid brew."
Weyerbacher Brewing Co.,Autumn Fest,,,American Amber / Red Ale,5.40%,on-tap,3.68,3.5,3,4,3,4,10/14/2008,"Strange one, this.
Served as an 11oz pour at the Taco Mac on the East West Connector, Austell, Atlanta, GA, USA. Not sure why this is in the smaller pour since it is only a 6.1% beer, probably just Taco Mac screwing it up again - at least the glass isn't frozen in the smaller pour! $6.00 for the pour, so I think they've got it wrong again. Someone needs to educate this chain PROPERLY.
Great clarity on the pour with some fine carbonation. A real orangey/red/amber body. IF ONLY the pour were one that induced more head this would look great. Ho hum.
A little thin in the mouth both for the style and the time of year.
Sweeter than I was expect for an Amber brew, and the nose is muted because of the temperature that it is served at, this beer was tasty. Good malts hold a mild hop profile in place and it is one of those beers that is moreish. This maybe because of the small serving size.
I'd like to revisit this to be sure of my opinion."

Huge gusher - see other reviews for confimation.
Massive head as a result of the over-carbonation that looks solid - almost like ice-cream; flake anyone?? (English reference - remember a 99??!!) On the plus side, plenty of retention and lace.
Dark orange pour that is much less ""light"" than a classic Duvel pour.
Big, peppery, syrupy notes that make this more of a sipper than a quaffer. Lacks drinkability, but this is not a ""knock"" on the beer, rather just an observation. Really BIG yeast notes across the board in the nose and the taste. Not so much alcohol and spice here, much more about the bread flavors.
Top quality, full beer that is best drunk in smallish quantities. Tasty."
Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,Theobroma,,,Chile Beer,9.00%,bottle,3.73,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,10/13/2008,"Well, more interesting stuff from the boys at DFH. Glad to try just about everything that they put out.
Picked this one up at Arbor Place Beverage, Douglasville, GA, USA. Capped, 750 mL bottle. The label says 9% not 10% ABV as in the BA database at the time of writing. This one goes into the DFH palm glass.
Pour is a chill-hazed lightly sparkling orange with a small head and very little lace. Looks nice.
Aroma is a pretty nondescript, vegetal corn. Not much there at all.
A few peppery notes in the taste that add to the hop/bitterness sensation, but his beer still comes off as quite sweet. I don't really detect a ""chilli/chile"" note here, at least not in the way that a Rogue Chipolte comes down. There is a peppery spice note, but it's muted. Finish is quite sweet and sugary. It's a malty brew to say the least but somehow has a odd combination of flavors and sensations. There is a little more honey as the beer warms, especially in the taste as opposed to the nose. Some tomato like flavors too - odd.
Very easy to drink and the alcohol (whether 9 or 10) is virtually undetectable. Drinkability is perhaps the strongest suit here since for such a relatively high ABV beer it really disappears quickly!
Interesting I suppose from a brewing perspective, but ultimately not as interesting to drink as it was to read about or contemplate. Tasty but not outstanding IMO, but only DFH could put together a beer like this - more power to them, I for one appreciate their style!"

A recent entry to the ATL/GA market with the new wave of Full Sail beers. I like the stubbie presentation - old school and no pretence.
Pour has golden (better than macro) color that has serious depth. Good carbonation, decent head nice clarity. Looks solid.
Some vegetal nature in the nose, but it drinks MUCH cleaner than the nose would suggest. Simple, clean corn-like taste. Finish is clean.
Tidy beer. Expect little and you'll be happy. I enjoyed this."
Port Brewing Company / Pizza Port,Hop 15,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,10.00%,bottle,3.85,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,10/12/2008,"22 oz bottle from a recent trade. Apparently $5.99 from ""Vendome"".
Very typical (but good) example of the style. 
Over the years I've become increasingly tired of these beers (meaning this style) with their unrelenting hop bitterness and high alcohol content which has quite literally impeded their drinkability, BUT from time to time, I feel like going back to revisit them. It's REALLY important for me to go back to a solid version, because otherwise I will get frustrated quickly. Luckily this was one such ""good"" example.
Bright orange body with an initial high, pitted head, but this fades quickly to leave no lace to speak of. A tiny bit of foam on the surface of the beer but again not much to report. Some chill haze. There is good clarity in the initial pour, but a huge amount of yeast in the bottom of the bottle that makes the final pour look like soup!
Aroma and tastes match; huge hops with cloying sweetness and grapefruit bitterness. No easy drinking here, but to expect it would be foolish.
Finish has a metallic twang and more sweetness.
As expected this is not an easy beer to drink, and any beer that dictates to the drinker that more than one is a bad idea has limited appeal in my book, but nonetheless a solid example.
I dunno, IF you a looking for a beer that fits the style this would be a good one, but it's not an easy brew; then again, no one said it would be!"

Best before April 2008 notched on the label - it's now October 2008 but I doubt that it will matter much.
I MUCH prefer this beer as the old recipe i.e. as a Winter Warmer, and although I DO like the Scottish Ale style, I don't think that this beer is a good as it was prior to the recipe change.
Head is poor and does not last long. No lace.
Nice, dark copper color but average clarity. Malty tastes are still big, and to be honest it reminds me of the original beer but without the spices. A few dry sherry notes in the aftertaste.

Disappointing lack of gunsmoke and pop on opening - worrying.
Poured into the Tucher Weizen glass it looks better than I was expecting after the opening. I shouldn't have worried. Beautiful clouded, old-fashioned lemonade pour with a high, pitted head. Lace is good. Nice.
Yeasty, mild citrus spice in the nose with the emphasis on the citrus. This gets reflected in the taste. Very light orange bitterness mixed in with high drinkability and a refreshingly low ABV. Not much spice or any coriander notes, the emphasis is more on the lemon side of things.
Impossible to put down in the Atlanta heat, this is a great beer for the masses and as a macro replacement. Crossover potential by the boatload."

Appearance (at least in terms of the color) as expected (a dirty, turbid, clouded pour with some chill haze) which is not especially attractive. Head is better than expected and quite tall and pitted. On the other hand the head does not last long. No lace.
Aroma is solid - standard banana and clove notes.
Tastes - as expected. Reflects the aromas and then cuts in with a final acidity in the finish. Simple, straightforward drinking, not much to report. Just about worth $1, and nothing much to complain about in that regard."

""It says Kennebunkport Brewing Co., yet the beer (as per the label) is brewed by Pugsley Brewing LLC. It's tagged here as being from Federal Jack's and it is distributed through Trader Joe's.""
===***===
Poured into the Sweetwater Pils glass. Nice clarity and good carbonation. Golden yellow. Nice appearance. 
Simple beer with a touch of fruit in the nose, but really drinks like a bitter, second rate pilsner. Some acidic fruit in the finish but not easy to distinguish as being Blueberry specific. An uneasy lavender like taste in the finish too.
Light and easy drinking but this is not exactly a stunning beer, rather a summer sipper best used as a macro sub."

As all have noted a bizzaro, Ribena colored body and a pink head. Head hangs around a little but not much lace. HAS to get a ""5"" for appearance (exceptional), not necessarily for the right reasons - this must be pure food coloring, isn't it????
Grainy, vegetal, macro bitterness in the nose.
Also as others have noted, the color does tend to obscure tastes a little - odd, but it does. The brain plays tricks. As you look at the beer you expected a lager & black(currant) taste.
Some dry character and some metallic bitterness. DEFINITELY plenty of lager notes too. Cracker dry notes. Not really a hop bitterness rather a metallic coinage taste.
Easy drinking and not offensive are probably the best things I can say about this. Shmaltz is a better brewer than this would suggest."
"Anheuser-Busch, Inc.",Budweiser American Ale,,,American Amber / Red Ale,5.30%,bottle,2.58,3.5,3.5,2,2,3,10/5/2008,"Purchased this 12oz single as part of Mac's Midtown $8.99 mixed sixer, Atlanta, GA, USA. Glad to be able to stay non-committed to a brewer that hasn't earned my respect.
I like the presentation. There does seem to be a slightly different shape to the bottle (compared to the ""normal"" American 12oz bottle), and the old school classic red color is nice. Rightly or wrongly, I went ahead and included an element of my appearance score to reflect the good packaging.
Apparently AB has just defined a new style - the ""American Ale""! I doubt that BA or the BJCP will agree, and this seems well suited to the American Red/Amber category. It doesn't matter to me (because I am not American), but I would think that idea that AB is constantly attempting to monopolize the ""patriotic"" or ""American"" angle in its marketing might piss off the Americans amongst you - any thoughts out there on that?
Anyway, on to the beer. Decent copper color and good clarity. Head is decent at first but does fade. Some spotty froth but no lace. Carbonation seems lacking to me.
Malty nose with a touch of hop presence but very little.
Taste has some dry character and bitterness, but it seems thin and somewhat artificial. Almost has a plastic taste mixed in there too. The finish is quite harsh with a coinage metallic nature.
I dunno, MUCH better than many things that AB puts out, but I am confused as to why they cannot grab the bull by the horns and produce a really great beer. I guess that serious beers are just not part of the buying profile of their customer demographic. Like so many American icons it's all about marketing, the market share and the $ for these guys.

Following this thread; http://beeradvocate.com/forum/read/1567156#1568258
I wanted to say this;
Just to clarify, what I was saying in the review was NOT that Americans might get upset about the use of *word* ""American"" (as Todd pointed out, loads of American brewers do that, AND it seems reasonable), rather that Americans might be upset about the fact that AB/Bud seem to be hanging an increasing amount of their identity on being *THE* American beer; almost as if they are hijacking patriotism/the USA and associating those things with their product and their product ALONE. It seems to me that is what they are doing (by implying that other BMC products are somehow less American).
My point was, does that piss you (Americans) off? If the shoe were on the other foot it would piss me off.
I guess if you disagree with my analysis of the situation as a whole, then the question is a moot one."

====
22 oz bottle - striking in its appearance but I don't know if I like it or not. $9.99 from Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA so I am a little worried about the value - that's pricey for a bomber.
Right off the bat this is a VERY poor ""Dopplebock"" (IF indeed that is what it is supposed to be). If the beer IS just a hyped up version of Dead Guy, then I fail to see how it can change style dramatically. I'm sceptical to say the least.
Poured into the 22 oz Terrapin snifter it provides a big head, some chill haze and a amber/copper pour. Good lace.
BIG, malty nose.
Taste is a sort of weird combo between maltiness and an odd, harsh hop bomb. Strange. Odd caramel notes and this beer seems VERY oddly placed in the grand scheme of things. Dry Red ale type finish. Bitter aftertaste.
I don't get this at all, nor do I really care for this much. It seems to fall into the trap of trying to be all kinds of things and ends up being none of them. Just not good and a TERRIBLE ""Dopplebock"" by any stretch of the imagination."

Poured this baby into the Duvel tulip. Celebrating 400 years of settlement of Quebec City. Pale, honey orange body as expected. Large head that falls back to give spotty, light head.
Nose and tastes are as expected with simple Belgian yeast notes, mild alcohol and sweetness in the finish. Light medicinal/herbal notes too. Some non-ripe, crunchy pears in there too. 
This is a typical Belgian strong pale but also provides a lot of light drinking character. The sweetness IS there but it is not at ALL cloying or heavy. Easy to quaff.
Easy drinking amongst the spice (herbal) notes a delicious example of the style. I knew I would love this and I was not disappointed."

I took the cage off this bottle, got distracted with the kids, and about 10 minutes later the cork shot into the air with a huge explosion! Foam everywhere. A good sign I would say.
Lots of froth on the pour that leads to an orange body and thin head and lace.
Nose has an interesting combo of mild hops and Belgian yeast. The taste reflects that, and as such this seems like a quintessential version of the style. Bitterness in the back.
Not a huge fan of the Belgian IPA interpretations, frankly this style is generally better left to the masters - the English. Anyway, it tends to impart a somewhat medicinal note to the beer.
Body is light, which is OK as it adds to the drinkability.
Finish has a dry note and some more herbal medicine.
A decent change of pace and a good example of the style just not really my cup of tea. I'm not against these beers just find them a bit of a non-descript halfway house that sits between two stools."

Nice, light chestnut color, but to be honest it looks a little thin and the head, retention and lace are disappointing.

Good brew but put it in the cask and you have an infinitely different and better beer. I'd love to try this closer to the source."

On to the review for Shuttle.
Again, surprisingly good head, retention and lace. Body is a dark brown/garnet with some good red highlights scattered in there too. Super sweet nose.
Malt base here is strong (as expected) and it lays the ground work for a dryish hop background. Some mild nuttiness that finishes with an extra touch of dry character in the back. Finish re-invigorates the malt. Wow! Tasty. It's really quite sweet into the mix as well which crept up on me.
Very moreish beer and for that alone the drinkability for me is an easy ""5"". On reflection it is sweeter than I originally thought.
Nice example of the style, good stuff."

I didn't have huge hopes for this but as sometimes is the case, it did really nicely.
Very attractive orangey amber pour with a really nice head and a dense looking head. Good retention and carbonation. Nice.
Very light sweet malts and spices in the nose with some simple pumpkin notes as well.
Easy drinking that reminds me of a Sam Adams O'fest. The pumpkin spice notes are not really very noticeable at all, not at least until the finish.
Mouthfeel is light and refreshing and very enjoyable.
Drinkability is high, due in no small part to the THANKFULLY low ABV - what a massively refreshing change in the US.
I enjoyed this very much. Not spectacular, but refreshingly simple."

On to the review for Double Century.
Very light colored pour which at first has me worried that this s really a Golden Ale rather than a Bitter. One whiff of the hop combo in the nose leads me to believe that we have something more substantial here. Nice golden color.
Surprisingly well carbonated and a better than average head and some really good lace.
Lovely malt backbone supports a dry beer than finishes long and with surprisingly delicacy. The hops are sturdy but light. Almost floral in their nature, they dance gently on the tongue. Smooth bitterness completes the package. This is actually a pretty hoppy beer, but American palates will generally NOT agree. The understanding and role of the hop in craft brewing has shifted so far to one extreme on this side of the pond, that beer like this no longer register on many peoples taste range. No matter, those that know will appreciate the quality product that this and will enjoy it and will see the hoppy nature of the brew.
Well crafted, balanced, tasty and a better than expected average beer of its type. I'd LOVE to taste this on cask, it would probably be close to ""5's"" across the board."
Brouwerij Het Anker,Cuvée Van Der Keizer Rood (Red),,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,10.00%,bottle,4.83,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,9/28/2008,"Here we go with a ""new"" (2008) version of the Keizer. The older, dark version is one of my favorite brews of all time so the expectations are very high - we'll see.
750 mL corked and caged bottle from Green's on Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA. Opens with a stunning pop and some white gun smoke - impressive start.
Typical, well carbonated pour with lots of fine bubbles. Obviously this fades, but still leaves impressive lace and thin, fine head across the surface. The head is a little better than ""spotty"" and is about as good as one can expect for a beer of this style and ABV.
Great honey, gold body with continued fine and persistent carbonation.
Nose is essentially exactly as I would expect; an alcohol soaked, Belgian yeast based brew.
This is a simple beer to describe because it is the quintessential example of the style. I LOVE it when this happens. Alcohol, Belgian yeast and Belgian candy all come together in a pleasing package with a pleasing dry almost champagne like character to finish the job. Interspersed is a collection of mild, white pepper bitterness. Again, impressive. It maintains the creaminess of the mouthfeel despite the relative high carbonation.
Drinkability is off the charts for me, and part of that is the alcohol being so well hidden - don't get me wrong, its still there, but nowhere near the advertised 10%
If you don't like this then you just don't like the style - period."
Daniel Thwaites Brewery PLC,Wainwright,,,English Bitter,4.10%,bottle,3.35,3,3.5,3,3.5,4,9/28/2008,"Well, interesting stuff. This, along with Shuttle, Bomber and Double Century have recently made it to the US in 500 mL bottles. The presentation looks good and some thought has gone into this.

Hardly any bottled beer of this type is drunk in England, so these are simply not the best rerprentations of these beers that you will ever get.
One of the infamous ""Golden Ales"". These beers had never been heard of in England until about three or four years ago. To my mind they are dilutions of real English Bitters that are a manufactured piece of marketing that is designed to capture a small part of the macro lager swigging crowd/market. From that point of view I am against them on principle.
Having said all of THAT, they DO generally offer a drinkable, refreshing and balanced low ABV option that is tasty. This beer is no excpetion and I think that my real objection is to the style description of ""English Bitter"" - if it were me, I'd create a separate style of ""English Golden Ales"".
In terms of taste and appearance it is what it is. Simple golden body with little head or lace. It's a very lightly hopped beer that has carbonation and other lager like character. Some decent, simple malts and it is unoffensive. That's just about the best I can say for it.
At the time of writing the only other review was that of the cask version and essentially my review and it are not comparable - these are two TOTALLY different brews in these different serving styles."
Sebago Brewing Company,Bass Ackwards Berryblue Ale,,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,4.00%,bottle,3.88,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,9/27/2008,"22 oz bottle from Josh as part of a recent trade - nice one, thanks man!
Surprisingly dark pour. I was expecting a blueberry wheat affair along the lines of a Sweetwater Blue. Instead I got an amber body and a decent head. In fact, on reflection this beer is basically purple in color and has a pink head! Odd! A bit like a lager and black (see England in the mid to late 80's for a full explanation of that).
Simple brew that holds up very nicely in its own category. Quite dry both upfront and in the finish which makes perfect sense when you consider the fruit content and its character.
Ultimately a pleasing, simple and low ABV brew that was very tasty. A nice change of pace and worth a try. Thank God for lower, sessionable ABV brews in the USA!!!"
Stone Brewing Co.,Stone 08.08.08 Vertical Epic Ale,,,Belgian IPA,8.60%,bottle,3.98,3.5,4,4,4,4,9/26/2008,"Many thanks to Pretzelcity for the excellent trade.
22 oz bottle with the typical Stone VE presentation.
Golden pour into the Duvel tulip. Very bright golden hue, but frankly a disappointing lack of head and lace. More head and lace would give it a better appearance score.
Aromas are a combination of medicinal hops and floral hop notes.
If I had to describe the taste in simple terms, I would say this is a Belgian Pale/Belgian IPA/ Tripel combo. Plenty of sweetness from the Tripel element, but also dry hop character cutting across the beer to give the Belgian IPA note. Add some typical Belgian yeast character and you have a wierd and wonderful combination.
Truly an amalgam of sensations and styles. 
Stone once again produces a beer that is worth talking about. I'd prefer a traditional Belgian Pale along the lines of an American Duvel, but nevertheless this is a difficult beer to ignore - I strongly suggest that you do NOT!"
The Duck-Rabbit Craft Brewery,Duck-Rabbit Wee Heavy Scotch Style Ale,,,Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy,8.00%,bottle,4.1,4,4.5,4,4,4,9/26/2008,"12oz bottle as a single from Green's on Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Lucky to get his one as a single. Greens has been doing a bit of this lately and I've been waiting on this particular beer for a LONG time (long before DR came to GA).
FWIW I love the metallic green color on the label.
The color is a deep garnet color that looks great. Head is a little disappointing since it fades quickly, but nevertheless it still has depth and plenty of color.
Some decent sherry and alcohol notes in the nose. More rich maltiness than I was expecting.
Big malts are the experience here (as they should be), followed by an alcohol finish and some dry character. Large, and not quite as smooth as it should be, the brew is a bit edgy. A surpisingly alcoholic notes (especially in the finish) which slightly takes the edge off the beer; it feels slightly too big for the style.
Frankly this is one of my favorite styles, but this version has an alcoholic edge that is just a little too big.
Close, but not quite great. Maybe this would benefit from some short term cellar time."
Avery Brewing Company,Ale To The Chief,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,8.80%,bottle,2.55,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,2,9/25/2008,"22oz bottle, gold foil on the neck.
Cloudy orange beer. Mid-level carbonation with a small amount of lace and a spotty, thin head.
Aroma is that of sweetish hops, perhaps even floral in their nature. It is not really aggressive.
A typically relatively unbalanced American DIPA. There is a nasty, dry and sweet combo in the hop presence, and a lack of malty backbone to hold the thing together.
Disappointing and not very good. Sharp, harsh and wandering bitterness in the finish. One and done here. In addition I think I've had my fill of these unbalanced, American DIPA beers.
Big, but not clever."
SweetWater Brewing Company,Sweetwater Motor Boat,,,Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB),5.60%,bottle,2.78,3,4,2.5,2,2.5,9/24/2008,"12oz bottle from a sixer from Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA. $7.49 for the sixer I think.
First beer that I have drunk in nearly six weeks!
Pour is a somewhat thin looking amber/reddish orange that looks surprisingly carbonated with lots of small bubbles rising. Head is thin and fades very quickly.
Aroma seems very strongly hop based.
Hops are upfront but fade quickly. There is a lack of malt backbone which makes this feel very one dimensional. It's particularly dry as well and essentially this drinks exactly like a thin, Irish red.
DREADFUL example of an ESB (and it's a crime that it is characterized as one), and on top of that not a very interesting beer either. It lacks body in the extreme and is nowhere near the malty monster than ANY kind of ESB should be. Disappointing that Sweetwater has done a bit of a half-assed job with this one."
Skinner's Brewery,Skinner's Betty Stogs Bitter,,,English Bitter,4.00%,cask,4.48,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,9/1/2008,"Deliciously sessionable, simple example of an English bitter. Summer 2007 from notes - somewhere in Cornwall!
Main characteristics include the biscuit malts, the smooth mouthfeel and the drinkability. This is the kind of beer that one thinks of as being typical of the refreshing, quaffable and moreish bitter of yesteryear.
Mid brown pour with a better than expected head considering the cask serving. Long, drawn out nose and aftertaste that match perfectly. Malts compete with one another in a gentle competetion for your senses. Subtle beyond belief, but this adds to the drinkability. Mild hop notes that are clean and citrus based complete the package.
A great example of the beer I love the most and the type of beer that seems impossible to find in the USA. It's their loss."
Cotleigh Brewery,Golden Seahawk,,,English Bitter,4.20%,cask,3.88,3.5,4,4,3,4,8/30/2008,"Another classic English bitter if not quite a classic in its own right. Cask offering at The Well House, Cathedral Yard, Exeter, Devon, England. Summer 2007 from notes. This was offered at the end of the Real Ale Festival at the pub the week before.
Very Pale, golden color almost yellow. Subtle flavors with honey sweet notes and a typical biscuit malt and Goldings combination (not sure if Goldings are used in this but it seems that way to me). Light, bitter aftertaste and finish. Slight citrus, but its pretty weak.
Simple beer that is tasty but leaves a litle to be desired in the mouthfeeel depart. Somewhat thin."
Princetown Breweries Limited,Princetown Jail Ale,,,English Bitter,4.80%,bottle,4.03,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,8/29/2008,"Quite surprised to see this one already in the database. Purchased from an independent, gourmet food store on the high street in Okehampton, Devon, England.
Very impressed with the color of the pour, and quite surprised at the depth and richness of the head and lace. More than I was expecting. Color is a distinct, fairly dark copper, and has nice clarity and good depth.
A simple malt based brew, typical of the style but also with (for an English beer of its type) a rather raised hop profile. Of course, the hops are more gentle, subtle and floral than one has become used to in the US, and for that it is a Godsend.
Finish is a little dry, but the malts seem to hold up well in terms of their length.
One of better brews that I drank on my most recent trip home, and one that I would look for (if not exactly actively seek out) again. Tasty."
Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),Samuel Smith's Organic Cherry Fruit Beer,,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,5.10%,bottle,4.08,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,8/21/2008,"Drunk at the The Citte of York on Holborn in summer 2007. Reviewed from notes.
I must admit that I initially bought this beer at the bar simply to try it as a novelty. At the time I hadn't been back to England in a very long time, and I was anxious to try as many beers that I knew I could get when I got back to the US as possible. I had low expectations, but they were handsomely exceeded.
Odd looking pour from the bottle, giving and almost brown, cloudy concoction. It reminded me of an unpasteurized cider. Almost dark bloody red. Head was minimal, lace scant. Heafty whiff of cherry essence as predicted.
Very drinkable as the combo of ripe cherries and mild alcohol combine to leave a very moreish experience. Finishes with a tart, puckering acidity that is almost wiped out immediately by a rush of sugar. Actually nicely balanced.
I dunno, fruit beer is strictly a novelty for me, but to be honest I enjoyed drinking this one."
Upland Brewing Company,Helios Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),?,bottle,2.03,2.5,2,2,2,2,8/20/2008,"Final beer from Upland that Penney brought back from Bloomington, IN, USA for me. Thanks! 12 oz bottle.
Orange body on the pour into the tulip glass produces a thin looking body that lacks presence. Good clarity, but lace and head are both very scant.
Poorly balanced pale ale for me that lacks depth. Almost watery. Acidic overtones that lead to mild heartburn on the way down and obviously reducing the drinkability quite alarmingly. Malts seem absent.
Some acidic like hops, but as for distninction, there is none. It's wet, but that may be it's best attribute. Not much need to visit this again, I might even prefer a cold macro over it - at least I would feel that the beer lived up to its billing."
Brouwerij Van Steenberge N.V.,Monk's Café Flemish Sour Red Ale,,,Flanders Oud Bruin,5.50%,bottle,3.05,4,3,3,3,3,8/18/2008,"Single, 11.2 fl oz bottle from Michael's in Marietta, GA, USA. I think that this is an oldish bottle, but no matter, age will probably treat this well.
Poured into the Terrapin snifter, this sits in the glass a still as a mill pond, looking like a slightly reddish coke. Zero head and lace. Looks suspiciously like a LARGE brandy in that glass!
Pretty much a classic example of he style. Strong acidic/vinegar notes along with a thinnish body and an almost completely flat mouthfeel. Taste is less aggressive than the nose would suggest.
As I expected - not a style that does much for me, but this is at least authentic."
Founders Brewing Company,Founders Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),5.40%,bottle,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,8/17/2008,"12 oz stubbie bottle - thanks to Penney from a recent trip to Bloomington, IN, USA.
Very large and high head in the Duvel tulip. Bone white on top of the cloudy, orange honey colored body. Attractive and holds up well.
It's ""Dry Hopped"", and ""dry"" & ""hopped"" are certainly apt descriptors of this beer. The beer has a mild bitterness but it is a very tannin like taste. Dry tea like finish is especialy strong.
Decent creamy mouthfeel, nice carbonation. Aftertaste repeats the dry, puckering effect but lacks much lingering bitterness.
Nice brew, simple but a little too dry for my tastes."

Pours a distinctly urine colored body with zero head and zero lace. Nose is a fruity alcohol with the emphasis on an acidic cider like angle.
Drinks in a similar fashion to the nose with trat acidity and a distinct, fresh, crisp grren apple like taste. Odd aftertaste completes the package.
Not bad, but it really goes to prove it isn't possible to make good beer without the correct ingredients. Nobody's ""fault"" as such, just a fact of life."

Pour is a very pale yellow wth some cloudy character. Lacks presence in terms of head and lace.
Sweet and slightly acidic. Even a little insipid. Medicinal nose. Cuts across the palate quite sharply and it quite abrasive. Lacks any significant body and is really quite watery and weak. If I'm drinking a Wit I want a significant herbal character and some chewy depth in the mouthfeel - this lacks them both.
One and done here."
"Lakefront Brewery, Inc.",Fuel Cafe (Coffee Flavored Stout),,,American Stout,5.90%,bottle,3.03,3.5,3,3,3,3,8/16/2008,"12 oz bottle as a single from Total Wine in Kennesaw, GA, USA.
Dark brown, almost black pour with a thin film of froth on the surface of the body but no lace in the glass. 
Instant Coffee nose (Nescafe) but a thin body a little lactose taste backing the whole thing up. Some bitterness in the finish. Ends dry.
Certainly coffee based, but it gets lost a bit in the mix. To compete in this league you need to be much higher ABV, and probably a limited release. There is no reason why this couldn't be a competitor, but for now it falls a little short and a little thin."
Three Floyds Brewing Co. / Brewery & Pub,Alpha King Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),6.50%,bottle,3.13,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,8/15/2008,"12 oz bottle from Bloomington, IN by way of Penney - many thanks!
Nice clarity in the dark orange body that has a good head initially and a decent head. However, the head fades quite quickly and leaves very little lace.
OK, it's called Alpha King for a reason, and there is not much subtlety in the nose or the tastes in this beer. Because of the enormous hop presence, this beer does drink MUCH more like an IPA than a ""Pale Ale"". Outside of the hop presence there is very little else EXCEPT the fairly large does of diacetyl. That combination seems to lead to a pretty one dimensional beer - it's not a bad beer, but it IS pretty one dimensional. The lack of subtlety and complexity surrounding this beer slightly surprises me given its high ranking in the BA top 100 - strange, perhaps some ""overrating"" going on here?
A bit slick in the mouth too. Anyway, big fresh pine hop notes that remind me of toilet cleaner aromas and you get the picture. Just an average beer for my money and that whole diacetyl thing really hurts this brew."
Upland Brewing Company,Dragonfly IPA,,,American IPA,6.00%,bottle,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,8/15/2008,"12 oz bottle from Bloomington, IN by way of Penney - many thanks.
I'd never heard of Upland, but I am always keen to try a fresh, local product so this brew was a welcome gift.
Slightly clouded, pale orange color with some nice carbonation. Head is small, but hangs around. Lace is not extensive but is recognizable.
Clean fresh and grassy floral hops greet the nose and the tasebuds - decent stuff. Decent bitterness in the finish and the malts seem rather well balanced.
Tasty offering and delighted to have tried it. Nice to try fresh beer that is purchased near the source of a local, small, independent brewery."

Golden body with decent carbonation into the Sweetwater Pils glass. Small head and a little lace. Body has very good color, and looks rich.
A little malt in the nose but it is not at all distinctive. 
Easy drinking, smooth body but lacks any kind of hop bite. In that respect a little disappointing. Clean and refreshing with a touch of bitterness in the finish, it's average all the way around in terms of taste.
A decent brew, and pretty good value, but as far as being memorable or outstanding in any way, it simply isn't and doesn't. The kind of beer that in the bottle I may not give another thought to, but perhaps a draft, fresher version would inspire me a little more."

Slightly strange beast this. It's been at Green's for a little while now, but in the $15 range it makes me a little wary so I was happy to be a recipient of brickstoredave's generosity for a sampling at the pub (these bottles did not sell well apparently and are on their way out of the rotation at the BS). Serious carbonation on opening with a real gusher going on for a few minutes. Mocha foam.
Dubbel pour (i.e. mid brown, cloudy and rather drab) with a small head and a little lace. This IS Dubbel ""like"", but it lacks the Belgian candy and yeast element to yield a rather odd brew. It sort of sits on my palate somewhere between a Brown Ale, a Dubbel and a Bock. All very odd. It has some residual sweetness and sugar that inserts the Bock thing for me.
I liked it better than I like most Dubbels since it seemed sweeter and less BLAH. It is certainly not a classic Belgian Dubbel by any stretch, and it seems to have a sugary note that repeats itelf in the finish too.
I was OK, but at $15 a bottle I'm out. Typically De Molen it terms of its odd character."

Well, it is what it is and this always confuses the Lambic landscape. Quite how one goes from a beer (or beers) that Lindemans puts out over to a typical Cantillon and call them both Lambics is always a bit of a mystery, but there you are.
Dark magenta pour with a pink head and some good carbonation. 
Aroma and tastes are all black cherries, and a nice, non-artificial one at that. Obviously this is crushingly sweet, and to be honest I really like it - many will hate it. A little tart i the finish which gives it the genuine cherry fruit note.
Very smooth.
There really isn't much more to be said about this other than it is just about the perfect girly, brunchy, deserty non-serious beer. The drinkability is off the charts AS LONG AS you are not offended by the sweetness."

Highland Brewing,Highland The Shining Rock Lager,,,Bock,6.00%,bottle,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,8/10/2008,"12 oz single from Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA. $1.50.
Superb color on the pour which I would describe as a deep burned orange color. Head is initially high but fades to not much. Lace is decent. If the head had lingered more I would have given this a 5 for appearance.
Definitely a Bock beer - there's just no mistaking that rich, malty goodness, but this has some other interesting elements. Firstly there seems to be a slightly peppery, spicy note in the finish. At first I mistook this for a bitter, alcohol twang but it seems to linger and as it does it adds credence to the ""spice"" theory! Quite odd. there is a richness to the mouthfeel that I think always comes with the best Bock beers and their malty density. Honey is there too.
Nose and the underlying tastes are all connected to the malt base and they are there in abundance, but this beer delivers something extra. I'm not at all sure exactly what it is, but it certainly adds to the experience.
A tasty beer without doubt, and worth seeking out."
Surly Brewing Company,Bender,,,American Brown Ale,5.10%,can,4.05,3,4,4,4,4.5,8/10/2008,"Can split with Dave at The Brick Store courtesy of arkhamresident - many thanks.
I *think* that this had the words ""Oatmeal Brown Ale"" on the can (whatever that is!)
Anyway, on to the beer. Disappointing lack of pop on opening the can and this turned out to be a theme running through the sampling. Rather lifeless and lacking in carbonation. Not a huge problem for the style, but it seemed so low that I began to notice it.
Simple brown pour that lacks much head at all, and doesn't offer any lace or life. 
Once you get past the somewhat shallow look, this is actually a very solid and tasty beer. Good malts support the mid-range hop bitterness and kick in to end nicely (as per the style). I like this beer becasue it does what all brown ales should - it gives a feeling of moreishness. That feeling that you get when you feel that you could just keep drinking these. Mellow, simple ABV and malt smoothness complete the picture.
Nice beer, I just wish there were more of these being produced in the USA."

Standard golden clarity on the pour into the Sweetwater Pils glass, with a steady but not large carbonation. In fact carbonation falls away rapidly to leave the beer feels very flat at the end of the brew.
Strange nose that sweet and veggie/grainy. Not especially attractive.
This is disappointing. It is not very clean at all (one of the chief attributes that I am looking for in a Pils), and it has a weird sweet/cardboard taste. Not clean in the finish either.
As I say, not at all exciting and in the final analysis even quite poor."

Not sure what to say about this really, but here you go;
Possibly the palest ""beer"" I have ever seen. The head on the pour is not bad, and there is even a touch of lace. Obviously the carbonation fades to absolutely nothing after a couple of minutes, but it was there when the can was cracked.
I dunno, this tastes like seltzer water to me. Flavored water with zero hop character and only a touch of sweet maltiness. I think that this is a beverage that is purely a marketing tool to get people to buy colored water.
Obviously not really a ""beer"" in the manner that most of us understand it, and this is an alcohol delivery system wrapped in a complicated marketing staregy. Worhtless."

Lifeless pour with a head that looks good for about one minute (rocky and leaves some lace) but then inexplicably fades to nothing. Pale golden color. Not the lightest beer I have ever seen but lacks any semblance of body. 
No distinctive tastes here AT ALL. In a blind taste I think I may mistake this for carbonated water. There is an impossibly light bitterness in the finish but essentially this is not beer as we understand it.
Rather sad, since this is obviously a beverage that is based upon marketing rather than brewing. Worthless."
Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,Sierra Nevada Anniversary Ale (2007-2009),,,American IPA,5.90%,bottle,3.65,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,8/9/2008,"To say that I have grown tired of SN may be an exaggeration, but I've been drinking less and less of their products recently. I've grown a touch wary of these somewhat bland and certainly unimaginative hop based pale ales that they turn out time and time again. There are about 9 or 10 beers that are close to identical - what's the point?
This has been in ATL for a long time but I had no interest in a sixer for the reasons above, so I bought this one as a 12 oz bottle at Taco Mac in Douglasville, GA, USA.
Pale orange pour from the 12 oz bottle. Good head and nice lace. Solid looker.
Nose is very simple - light hops with a stronger bitterness in the taste than the nose would initially suggest. Bitterness lingers for a moment before fading. Some malts hit on a delayed aftertaste that is almost gaseous like. Grassy.
Simple and solid brew but why so many beers that are essentially the SAME??"

Wasn't expecting too much from this, but I was glad to give it a whirl. Ultimately it did a little better than I thought it would.
Good clarity, a nice carbonation and a prety intense orange color meet the eye from the pour. Also it has a decent head, and some better than average lace. Looks nice.
Nose has plenty of sweetness and not a great deal else. Light malts.
Tastes are very easy on the taste buds. It has a SLIGHT diacetyl roundness, but a tthe same time remains pretty light, sweet and drinkable. Malts hold on until the end and then a squeezed out by a subtle, smple bitter twang in the finish.
Nothing special here, but I could drink a sixer over the course of a couple of days without too much difficulty."

Striking golden clarity on the pour into the Duvel tulip is accompanied by a large, fluffy head and some serious lace. It looks GREAT, but a little too ""clean"" for a BdG! It looks a LOT more like a Belgian Pale, or perhaps (because of the amazingly golden color) a Euro Strong Lager. Anyway, it looks GREAT but it also ""looks"" out of style (if that is possible). It looks almost identical to maltermaster420's avatar!
http://beeradvocate.com/user/profile/maltmaster420
Grainy sweetness meets the nose along with a ""strongish"" alcohol presence, but it seems in check and balanced.
Very smooth, Belgian Strong Pale sweet, alcohol presence, but it is a bit more alcohol based, and obviously a lot less Belgian in terms of yeast and candy content. Finishes with a light ""bitter"" element, but even this is sugar based.
EXACTLY the kind of beer I like to crack open on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday when I have time to savor it. A super beer with excellent drinkability. Tasty!"
Brouwerij Drie Fonteinen,Drie Fonteinen Oude Gueuze,,,Gueuze,6.00%,bottle,4.33,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,8/3/2008,"Greens on Buford - 750 mL corked & caged. SB15 on the cork, bottled on 11th December 2000. FWIW, this is listed on the bottle as 5%, not 6% as in the BA db.
Good pop on the removal of the cork, and a little white gun smoke. Poured into the Terrapin snifter, the color is a mid orange (Olde English marmalade color) with a decent 1/8th inch, fine bubbled head on the surface of the beer. A smidgen of lace.
Nice farmyard manure in the nose. Mouthfeel is a little more prickly that I was expecting with quite a high carbonation; ""fizzy"" may be an exaggeration, BUT putting ones ear to the beer reveals are pretty loud and noticeable ""crackle"".
Very clean, grapefruit like acidity upfront with some serious tartness. Unusually the sour notes do not linger much, and the beer ends cleanly to yield some yeast in the aftertaste.
It's definitely a beer for the experienced drinker rather than the novice, but having said that this is a very approachable beer for the style. I must admit I was expecting something much more aggressive and I was pleasantly surprised. I'm guessing that at 8 years old, this has been treated well by time, and when it was younger it may have had some of the traits that I was a little wary of. The aging process has taken this from the potentially harsh Gueuze to the edges of the more approachable Saison. Interesting and well worth a try."
Molson Breweries Of Canada. Ltd.,Carling Black Label,,,American Adjunct Lager,5.00%,can,2.1,2,2,2,2,2.5,8/2/2008,"This is a great example of why I feel the need to walk into nearly every single beer retail outlet that I ever pass - you just never, ever know what might be in there! Picked this can (as pictured on BA) up for 50 cents at Track One between East Point and West End on the less glamorous side of Atlanta, GA, USA. Good value - just!
OK, here's the deal. You could have knocked me over with a feather when I saw this can. Carling Black Label is a brand that I grew up with in 1970's (and also the early 80's) England. Not that I was drinking it, mind you, but it was a HUGE, HUGE beer at that time in the UK. I remember the jingle from the advert (commercial for you US BA's), and I remember the ""pump"" on the bars in pubs, and I remember the whole concept - just type ""Carling Black Label"" into a YouTube search and you'll find the classic, ""I bet he drinks Carling Black Label"", and ""Your best bet for a fuller flavor""! Happy memories...anyway, on to the beer...
Now, I'm not naive enough to know that this may be a completely different beer from years ago. What with mergers, buyouts, contract brewing, and general globalization, who the hell really knows what kind of relationship what is in the glass in front of me has to the draft versions of 1979 in England??
Pour is over carbonated with a very light head and some very thin, ugly lace. ""Body"" is one of the lightest colored I can remember seeing - ever! Head dies to give nothing, and you have a classic, low quality American macro lager sitting in front of you.
Just the usual in terms of taste and body. Thin, thin, thin, with some serious corn and veggie elements and the whole thing is horribly average even by macro lager terms.
Just about what I expected, but this did give me a massive blast of nostalgia, and a 50 cents a can I could not go wrong! Glad I came across this."

This one has been sitting in the DBF for a long time, but I am happy to report, that (as expected), this has aged beautifully. Notche (approx.) best before April 08.
Jet black pour and a huge, mocha head, this basically looks like a BIG RIS. (It lacks the depth of mouthfeel of a RIS, but outside of that it resembles one in many other ways). Head is beautifully maintained, creamy and produces some great lace.
Lots of roasted chocolate notes in the nose and taste. It does have a little hoppy edge that certainly makes it an ""American"" rather than an original Porter, but I can live with that (just!) VERY mild smoke, but smooth and clean - delicious!
If you are looking for a classic English porter, with a classic America twist (more hops) then this is a quintessential brew. Look no further. I'd prefer a creamier mouthfeel and less hops to bring it back to a ""real"" porter, but nevertheless this is a classic of a non-classic style."
Brouwerij Drie Fonteinen,Drie Fonteinen Oude Kriek,,,Lambic - Fruit,6.00%,bottle,3,3,3,3,3,3,8/1/2008,"$8.99 at Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA. 12.7 oz bottle corked (with that nasty, synthetic cork) and caged. Lot #02, bottled in December 2005. Label declares that this is good for at least 10 years after the bottling date.
As expected, very little ""pop"" on opening. Carbonation on the pour is nearly zero.
Poured into the Brasserie de l'Abbaye des Rocs chalice the beer has a dark magenta/blood red color that is completely opaque. Completely bereft of carbonation or head. 
Nose and taste lack much SPECIFIC cherry presence, rather they combine to yield an acidic/tart combination of ""fruitiness"" that lacks definition to me. Finishes with vinegar like acidity.
I dunno, even after years and years of drinking these Lambic beers, AND knowing exactly what to expect, AND understanding the whole Lambic ""thing"", I just don't find these beers especially drinkable. I am beginning to think it's a big con, along the lines of the Emperors new clothes! ;-). having said that, I think a lot of the problems with this particular beer could be erased with age. At less than three years old I think this is simply way too young."
De Scheldebrouwerij,Hansje Drinker,,,Tripel,9.00%,bottle,3.23,2.5,4,3,3.5,3,8/1/2008,"A Dutch Tripel? I have my doubts, let's see...
$3.95 for the 11.2 oz bottle form Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Nasty looking pour - dirty brown Dubbel appearance. Looks like dirty, ditch/dish water. Head is short lived and no lace in the Duvel tulip. Looks drab.
Big sweet Belgian candy notes and a touch of yeast complete the nose. The aroma is the best part of this beer.
Tastes are mild caramel with a little residual sweetness alongside some chewy malts. A little alcohol in the finish, but this drinks well below the advertised 9%.
Not really much of a Tripel in my book, all the way from the appearance to the taste. Way too ""muddy"" and ill-defined for me and for the style. Disappointing."
De Struise Brouwers,Black Albert,,,Russian Imperial Stout,13.00%,bottle,4.58,5,4.5,4.5,4,5,8/1/2008,"First off, enormous thanks go out to BA Delerium - an extraordinary generous gift from him to me. Chris, I owe you. A rare chance (these days) to get into a BA Top 100 beer; #28 currently and it's welcome!
The beer demands my full attention, so I pour the 330 mL bottle into the Terrapin 22 oz snifter (seems like the perfect glass) in three separate portions, I also pour a large glass of fresh, cold water alongside it and I settle down to enjoy the experience.
Jet black pour with an impressive initial head on pouring that settles to a dense, 1/4 inch, perfectly formed espresso like film across the surface of the beer.
The aroma hits me from about 18 inches away. The main smell is a very dark (plain), high cocoa percentage chocolate.
The beer starts with a fairly rich, alcohol laden, slight bitterness. The initial beauty of the brew is the way that is holds a delicious balance. It really prods at the edges of bitterness and high alcohol BUT at the same time it still manages to stay within acceptable boundaries - quite a feat, it treads a fine line AND pulls it off. Although the alcohol is there, in terms of 13% it's amazingly well-hidden. Some really tasty light acidic fruit in there as well. It's complex and very well balanced.
Halfway through the beer I grabbed a Black Forest Truffle - the perfect complement to this exceptional beer. A lovely brew that is smooth, very rich and perfectly balanced."
Florida Beer Company,Key West Sunset Ale,,,American Amber / Red Ale,?,bottle,2.78,2.5,2.5,3,3,2.5,7/31/2008,"12 oz single from Total Wine in Kennesaw, GA, USA.
Very pale, light orange pour with a light, bubbly smallish head and some lace. Looks light and though it won't have much body.
Some malts up front, but this is quickly followed by a dry, citrus hop finish. To be honest it tastes a little on the artificial side, almost as if hop essence has been added - rather odd.
Light body. Although this really isn't much of a beer, at least it has some bitterness that takes it beyond a nasty BMC macro lager so it might do in a pinch. Outside of that redeeming quality there is little else here - expect very little and you'll be OK."
Magic Hat Brewing Company,Odd Notion (Summer 08),,,English Dark Mild Ale,4.20%,bottle,3.4,3.5,3,3.5,2.5,4,7/31/2008,"12 oz bottle as part of the Magic Hat mixed 12 pack, Harris Teeter, Hilton Head Island, SC, USA. $12.99 for the pack along with #9, Circus Boy and Hocus Pocus.
What have we here? An English Dark Mild?? I doubt it, but we'll see.
Pour is good revealing a pretty decent head a little lace. Good clarity amongst the light mahoghony body.
The aroma gives very little away other than certain maltiness (which is a good thing for the style) but it fails to live up to much.
Tastes are relatively authentic for a ""mild type"" (not sure why we need to designate milds as dark and pale, every mild I EVER drank in England for years was always dark, but there you go). Light metallic malt and a subtle hoppy dry factor in the finish. Easy drinking and moreish, I enjoyed this.
All in all a decent beer, but too carbonated and too thin for the style. Doesn't help that it is bottled either - ho hum. Outside of that a decent stab at the style, and to be honest we see so few good examples of these types of beers (lower ABV and subtle hop malt combos) that I am just happy to see almost any version. I have to be happy with what I can get, and not to be too fussy."

I've had this a few times before, time to review it now. Declares itself as ""3/4 of a pint of Summer Ale"" on the label.
If you take Hocus Pocus for what it is - a light drinking summer time brew - then you'll enjoy it more.
A pale but golden pour with a decent head and some surpisingly good lace. Looks better that I remember it in the past!
Nose and tastes have some very light citrus and lemon grass notes, with a hint white pepper and a touch of orange. Everything is very subtle, which is perfect for the type of beer we are dealing with here, and as such is complements the light touch.
Easy drinking, a nice ABV and a perfect summer gulper, tasty and good value - what else can you ask for?"
Stevens Point Brewery,Augsburger Dark,,,Munich Dunkel Lager,?,bottle,3.08,3.5,2.5,3,3.5,3.5,7/31/2008,"12 oz single from Highland Beverage, Hiram, GA, USA. $1.39.
Dark brown pour with a mocha colored head that fades to a thin film but looks nice. 
Extremely malty nose, but it seems to come with a fluffy, aged and musty character which is not very attractive. I don't think that this is a very old bottle, but it tastes a bit old.
Refreshing with a dry, hoppy bitterish finish. Tastes reflect that old flavor too.
Decent, and apart from the odd, ""old"" taste."
Victory Brewing Company,Abbey Six,,,Belgian Pale Ale,6.00%,on-tap,2.98,2.5,3,3,2,3.5,7/31/2008,"Ran into this one on tap at The Brick Store, Decatur, GA, USA.
This has been getting some mixed reviews at the pub so I thought I'd better road test it myself to be sure.
Orange, hazed body with a moderate head and not a great deal of lace. Looks unspectacular and NOTHING like a ""Belgian Dark Ale"". I would be looking for a bigger head and some much darker, browns and blacks to get to that particular classic look. This looks more Tripel like.
Fruity ester meets the nose and the early palate. Nice if unspectaular. Residual sweetness comes through and the finish is dryish. Some Belgian yeast and candy character but not much. 
Pretty ordinary all the way around and the kicker is the mouthfeel. VERY thin for the (claimed) style, and really rather thin in general. One and done here, and although this is not a bad beer to actually sit down and drink a few of (the BS menu lists it as a ""sessionable Belgian""), the mouthfeel really lets it down and it is a VERY poor example of a Belgian Dark. Drink it not thinking of a Belgian Dark and you'll be happier."
Afanasy Pivo (Brau Service),Afanasy Svetloye,,,Euro Pale Lager,4.80%,bottle,2.23,2.5,3.5,2,2,1.5,7/27/2008,"Firstly, I cut and pasted the first part of this review from my review of the Dark, since a number of things are exactly the same.
Review #1600.
Well, interesting one this. 11.2 fl oz bottle that is a very attractive sight with its pyramid shape and some interesting raised lettering a the base of the bottle - I'm gonna keep this one, its decorative. ABC-3513 on the cap.
$1.19 from Michael's in Marietta, GA, USA as a single. I was pretty sure this was a very old bottle when I bought it, so I took a chance - why not? A closer inspection of the bottle at home shows that it has the (odd) numbers 1-31, I-XII and 02-04 on the label that COULD be notched but it ISN'T! This makes this at LEAST 3.75 years old and I would bet much older than even that. I also see that the last review was in 2005. I wouldn't mind betting that this beer is no longer imported and distributed in the US. Just a guess, but I would not be surprised.
Anyway, on to the beer itself. Pours with a cloudy orange color and no head or lace. A bit murky.
Nose is malty and musty.
Taste is basically as expected with a malt base and very little bitterness. The problem is that there is a VERY earthy note - a bit like soil! I suspect this is simply a function of age. Some oxidation, but not to the extent that I think it is nasty, but that may be because I like malty beers. Either way it's not great.
Glad I tried it, but I didn't finish the bottle since I was concerned about the age. Drain pour for 75% of the bottle."
Anadolu Efes Brewery,Efes Dark,,,Euro Dark Lager,6.50%,bottle,2.15,2,2.5,2,2.5,2,7/27/2008,"12oz clear bottle with raised lettering - attractive. $1.50 as a single from Green's on Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour is cola like - in fact almost EXACTLY like a Coke, including the lack of head, color and body!
Nose revela strong malts and a litte alcohol. 
Tastes have the malty character, but also a sweet, liquor-like taste. A bit like sherry. Finishes with a dry bitterness which is odd rather than tasty. The dry character lingers a while.
Not really very nice, and the 12oz bottle is a bit of a struggle to be honest. Not much to endear this to me at all."
Brasserie Dupont sprl,Avril,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,3.50%,bottle,4.15,4,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,7/27/2008,"Pretty new entrant to the GA market. Picked up a 750 mL at Greens on Buford, Atlanta, GA for $7.95 or $8.95 (can't remember), and then ran into it again a few hours later on tap at the Brick Store. This is a review of the bottle; corked & caged, 2.008 on the cork, L08081B 10:23 on the bottom right hand corner of the front label.
A professed, Biere de Table.
I bought this thinking that I was on very safe ground from the point of view that a Saison/Framhouse produced by Dupont was unlikely to produce any surpises, and would be good quality. Those assumptions are basically very sound.
Poured into the Duvel tulip we get a lightly clouded orange pour with a big initial head that fades to give some nice lace and a sotty, creamy head. Nose has the requisite white pepper and light fruit esters.
Tastes are exactly as expected with champagne like dry character with light, organic funk and tart acidity. Nothing to complex here, it ""just does what it says on the bottle"". Mouthfeel is pretty light, and at a REALLY REFRESHING (from all kinds of perspectives) 3.5% ABV this is a very nice beer that I could LITERALLY drink in 20oz pints!
DELIGHTED to find low a ABV, high quality beer for a change."
Brauerei Heller-Trum / Schlenkerla,Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock,,,Rauchbier,6.60%,bottle,4.1,4,4.5,4,4,4,7/27/2008,"Took a long time to get around to formally reviewing this - I don't know why.
500 mL bottle into the Harpoon IPA Willibecker glass.
Lots of dark brown/red highlights throughout the brew with a bone white half-inch head. Looks solid. Not much lace, by the head is nicely sustained.
All the usual attributes; strong smoke scent that reminds me of meat, nice body but the main thing I take away from this sampling is the strong sweetness that comes through as the beer warms. I've never noticed it that much before but here it was very prominent.
Simply a beer that has to be consumed with food, the meatier the better. I paired this with orange pork chops, grilled lemon asparagus and rice - delicious. Very satisfying beer."
Russian River Brewing Company,Damnation Batch 23 (Oak Aged),,,Tripel,11.00%,bottle,3.73,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,7/27/2008,"From notes: Thanks go out to Robet for a chance to try this at a recent Brick Store gathering.
A lighter than expected golden pour with a nose that reflects the oak. Robert said that chips were used rather than the barrel but to me it's difficult to detect such a nuance.
A light smokiness in the nose and taste which is probably a combination of the oak and my inability to pik it up correctly. Some of us at the tasting also got some estery pear notes. i got a touch of pineapple too. However, to me any fruit and Belgian charcter is swamped a bit by the oak and I lose the subtle edge of the brew.
Pretty drinkable, but doesn't mesh all that well for me."
Sharp's Brewery,Atlantic IPA,,,English India Pale Ale (IPA),4.80%,on-tap,4,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,7/27/2008,"Fantasic beer with a decent ABV (considering the style) that manages to combine both a refreshing, summer drinking type ability along with one of the more satisying experiences of a ""lighter"" beer.



A combination of four hop varities goes into the beer, which although not necessarily easy to detect as individual notes, do lend a certain complexity to the brew. A light citrus note is first followed by some deeper soapy like notes. The malt cuts across the whole beer to leave a satisfying mouthfeel. Quite ""meaty"".



I get a certain clean, sharpness about this beer that i wasn't expecting - it seems fresh, always a good sign.



I really enjoyed this, worth trying a couple of pints."
Sharp's Brewery,Eden Ale,,,English Pale Ale,4.40%,on-tap,3.68,4,3,3.5,4,4.5,7/27/2008,"Consumed at The Britannia Inn, St. Austell, Cornwall, England.
An interesting concept behind this beer - this is taken from the Saharp's web site;
""The Eden Project was set up in Cornwall to promote the understanding and responsible management of the vital relationship between plants, people and resources leading to a sustainable future for all.
At Sharp's we are committed to making great beer with the least possible impact on our environment. Eden Pure Ale was developed in conjunction with the Eden Project in order to prove that a natural beer brewed in conscience with the environment can taste so much better than the multitude of mass produced factory beers which these days crowd our public bars and supermarket shelves.""
Another classic English Pale with hop and malt subtlety blended to perfection. A biscuit, roastiness that reminds me of digestives gives the beer a detectable acidity in the mouth. There is a distinct fruit character (peach and pineapple) that combine with the lighter hop notes to give balance.
Very drinkable, if somewhat simple beer."
Southern Tier Brewing Company,Oat (Imperial Oatmeal Stout),,,American Double / Imperial Stout,9.60%,bottle,3.18,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,7/27/2008,"From notes:
Thanks go out to Robert for providing these samples at a recent Brick Store tasting. 220z bottle.
I've got to say right off the bat, that a beer at nearly 13% ABV kind of puts me off right from the beginning. Coupled with such a potentially enormous style, you are treading a very precarious line betweeen disaster and success. Sometime this can be pulled off, but it is a high risk, low reward strategy IMO.
Anyway on to the beer. Jet black pour as far as I could see, with a slight red/brown highlight at the very edge of the brew. Head fades to nothing fairly quickly to leave a spotty film with only a touch of lace. Looks just about as expected for the style and the ABV. Good legs.
Alcohol is upfront in the note, but there is a lack of chocolate or roasted notes until you get to the taste. This beer seems to me as though all of the elements of such a beer are there, but they are combined in a somewhat unbalanced and jumbled way. Even as far as to say that each mouthful seems different to the next. Now, sometimes you can call that complexity, but in this instance the roasty dark elements that compete with the oat/cereal backbone seems to create and uncomfortable marriage. The size of the ABV doesn't exactly help.
I dunno, this just fails to come together well for me. I get the impression that al lthe ingredients are there, but the sum of the parts falls short."
AleSmith Brewing Company,Alesmith Old Numbskull,,,American Barleywine,11.00%,bottle,2.4,2,3,2,3,2.5,7/26/2008,"Heavy, gorgeous looking 750 mL bottle with that ""thick"" silver foil on the neck and blue screen printed label details. $13.99 for Marty's in Boston. Looks impressive in terms of presentation.
Shared this one with Dave at The Brick Store.
Poured out as a unattractive, dirty brown turbid body with no lace and virtually no head either (as expected considering the ABV). Looks VERY ordinary, I would even go as far as to say disappointing. Another unattractive note is the fact that there seems to be degree of brown color, almost like pond water when sediment has fallen via gravity. However, I didn't see and sediment. Odd and not good looking at all.
Aroma is as expected with alcohol taking the lead ahead of the stron malt base.
An extremely edgy beer with a lack of subtlety and smoothness. I think this beer is caught between the American and English Style which makes it rather awkward. It has all the sweetness that you would expect from the English version, but none of the smoothness. American style big hop notes still prevail which meld poorly with the sugary malts, for frankly, a bit of a mess!
After the Wee Heavy, this is the second Alesmith beer that I have been sorely disappointed by after some really great experiences. I guess they have been relegated to a ""hit and miss"" brewery with me. Shame."
Flying Dog Brewery,Kerberos Tripel,,,Tripel,8.50%,bottle,3.45,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,7/26/2008,"12oz bottle for a $7.99 four pack from Tower on Piedmont. I've been putting off trying this for a while, not sure why.
Dark orange almost amber pour into the Duvel tulip. Head is scant and short lived, to leave a few bubbles and some spotty head on the surface of the beer. No lace on the glass.
Definitely a ""triple-like"" beer but ends up coming up a little short, and you can tell this is not an authentic, Belgian Tripel. Body lacks something, and although the nose and taste both have some peppery, ester like sweetness about them, in the end the whole seems less than the sum of the parts! A bit too raw in places. A hint of peach in the taste, but a ""stronger than I would like for the style"", raw alcoholic like burn.
OK, but not thrilling, nevertheless not bad value and a semi-drinkable beer. I've had worse, but then again I've had a hell of a lot better, especially within the style."
Fort Collins Brewing,Doppelbock,,,Doppelbock,10.20%,bottle,4.6,3.5,5,4.5,4,5,7/26/2008,"Thanks go out to russpowell for this.
WOW! I've had this one for a long time in the back of the DBF and I had very low expectations for it on a number of levels. Firstly I've had a couple of FC brews before and I was less than impressed. Secondly I've had this for quite a while and I thought that time would not have been all that kind to it. Thirdly, although I like the doppelbock style, there is a fine line between good and poor. So, I open this up not expecting much, and then...
...a nice chestnut pour with good clarity. Head is average and short lived and there is not much lace to speak of. 
Aroma is amazing. Partly because I DIDN'T realze this was a smoked beer! I thought it was just a regular Doppelbock. Mild smoke followed by a delicious smoked bacon note. Fantastically the bacon is deliciously replicated in the taste! I've had plenty of Rauchbiers before, and the ham note is often there, but this is really different - a REAL bacon character, and it's great!
Finishes smooth and pleasing with a little sweetness. I simply cannot believe this is 10.00% - the alcohol is absolutely NOWHERE to be seen, and it drinks like a beer less than half its ABV.
Tasty, and a HUGE surprise."

Complete clarity on the pour with a very light, high head that is short lived but leaves a small amount of decent lace. Golden color, light carbonation.
Very clean and smooth - definite cream soda note to the beer, especially in the finish.
Actually I really enjoyed this! Extremely surprising to me but the simplicity, non-skunked and clean edge to this beer was satisfying. I could go for a few of these in a baking hot ATL summer and after mowing the lawn. Cans add to the appeal. Nice."

Excited to try this, looks promising. Rustic looking label that brings back memories of my scores of happy summers drinking in Gites in France & Belgium. Best Before 09.28.09 with a batch #? of L11.2.13. French language on the label.
Label has 8% on it rather than the 7.2% in the BA db. I wondered about the best glass for this and was debating between the Duvel tulip and the Tucher Weizen. Eventually I went with the Weizen - not sure why!
Pours with a surprising golden clarity almost a macro lager like effect. HUGE, billowing, magnificently huge, sustained head that leaves amazing lace - looks super!
Smells and drinks more like a high alcohol euro lager - STRANGE! Slightly slick mouthfeel as well that comes with the mild burn. Sweet with a high alcohol feel about the whole thing.
A bit odd! It drinks a bit like a strong lager and almost nothing like a BdeG. It's not that I don't like it, it's just that it wasn't what I was expecting."

Bottle has dates for notching but no notches! This pisses me off a bit. If they are there why not use them??
Poured into the Duvel tulip after an initial promising pop, the body is a slightly murky, reddish chestnut brown. Head is large initially and looks deeper and richer than it actually turns out to be. Fades quickly with no lace on the glass to leave a fine, mocha foam on the surface.
Nose is a little musty with some fruit esters and some wood. 
Tastes are predominantly dry and I get some manure and a little cork-like bitterness. It tastes a little ""old"" - a bit floury, fluffly and lacking the usual funk edge that Fantome usually provides. I also get some red wine and tea like tanins.
This seems to lack a certain clean edge. Maybe its the age of the bottle, but I though that this would cope quite well. This is certainly not a REALLY old bottle so I am a little confused.
Not my favorite Fantome by a long way, and to be hnoest I was a little disappointed. It lacked sharpness and was a little dull. I don't *think* that the bottle was that old, but the beer seems a touch jaded."

The sample pour is a simple dark, dark brown with obviously no head or lace to speak of.
Aroma is very strong which I think I would really like if it not for the slight smoke and the overwhelming oak - I prefer a simpler, liquor like nose without the smokiness.
Very sweet and the sugary notes carry this. I quite like it, and the fact that the sweetness sort of overcomes the alcohol is a good thing for me. Having said this you are simply not going to be able to drink much of this one. I didn't really care for the Horn Dog original, and I am not a fan of BA beers in general, so I was surprised at the lack of offensive I took at this beer. nevertheless, strictly a one-off for me."

Well it is what it is - it's a pretty good example of an AMERICAN Brown Ale which basically means that it is way too hoppy and as a result loses all the charm of the original style which is all about smoothness and malt rather than bitterness. Nevertheless, a good example of that particular style.
Slightly murky mid-brown pour which is also not to my liking. I much prefer a darker brown and more clarity. However, the head and lace are good which somewhat makes up for the lack of pleasure in the appearance of the body.
Aroma ia more balanced than the taste with a good dose of malt and hoppy notes coming through.
The taste however, gets a little ""in your face"" (at least for a Brown Ale) and delivers (for me) too great a roasted note. On the roof of the mouth it really feels like I've been chewing some roasted dark grains - not what I want upfront in my Brown's. Finish has a residual hop bitterness that lingers - again, not huge, but still too much for me to really indulge and enjoy this beer to its fullest. there is a bit of a burned feel about the roastiness too, like unpleasant ash/smoke.
I dunno, I suppose it stacks up pretty well within the style, but its difficult for me to score this any higher since it just doesn't do it for me."

12oz single from Total Wine in Kennesaw, GA, USA.
Notched as being bottled in the first week in Feb. Reasonable to assume that this is Feb '08 (since Total Wine seems to have a decent turnover), but you never know!
Good, standard color for the style (pleasing) with copper and dark orange hues, and a good initial head, however, any lasting head and lacing are disappointing thus reducing the ultimate potential of the appearance score.
Sweet toffee based malts hit the nose and a similar candyish taste replicates itself in the taste. Smooth and easy drinking. Aftertaste is light and satifying.
All in all a decent stab at the ESB style with sensible ABV. Those attributes are unusual enough in many American versions of the style so I am turned on to this beer. Outside of that it is solid rather than spectacular, but I have to take what I can get whe I am so far from home. Above average for a Stateside version; average from a wider perspective."

Now under the simple moniker ""Czechvar""; presumably AB won the never ending court battle to use the word Budweiser - frankly I had lost touch.
Light yellow pour with a typical macro lager pour that lacks head, lace, presence or character. Tastes better than it looks with a slight corn nose and taste, but strangely seems quite clean at the same time.
Minor Saaz-like finish and a clean metallic aftertaste. Refreshing, and a better quality product than many similar attempts but still lacks a REALLY distinctive Saaz bite/edge for me. 
I dunno, I've been drinking this on and off for years (in England we used to get the chunky 500mL? bottles) but for me it's never really felt as clean as many Pilseners. Still a little disappointing to me and still hovers uncomfortably close to its namesake! I have the suspicion that amongst beer geeks this beer got a lot of sympathy over the AB battle, and perhaps as a result got a better press than it should have.
For me, average all the way."
Genesee Brewing Co.,Dundee Wheat Beer,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,4.20%,bottle,2.1,4,2,2,2,2,7/19/2008,"12 oz single from Beverage Resort, Kennesaw, GA, USA. $0.99. Purchased on a whim, this may be very old!
1787 R 09:07 4W dot matrixed on the neck of the bottle. A bit confused by this one, maybe this has already been retired, but it does not appear to be in the BA database. Adding for completeness.
Huge head on the pour with a murky orange body. Head and lace are both excellent. 
Unfortunately that's where the good stuff ends. Slight, carbonated clove in the nose but this is followed by a largely watery body. Thin and lacks presence. Lacks any kind of significant tastes, very disappointing. Not good.
Note: It WAS very old. It had the original, plastic type JW Dundee labels. Apparently the old ""Hefe"" is now marketed as the new ""Wheat"", either way it was really poor."
Weyerbacher Brewing Co.,Slam Dunkel,,,Weizenbock,7.00%,bottle,4.45,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,7/19/2008,"22oz bottle, $3.99 from Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA. Weyerbacher is new to GA in the last week or so and although I have had most of their offerings before, this and the XIII are new to me.
Poured into the Tucher 500mL Weizen glass this looks superb (or at least as superb as the ugly color can get!). The Tucher glass always shows off Weizens of any description so well. Head and lace are reserved, but look high quality and dense. There is a really creamy, mocha look to the head. Body has some of the typical murkiness about it, but there seems to be a darker note than in many others of the style. Carbonation and mouthfeel are perfect, and led to a really creamy, velvet like experience. Perfect.
Nose has a very sweet banana and a touch of clove and something else in the oregano/herbal nature.
Extremely rich, if standard tastes. I always feel that the Weizens can be let down by a watery feel to the taste or the mouthfeel but this beer comes through on both. As it warms on my deck in July Atlanta heat, the banana notes increase, but so does the sweetness.
The kind of beer that can restore ones faith in a style. Delicious and superb value."
Brouwerij De Ranke,Cuvée De Ranke,,,Belgian Pale Ale,7.00%,bottle,4.48,3,4.5,4.5,4,5,7/18/2008,"Picked this up as what appeared to be the very last bottle at Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA. I got lucky I guess, but being in Green's as often as I am sometimes makes me lucky! Anyway, paper wrapped, 750 mL bottle, capped and corked. Brickstoredave told me a very limited amount made it to GA so I feel privileged.
Disappointing lack of ""pop"" on opening. I wasn't expecting a HUGE bang, but given that this is categorized as a BPA rather than a Lambic I though that there would be a little more carbonation. Poured in to the Duvel tulip the body is a dark orange, murky concoction with a very scant head and no lace. Much more Lambic in the look than BPA - make of that what you will.
Nose has the requisite cider (West Country, England) funk. This gets better as the temperature increases. Finally gets to a delicious, mildly acidic, dry scrumpy feel. This is as close to an EXACT replica of a genuine Devonshire or Somerset farmhouse cider that I can remember in a beer. It's also reminiscent of the dry Calvados based drinks of Northern France.
Drinkability is astonishing for me. 750 mL gone in NO time, and the ABV is not SO punishing that it hurts.
WOW - a beer that genuinely excites me; these are few and far between these days."
De Proefbrouwerij (bvba Andelot),Reinaert Flemish Wild Ale,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,9.00%,bottle,3.95,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,7/17/2008,"$7.99 for Mac's Midtown, Atlanta, GA, USA. Corked & Caged 750 mL.
Pour is a bright orange in the Terrpain 22oz snifter. Large initial head with some nice retention across the body and a little lace. Carbonation is high.
Not sure if this should be categorized as a simple Belgian Pale, but I am not as preturbed as I sometimes am with style considerations and the BA database, since this has ""Flemish"", ""Brettanomyces"", ""Saccharomyces"" and ""Wild Ale"" on the label. That means that I am NOT surprised when the beer turns out to have plenty of funk, a sour edge and lots of rustic, cider character! Lots of warning!
I'm learning a lot with these brews, and the largest single factor seems to be that the second glass with a little higher temperature and in the wake of the first glass, is always better, smoother and more to my liking.
Nose has a citrus, band aid phenol edge. Tastes are more dry cider like, and the body is very pleasing and warm. Clean finish with a touch of lemon.
Quite acidic in the end, with a bittering effect that is not especially forgiving. This strikes me as a funk beer for the more experienced raher than a newcomer. Nice."

12 oz bottle, directly from Scotland sent by James from the brewery.

AleSmith Brewing Company,AleSmith Wee Heavy,,,Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy,10.00%,bottle,3.3,2.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,7/13/2008,"750 mL, heavy glass bottle capped and finished with that thick, high gauge silver foil. $13.99 from Marty's on my March 2008 trip to Boston.
Poured into the Terrapin 22oz snifter. Head was disappointing, but based on the ABV not all that surprising. No lace. Quite frankly the color and look of the beer is very disappointing too. A nasty, turbid brown body which on closer inspection looks really watery. 
Nose is all sweet malts with quite a whiff of alcohol. The alcohol, although strong is also pretty smooth.
Tastes replicate the nose pretty much (which is a good thing). Slightly more edgy with the alcohol in the taste, and it finishes with a noticeable bitterness. A touch of smoke, but it's barely there. In the aftertaste there is a definite liquor note as well - a slight Scotch element. In its favor, as it warms it gets better. Not a very subtle interpretation.
To be honest all in all I was rather let down by this. One of my favorite American brewers and one of my favorite styles, but the whole thing seemed out of whack to me. It seemed out of style and just too pumped up and not smooth enough, not subtle enough, not rounded enough and not malty enough. I dunno...."
Hoppin' Frog Brewery,B.O.R.I.S. The Crusher Oatmeal-Imperial Stout,,,Russian Imperial Stout,9.40%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,7/13/2008,"Big thanks go out to Tim (5thOhio) for the chance to have a crack at this (at the time) top 100 beer.
22 oz bomber poured into the Brasserie de l'Abbaye des Rocs chalice. Jet black body with no hint of any light penetrating the beer. Fine mocha head on top, no lace.
Standard nose for the style. Fairly light mouthfeel, not at all heavy or cloying which can happen with the style. Light roastiness like a bitterness that a coffee can give without the coffee taste.
Light bitterness in the initial tastes and it leads with an Oatmeal character too. Bitterness lingers and there is a touch in the aftertaste, but paradoxically I would not describe this beer as ""bitter"". Obviously the hops are cutting in. Alcohol is well hidden.
Simple but nice RIS. Not ""amazing"" to me, but nevertheless very enjoyable."
Kona Brewing Company,Wailua Wheat,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,5.40%,bottle,2.9,3,2.5,3,3,3,7/12/2008,"12oz single from Total Wine, Kennesaw, GA, USA.
Pale hazy yellow pour with very little head or lace. The look is fairly unispirational. 
A fairly large whiff of fruit in the nose, but not anything that I could distinguish as passion fruit - just generally ""fruity"".
Light bitterness with a fruity edge summarizes the taste. A light wheat angle, but it is cleaner than most and slightly acidic. A bit like a fruit juice. Tasty.
VERY hot days and pools/beaches is about the extent of this beers interest for me. Not bad, but just lacks much character. Quite bland."
Magic Hat Brewing Company,Circus Boy,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,4.40%,bottle,3.33,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,7/12/2008,"12oz bottle as part of a 12 pack sampler from Harris Teeter, Hilton Head Island (Main St. location), SC, USA.
I've had this a few times before, time to review it now. Nice golden body with surprisingly clarity.
The bottle is emblazoned with the label ""The Hefeweizen"". Has some simple coriander type notes in the nose and taste along with a little acidity and fruit. In fact the beer really is quite fruity indeed.
Slight over-prickly carbonation which I don't really care for. Finishes clean, almost bland.
Not bad, and I am not sure what this really is. Good summer sipper and pretty good value in the mixed sampler."
Shmaltz Brewing Company (He'Brew),Coney Island Albino Python,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,6.00%,bottle,4.33,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,7/12/2008,"22oz bottle into the DFH palm glass. Purchased from Reilley's on Hilton Head Island, SC, USA.
Big head on the pour with some decent lace. Seems a little over-carbonated. Cloudy lemon color.
Nose has quite a strong lemon, menthol, spice note. 
Lemon grass taste. Very refreshing, quite complex with spice notes. Orange character, some medicinal phenols and esters too. A touch of pepper. A really interesting brew. Extremely drinkable. 
If you like spiced beer, you'll probably love this one."
Lagunitas Brewing Company,We're Only In It For The Money,,,Tripel,8.20%,bottle,3.75,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,7/10/2008,"Purchased from Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA. 22oz bomber. 4th in the Zappa series from Lagunitas.
Poured into the Ommegang chalice the beer has a classic dark orange/golden Tripel hue, and initially a good head. This fades quickly though and leaves not much lace at all. Not ALL that surprising given the ABV.
A little white pepper and lemon grass in the nose. A little spice here and in the taste.
Mouthfeel is a little slick at first, but gets creamier as you drink more. Good fruity notes, but it cuts in quite bitter (grapefruit note) and relatively dry in the finish. I think that I would prefer a little more sweetness but that is more of a personal choice thing. Alcohol is there, but in check.
Nice example of a ""less sweet"" Tripel, so should find favor with many."
Twain's Billiards and Tap,Twain's Temperent Temperance Mild Ale,,,English Dark Mild Ale,?,on-tap,3.53,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,7/10/2008,"Nice clarity on the 12oz pour with a small head that maintains a ring of lace on the surface and a little on the glass. Good chestnut color.
Some real metallic bitterness here, especially in the finish which has a little copper coinage metal in the back.
Nice beer, that is a bit edgy, and for me lacks a little sophistication. Also, to me this is simply NOT a mild ale. In my milds (which I think are originals) we would look for more sweetness, a greater malt presence and less bittering from the hops. 
Having said ALL of that, this is still a decent beer that is drinkable and I enjoyed, but it's certainly not a classic, English Mild."
New Holland Brewing Company,New Holland Red Tulip Ale,,,American Amber / Red Ale,?,bottle,4.08,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,7/6/2008,"Purchased as a single at Sam's Blue Light in Durham, NC on a recent jaunt up the East Coast.
12oz bottle, poured into the Duvel tulip.
Initial nice head that fades to give a little head on the surface, but not much lace. Standard, solid copper color in the body with little else to report. Carbonation seems appropriate.
Nose and tastes have some really solid malts. Not much hop presesnce, so this sits at the ""English"" end of the ""Red/Amber/Bitter"" spectrum. Very easy drinking and some biscuit character. A tiny liquor presence in the nose too.
Smooth mouthfeel with a dry (but NOT typically harsh) finish. Nice brew."
Brewer's Brewing Co.,Albergottie Amber,,,American Amber / Red Ale,?,on-tap,4.33,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,7/5/2008,"Josh described this to me as a lighter version of an amber that drinks much more like a lager - he was spot on, with the drinkability being a BIG plus. Very easy, light drinking and much less ""red"" than you would imagine for the style.



In his words, ""Dark copper in color with a subtle roasted flavor. This beer is a low hopped, very drinkable beer with a wonderful flavor profile"".



Simple copper colored body with a nice head and lace. Good clarity, nice looking and in line with the style. Very light and easy drinking with the balance being the key. Strong malts are present to balance the subtle hops, and the beer goes down REAL easy. A little nutty, and some light burned (roasted malt) notes too, albeit in the far, far back.



VERY tasty and drinkable brew, that definitely has the lager feel about it. The favorite of mine of the brews that I tried on my visit."
Brewer's Brewing Co.,Parris Island Oatmeal Porter,,,American Porter,?,on-tap,3.85,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,7/5/2008,"An unusual combo this one, oatmeal used in a Porter rather than a Stout. Struck me as a pretty light body for the style, with good color, head and lace. The light body adds to the drinkability, but could do with a little ""beefing up"".



Josh desribes this, thus; ""Crafted from chocolate and crystal malts, this medium bodied porter has a sweet distinct chocolate taste, followed by a smooth mellow finish.



Plenty of smooth, creamy notes to this, and the chocolate malts shine through. Mild roastiness and drinks easily. Finish is creamy, but with a hint of bitterness in the aftertaste. Nice, if somewhat slight unusual Porter."
Brewer's Brewing Co.,Paddlers Organic Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),5.60%,growler,4.38,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,7/5/2008,"Took home a growler of this after trying a few at the brewpub.



Pale Orange body with a slight chill haze type appearance. Head is high and gives amazingly good lace. VERY good looking.



Nose and tastes are of that of an IPA rather than a Pale Ale. Very pronounced, typical vigorous hops in the nose and the taste. Bitter bite in the finish. Grassy and rustic to the core. Another beer from this brewpub athat feels really light in the mouth. VERY easy drinking, almost ""summer quencher"" like.



Josh describes the beer thus; ""Copper in color, medium in body with a pronounced hoppy taste and a mild bitterness in the finish"". I'd only disagree on the color which is much lighter than ""copper""."
Brewer's Brewing Co.,Port Royal Light,,,Light Lager,?,on-tap,3.48,4,3,3.5,3,4,7/4/2008,"Described by Josh as, ""Our lightest beer yet - straw in color, with a crisp, clean finish and a light hop character. Perfect for those steamy Beaufort days & nights"".



Difficult to argue with the description of the beer as being light, this brew is a very nice example of the style, but simply something I am not especially interested in. It DOES have the redeeming characteristics of a beer in the style, namely really good head and great lace, great clarity and a simple, refreshing clean edge that lacks skunk. That combination made it popular with my wife who can only drink beers like this one.



My guess is that this beer forms part of the line-up strictly for commercial purposes, and for that who can blame them. Actually a good example of the style, but of course not really a beer that will inspire most BA's - a necessary evil for the enterprise!"
Brewer's Brewing Co.,Brickyard IPA,,,American IPA,7.10%,on-tap,4.2,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,7/4/2008,"Not sure if this one should be entered as a DIPA, but for now it's just a LARGE IPA! Josh says, ""Light Copper in color, with a huge hop aroma followed by a strong hop bitterness. This one is for all you hop heads out there!""



I would describe the color as much more yellow than copper. A real butterscotch hue in the glass, with almost a ""cask like"" head. For those of you unfamiliar, that means really just some soapy bubbles on top of the beer rather than a tightly formed, compact and dense ""white"" head. Bubbles leave some pleasing lace.



No doubt that we have a bitter, solid IPA here. Drinks well below the advertised 7.1% and acts as a real thirst quencher that satisfies right off the bat. Grassy notes upfront that settle to a more rounded bitter palate in the back. Slight metal sits pleasingly in the finish and aftertaste.



A VERY interesting beer. Aroma is backed up by a ballsy hop presence that remains in check with the malt backbone. I got some alcohol, but it did not seem anywhere near 7.1%. Very impressed with the drinkability - one look and it was gone!"
De Leyerth Brouwerijen (Urthel),Urthel Vlaemse Bock,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,7.50%,bottle,3.7,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,7/4/2008,"750 mL corked & caged, Arbor Place Beverage, Douglasville, GA, USA.
Slightly cloudy, reddish Dubbel-like pour that starts with a good head but fades rather badly giving no lace. 
Nose has plenty of Bock notes with rich alcohol and some depth - promising. Tastes are interesting becasue I was expecting a degree of acidity associated withe the brew but got NONE. Essentially this was a simple, Dopplebock/Dubbel crossover brew with Belgian yeast notes and GEerman alcohol and malt character.
Good, solid brew, but for me I suspect this is one and done. There are better Belgian darks, better Bocks/Doppelbocks, better Dubbels and better Flemish brews out there. Not bad, but it straddles too many styles for me."
Yuengling Brewery ,Yuengling Light Lager,,,Light Lager,3.40%,bottle,2.43,3,2,2.5,2.5,2.5,7/4/2008,"12oz bottle, $3.00 Wild Wing Cafe, Hilton Head Island, SC, USA.
Well, what exactly are you expecting?? An amberish pour with good clarity and a decent head. Of course, in true macro style the head is gone in seconds to leave no lace and a simple, light brown body.
Mouthfeel is largely non-existent, and the beer lacks all character and has virtually no aroma. Some grain notes, and cleanish so that's OK. The color is better than usual, but otherwise it would be difficult to distinguish this from hundreds of oter macros.
Ho hum, there it is. Not the worst macro in the world, but still in the same category. I like the ABV."
Brasserie Fantôme,Fantôme Saison D'Erezée - Printemps,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,8.00%,bottle,4.33,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,7/2/2008,"$9.99 for the 750 mL capped and corked bottle from Cheers, Carrollton, GA, USA.
Massive cascading streams of bubbles on opening that continues into the glass. Head slowly recedes to not much, and the lacing is scant. A dark orabge, chill hazed body that looks like a classic IPA.
Nice sweet, horseblanket funk in the nose, with plenty of grass notes. 
Light mouthfeel is cut across by a definite acidity and a lingering, sweet and sour finish. A cleanliness about the beer which is contrasted by a sharp, grapefruit bitter ending. Coupled with the appearance and the color, the finish could almost get away as being a ""sort of"" IPA!
It's the real deal in terms of the style, with a darker edge. Not as simple as some Saisons, this is a beer with more complex and complicated complexity!! A Saison for the mature drinker."
Shmaltz Brewing Company (He'Brew),Coney Island Sword Swallower,,,American Pale Lager,6.80%,bottle,3.23,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,6/30/2008,"22oz bottle, from Reilley's HHI.
Golden honey colred pour with a small head and a small amount of lace.
Sweet nose with a mild skunkiness to it as well. 
Sweet malts up front with a slight cloying feel. A rather astringent bitter finish that is quite metallic. Almost Saaz like in the ending. The bitterness lingers significantly.
Reminded me of a Czech Pils but with more sweetness and a little less class!"
Hilton Head Brewing Company,Mocha Porter,,,American Porter,?,on-tap,3.05,3,3,3,2.5,3.5,6/29/2008,"Drunk on my June 2008 visit to HHI.



Standard color in the pour but little or no head and zero lace. Looks a bit flat, which is strange because the beer has an odd, prickly over carbonation that is inappropriate for the style.



Interesting tasting beer though. Quite light and lively with a decent malt base and some chocolate notes. Quite a distinct coffee finish. Not the worst beer that I have drunk at HHB, so in that respect it was not too bad, but still an ""amatuerish"" feel about the beer - drinks like something I fell that I could quite easily produce in my basement without too much effort.



I dunno, just another very, very average effort from these guys - at least it wasn't as bad as some of the others that I have tried here."
Mikkeller,Santa's Little Helper 2007,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,11.00%,bottle,4.88,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,6/29/2008,"$14.95 from Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA. 750 mL corked & caged affair with a red foiled neck. Poured into a small wine glass whilst on vacation in a villa on Hilton Head Island.
Deep, dark Porter colored body. Close to jet black with some brown highlights.
Nose and tastes are both VERY complex. There are all the requisite dark Belgian chracteristics. Plenty of dark fruits, figs and raisins; warming alcohol. The finish pulls the whole package together with a lovely mildly acidic note that completes the package nicely. A very light licorice note as well. Alcohol warms lightly in the throat. Smooth and luxurious in the mouth - velvet like.
The spice character is pretty muted with the possibility of some corriander and a little nutmeg, but not much else. Belgian style yeasts and candy come through too.
I put off buying this for a few months, and then put off drinking it for a little while as well - I shouldn't have done either! Delicious."
Rinkuškiu Alaus Darykla,Lobster Lovers Beer,,,Euro Strong Lager,9.50%,bottle,2.18,2.5,2,2,2.5,2.5,6/27/2008,"Turned up as a single, 500 mL bottle at Smyrna World of Beverage for $2.09. A separate label hangs on the neck, which in impossibly big characters, advertises the beer as a 9.5% brew! Obviously a BIG selling point for the beer.
Pours an deep orange gold body with a high light head that lasts for about 30 seconds. Looks slightly viscous in the glass. Slight alcohol in the nose.
Taste has that typical, high alcohol, syrupy slightly malted citrus note. The beer is not the worst of its type that I have ever drunk, but it is still in that nasty, poor quality Eastern European feel. The best way I can describe this, is that it is the kind of beer that I could imagine would give you a NASTY hangover.
There it is - sweet and nasty. One and out."
Terrapin Beer Company,Terrapin RoggenRauchBier,,,Rauchbier,5.70%,bottle,2.95,3,3,3,2.5,3,6/27/2008,"22oz bomber, $5.99 from Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Good clarity on the pour with a chestnut colored hue, an initial large, off-white head then a thin film and very little lace.
Nose has a hint of smoke but it is not substantial. Similarly in the taste there is a little smoke, not much rye and a rather lackluster feel to the whole thing. Slight bitterness in the finish, but it's not much at all. 
Has the feel of a rather weak, poor Brown Ale with a light body. I opened this purposely with food thinking that the smoke would hold up well, but it was drowned out by some simple fare. This ended up be neither a rye beer or a Rauchbier and the whole experience left me feeling rather flat and unimpressed.
I dunno, that makes Terrapin 0 for 2 on the side project beers IMO and it makes me wonder if they are just trying to capitalize on a trend rather than really produce some exceptional, one off stuff - what's next?"
Butte Creek Brewing Company,Spring Run Organic Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),5.70%,bottle,3.85,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,6/26/2008,"22oz bomber.
Nice pale orange pour with good clarity and appropriate carbonation. Head is high and light, and fades to give a thin layer of lace on the surface of the beer and a little lace on the glass.
Nose has a very light touch with the hops - a fresh, grassy note that is repeated down the road in the taste. Not much aftertaste apart from a touch of unsweetened, metallic grapefruit.
A touch thin in the mouth, but the upside of that is that the beer drinks very light and refreshing.
All in all a very simple American Pale Ale with that typical American ""extra hope profile"". Organic to boot so it's worth a look."
Brasserie Dieu Du Ciel,Route Des Épices (Ale Rousse Au Poivre),,,Rye Beer,5.00%,bottle,3.53,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,6/22/2008,"A dark brown, reddish hue to the brew in the Brasserie de l'Abbaye des Rocs Chalice. Small head that fades to give a spotty film. A small amount of lace.
It's difficult for me to remember a beer where the tastes match the ingredients so well. Rye upfront very obviously AND the finish, well it's 100% peppercorns - dramatic!! The pepper is STRONG too - really strong! Look out if this is not your thing.
That sums it up - there's LITERALLY nothing else required to describe the beer! Perhaps some caramel malt in the finish. This is going to be best paired with food and there are LOTS of options."
Brooklyn Brewery,Brooklyner-Schneider Hopfen-Weisse,,,Weizenbock,8.50%,bottle,3.73,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,6/22/2008,"$11.99 from Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA.
GREAT looking 750mL corked & caged bottle, a super looking presentation.
It pours a light, honey colored body and a big head in the Tucher 500 mL glass. A lot lighter than the other version. After an initial big frothy head it fades to give a much less dense, wispy type of head. Some very fine lace.
Smell has pretty much a sweet, light alcohol and not a great deal else.
Tastes are a simple, sweet grapefruit juice. Not much else in terms of complexity or characer to me. Perhaps the mere hint of pineapple. There is a slight dry, hoppy finish but it's hardly prevelant. This beer is MUCH more drinkable than the other version. It seems lighter, less cloying and just more drinkable and approachable."

I saw this maybe two summers ago on Hilton Head Island on draft at Mellow Mushroom. At the time I avoided it thinking that it was just another nasty, macro product. A little investigation proved this to be the case, and I have avoided trying it until now. This 12oz bottle came from Total Wine, Kennesaw, GA, USA as a single.
""Born On"" (WHAT BULLSHIT) May 2nd 2008, this is a positively ANCIENT A-B product! Over carbonated and a lager like body that has an odd metallic nose. VERY clean, almost surgical. A little phenolic note in the nose, that doesn't quite get to the antiseptic BandAid level, but is noticeable. Large head that fades in an instant.
Maximum burps and bloating with a honey like taste. Smooth in the mouth at the same time as being almost with out body.
Lighter than light; watery beyond watery, what can I tell you????"
Brouwerij Riva S.A.,Lucifer,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,8.50%,bottle,3.45,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,6/21/2008,"New, updated 330 mL stubbie bottle. Purchased as a single from Total Wine, Kennesaw, GA, USA.
Alarming pale color on the pour and an equally alarming, large head that is VERY, VERY wispy and lacks any kind of density. Honey colored body eventually settles out as the bottle conditioning yeast hits the color. Some lace after the head subsides BUT it is VERY light.
Nose has a little of everything that you would expect, PLUS some white pepper. Plenty of candy sugar and yeast along with the alcohol.
Dry and clean in the taste. Alcohol dryness dominates the Belgian notes, but that's OK. Short finish with a dash of malt, this beer is pretty lightweight all around.
I like it as an example of the style, but the truth of the matter is that is lacks much depth or mouthfeel. Better beers out there in this category."
Brouwerij Slaapmutske,Slaapmutske Triple Nightcap,,,Tripel,8.10%,bottle,4.45,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,6/21/2008,"750 mL corked & caged bottle with that nasty synthetic cork. $8.99 from Arbor Place Beverage, Douglasville, GA, USA.
Opens with a healthy 'pop' and poured into the Duvel tulip. Mid orange body sits underneath a towering head with wonderful lace. Darker than many Tripels but with the lacing this looks VERY good. Lacing is some of the best I have seen in some time.
Nose has a big, musty Belgian candy note. VERY malty in the aroma too with lots of Brown sugar.
The beer drinks much less sweet than the nose would suggest. Some yeasty fruits up front and a slight bitterness in the background. It finishes with a hoppy, almost tobacco note. Lacks the typical sweetness associated with many Tripels. Alcohol is nowhere to be seen, but there are plenty of burned malts in there too. 
Interesting beer in as much as it is not as sweet or as alcoholic as many Tripels and has a distinct bitterness (citrus rind or mixed peel; maybe even a little grapefruit). I'm not sure how old this bottle is (I suspect that it has some age on it) but it has been kind and the beer drinks very well."

Small 250mL serving in the De Glazen glass - why expect anything else? This is The Brick Store for crying out loud!
A richly orange marmalade colored body that looks viscous and rich. This is much darker and more orange than the standard Tripel. The head is not huge, but it does leave some superb lace.
Tripel like nose but with less fruit and more emphasis on the alcohol. However, this is not as aggressive in the taste as either the look or the nose would suggest. This is an unusual Tripel in terms of it's richness - I like it a lot.
Drinks quite boozy, but in a controlled manner. Very tasty and a rich brew. More than a couple of small glasses and it would be too much for me."
Oskar Blues Grill & Brewery,Chubourbon,,,Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy,?,on-tap,4.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,6/21/2008,"On tap at The Brick Store, Decatur, GA, USA.
Small (perhaps 10oz) pour with a jet black body and a quite large (for the serving), dense mocha head.
It's worth while saying at the outset that I am not especially keen on the Bourbon aged brews. I often find that the Bourbon simply takes over the brew, and in the case of, say, a RIS there is no need to add an extra dimension to an already huge combo of characteristics.
Anyway, this is MUCH more subtle than many other Bourbon aged beers that i ahve had in the past. The nose has some vanilla notes, and it drinks a little sweeter rather than roasty and dark. I think the style is a better vehicle for the Bourbon; here it seems to mesh nicely with the richness of the malts AND (for me) it has the added advantage of taking the smoke elements OUT. 
I think this is very drinkable, ESPECIALLY for the style (I gave the score for drinkability in the context of the style). Tasty and not overpowering, BUT having said that 10oz is just about enough for me."
Allagash Brewing Company,Allagash Rosa,,,American Wild Ale,8.00%,on-tap,3.7,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,6/20/2008,"Enjoyed this one as part of the 11th Anniversary celebrations with Lance, Dave, Mike et al at The Brick Store, Decatur, GA, USA yesterday.
Significantly orange body with a limited amount of head and lace. It actually appeared that the glassware was seriously affecting the head and lace; the Allagash stemmed glass produced some nice attributes while other glasses did not do the appearance justice. Clouded body beneath the varying amounts of head.
Plenty of Brett in the nose, but it never really cuts in until the finish where it was really quite acidic. Pretty much what you would expect from the style but lacked a touch of body and presence for me. Light yeast character also. The variation in appearance summed up the whole beer for me - just a bit hit & miss, as if it were not ""quite"" there.
Most people drinking this thought that it was fantastic. I really enjoyed it, but I still felt it was a little on the edgy side of things. Maybe it needed a tad more time, or perhaps the journey had not been kind to the brew, but either way it felt like it was a really good beer that was performing just below its best. Almost a great beer."
Coopers Brewery Limited,Premium Lager,,,Euro Pale Lager,5.00%,bottle,3.83,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,6/18/2008,"As a single from Total Wine, Kennesaw, GA, USA. 
Standard look with all the things I am looking for from the style; a golden pour with exceptional clarity. A pretty good head, some lace and no skunk. It hits on all of these points, and in addition is refreshing and tasty.
Malts a re solid and a small hop balance finishes the whole thing off.
A simple and nice brew, wel within the parameters of the style and it hits all the spots."
Brasserie Dieu Du Ciel,Dernière Volonté,,,Belgian Pale Ale,7.00%,bottle,3.8,4,4,4,3,3.5,6/16/2008,"Green's, Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Poured into the Val Du Dieu chalice the beer is rather well carbonated but fizzy rather than controlled. A lovely, golden yellow body sits underneath the scant head and some lace accrues.
Interesting nose and taste. This drinks like a non-sweet Tripel with plenty of alcohol character and lots of spicy white pepper. What seems missing from the mix is a residual sweetness and a smoothness that I would expect from a Belgian Pale. Very large, grapefruit citrus taste too.
Lacks a bit in the body, and if I am going to drink a Belgian Pale I want a little more sweetness and a little more depth. I like the pepper character but against the backdrop of a relatively thin body it loses its charm rather quickly.
OK, but not really for me."
Abita Brewing Co.,Wheat,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,4.20%,bottle,2.68,3,2.5,2.5,3,3,6/15/2008,"12oz single from Mac's Midtown, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Poured into the Tucher Weizen, 500 mL glass. 
Frankly this is a bit odd. It pours more like a macro lager, and lacks a cloudy appearance. It must be filtered?
Nose is a sweetish, corny skunk and this is followed by the taste. It's not really offensive, but if this was a blind tasting I would never have put this down as a wheat. Essentially this looks, tastes and drinks much like a macro lager. Disappointing in two respects; firstly simply from the point of view of the beer not being very good, but secondly in terms of the advertised style.
Finishes with a SLIGHT dry bitterness but that evaporates almost immediately.
Another, average (or below) Abita offering."

12oz single from Total Wine, Kennesaw, GA, USA. 07/08/2008 as the Best Before Date on the neck of the clear bottle.
Pour is as expected; a dark orange, urine colored liquid with a large fizzy head that lasts for about 5 seconds. No lace.
Nose reveals VERY little other than a touch of skunk. Not offensive, rather simply bland and nothing there.
Highish carbonation greets the tongue on the first taste. After that it's followed by dry, mildly bitter macro corn tastes. Watery in the aftertaste and mouthfeel.
I dunno - baking hot weather on the beach - maybe one or two; outside of that never again!"
Orange Blossom Pilsner LLC,Orange Blossom Pilsner,,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,6.50%,bottle,1.9,3,2,2,1.5,1.5,6/15/2008,"12oz single from Total Wine, Kennesaw, GA, USA.
I didn't know that this was made by Thomas Creek before I bought it, and to be honest, had I known I would have probably passed. Almost everything from them has been a HUGE mess. Ho Hum, let's try again.
Gold clarity on the pour, with a head that is certainly NOT large, but does leave a small film on the surface. No lace. Not bad looking, just the standard macro look.
A touch of citrus in the nose, but not much.
Mouthfeel is woefully poor; watery even.
Well, if this is a Pils, I'm a Dutchman. This is essentially a macro lager with hardly any flavor other than a watery bitterness. If there is honey in there it's largely absent in the taste. A annoying prickly carbonation finishes the package.
Thomas Creek is basically a pretty poor brewery IMO."
Mendocino Brewing Company,Special Edition - Bock Beer,,,Bock,7.00%,bottle,3.98,3.5,4,4,4,4,6/14/2008,"12oz single from Total Wine, Kennesaw, GA, USA.
Amber pour with a tasty looking head and some chill haze. Not much lace. Head fades quickly though.
Nose has a lot of sweet malts which is an excellent sign for the style.
Really tasty and malty upfront tastes as one would expect. There is a little residual bitterness in the finish which is an interesting departure. 
Alcohol provides a small kick too.
All in all a very nice beer which is very much in style and in that respect it pleases me."
Mikkeller,All Others Pale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),6.00%,bottle,3.3,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,6/14/2008,"500 mL bottle from Green's on Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA. $7.95 (or maybe $8.95) for the bottle.
Pour is a lively one with plenty of bone-white head on top of the mid-orange body. A little sticky lace.
A healthy dose of citrus/West coast pine in the nose and I think, ""look out, this is going to be just too big!"" Luckily the big nose is a little more tempered in the taste, and it seems to drink more like a diluted West Coast hopbomb. As the label suggests, there is a certain ""green"" feel to the hops.
This one skirts the edge of easy drinkability though, because the although the hops ARE controlled, they are still astringent and without a great deeal of malt support. 
I think this is on the brink of being a DIPA in terms of the hop profile, although it drinks a little easier."
Victory Brewing Company,Uncle Teddy's Bitter,,,English Bitter,4.00%,on-tap,3.58,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,6/14/2008,"On tap at The Brick Store, Decatur, GA, USA.
Pint poured with a surprising degree of chill haze and a distinct lack of clarity which worried me. The head was not well formed either, and the lace suffered a little - I was also surprised at the temperature - The Brick Store is usually pretty much spot on with temp, but this seemed too cold. Mid-brown body. Not the best beer i have ever seen in the glass.
Nice malt based bitter with a simple light hop profile lurking underneath and in the finish. A few summer, soft fruits in there too to pull the beer together. A little more tannin/tea character (which has a drying effect) for my taste, but a decent stab at the style.
Delighted by the ABV and the sessionable possibilities, I just wish that we saw more of these in the USA."
Butte Creek Brewing Company,Butte Creek Organic Revolution XI Imperial IPA,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,8.60%,on-tap,3.83,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,6/13/2008,"On tap, $5.75 for the 16oz our, Taco Mac, midtown, Atlanta, GA, USA. Served too cold.
Cloudy, deep orange pour with a small head (partially because of the pour which was not aggressive), but still yields some good lace. The lack of clarity is not that attractive.
The nose on the beer is as expected with a full blown blast of hops but it seems controlled. Similarly, in the taste we have a big hop presence but the whole thing is tempered with malt and the beer is memorable as sweet rather than a hop bomb - surprising. Malts dominate for me! Basically this seems like a MALTY DIPA!!??
From memory (and looking at my notes) this is MUCH less aggressive in terms of sweetness (and therefore a better beer) than the X. Glad that I gave it another chance."
Kulmbacher  Brauerei AG,Kulmbacher Edelherb Premium Pils,,,German Pilsener,4.90%,on-tap,2.1,2,2,2,3,2,6/13/2008,"On tap at Taco Mac midtown, Atlanta, GA, USA. $6.00 for the 16oz pour.
Macro, pale yellow pour with plenty of clarity and carbonation but a lack of head and lace. Disappointing look to the beer.
To be honest a dreadful disappointment. Lacks Saaz bite, cleanliness, and general refreshing qualities. I am beginning to wonder if TM has put a macro beer on tap instead of the advertised! Plenty of vegetable notes and corn finish. Not good at all.
Bad value and a pretty poor beer - lacked Pils character in all respects for me."

Cloudy, lemon colored pour that has some chill haze - looks a little Hefe-like. Sweet, mild honey like tastes with little or no distinguishable, nose. Some pepper creeps into the finish. A really odd beer this one that seems to me to be a collection of many different styles rolled into one. Some macro lager, light lager, Wit and even a little Saison.
Strange, but drinkable and tasty but HORRIBLE (even in a bar) value!"
Kona Brewing Company,Longboard Island Lager,,,American Pale Lager,4.60%,bottle,3.48,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,6/12/2008,"Relatively new to GA (within the last few weeks), I've now managed to try this, my second of the Kona brewing beers. I actually quite enjoyed the Fire Rock Pale so I thouhgt I would give this one a spin.
12oz bottle purchased as a single from Total Wine, Kennesaw, GA, USA.
Golden macro-like pour with a bubbly head. Head is gone quickly to revel virtually no lace. 
Sweet but clean nose.
Drinks really quite hoppy (at least within the parameters of the style). A saaz type bite in the finish, but it is a little less clean than that you would expect from a Pils. Slight aftertaste that is a little metallic.
Creamy for the mouthfeel (again, in the context of the style).
Actually not bad at all. Couled with the Fire Rock Pale I've been happy with the first two offerings from Kona - will they go on to bigger and better things? I guess time will tell."

Picked this up at Arbor Place in Douglasville, GA, USA. Date on the bottle is 03/10/07 which probably means October 2007, but either way this will not have suffered much. Anyway, when I pointed this out at the register it was given to me at 75 cents - RESULT!
Very healthy pop on opening (good sign), and a good looking pour into the Duvel tulip. The body color is darker (and better looking) than a Dubbel and has a good head and some lace.
Nose is a VERY rich combo of fruits, marzipan and some liquor - very good and in line with the style. Very nice.
Better than the Blonde version.
Taste is also nice. Plenty of figs and rolling sweet, dark fruits. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side, and this is the downfall of the beer. Stiil it manages to deliver and the beers drinks miles below the advertised 9.00% ABV. VERY drinkable, and a good example of the style, IF a little thin."

EXACTLY as expected. Golden yellow appearance, fading head, no lace.
Cooked veggies, corn additions, NOT clean and a thin mouthfeel complete the macro lager experience. NOT good and quite watery.
Difficult to finish outside of a BOILING hot outdoor event. No point otherwise.
UGH..."

I've given JP plenty of grief in the past for putting funk into ALL of their beers when to me it is only appropriate with SOME styles, and NOT appropriate all over the map. I stand by that assertion, and I still get annoyed when we get funk, Brett and acid in beers that shouldn't have them. Having said that, here's a style that ought to lend itself wll to the JP treatment, so I expecting a nice brew.
Poured into the Duvel tulip we get a great looking, golden orange body with frothy, big bubbly head but not a great deal of lace.
Typical scrumpy nose. A healhty dose of acid and a touch of calvados amongst the green apple skins.
The tastes encompass the full range of what you would expect; Brett, acid, apples, a touch of lemon, very light white pepper, BUT no sign of the oak aging. A very clean beer. Scrumpy manure notes cut across the finish in the best Somerset and evon traditions!
Good to drink a JP that tastes as the style SHOULD!"
Harviestoun Brewery Ltd.,Ola Dubh Special Reserve 12,,,Old Ale,8.00%,bottle,4.1,4,4.5,4,4,4,6/7/2008,"Motor oil pour as usual with no lace, but a nice ring and thin film of mocha head sitting on the surface.
Nose is big on the whisky aroma and it is light and tempting - very easy. 
Obviously a malty monster with plenty of mild raostiness. This is my favorite of the three cask aged Ola Dubh beers, it seems the most balanced and smoothest. Still quite earthy in the finish (that I do not care for much), but this feature seems to be the most reserved in this beer as opposed to the others in the series. 
Finishes with a pleasing, light alcoholic warmth."
"Adnams plc, Sole Bay Brewery",Adnams Regatta,,,English Bitter,4.30%,on-tap,2.73,2.5,3,3,2.5,2,6/6/2008,"From notes, Summer 2007 when I drank this at ""On the Waterfront"" in Exeter, Devon, England. Spent MANY, many happy hours at this pub eating the ""dustbin lids"" pizza's as a student - now I'm back with the wife and kids! GULP.
Well - what a shock! Adnams is a brewery that I have GREAT respect for, and generally I love their beers, but this was a HORRIBLE disappointment. Essentially a lager, and not a very good one at that. I guess this is simply one of these, dumbed down Golden Ales that have been popular in England over the last few years - a tradegy IMO, but there you go.
Summer drinking potential, but to be honest this is not an English Bitter at all.
This is SUCH a shame to me - a great brewer that makes great beers and this is problematic on two levels. Firstly it's just not a good beer, but more importantly it makes me sad to see Adnams stoop to this level."
Rogue Brewery (Brewer's on the Bay),Half-E-Weizen,,,Witbier,4.80%,bottle,3.4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,6/6/2008,"Recently arrived in GA (along with Dad's Little Helper) as an addition to the Rogue line-up.
I was a little concerned about this beer because I thought that a Rogue Witbier would just be another style that they would add too many hops to, and in the process take the thing out of style and screw it up. There WAS a touch of extra and unnecessary hop bite in the finish, AND the aftertaste was way too soap like for my taste, but overall it was better than I expected, and it was a little truer to style than some of their brews.
Golden yellow, hazed pour which is definitely darker than many Wit's and more Hefe like. Decent head and lace in the Tucher Weizen 0.5L. 
Mild, malty pepper not in the nose - not much else.
Definite herbal and lemon notes up front that fade to exaggerate the metallic ending.
In the end a pretty tasty and nicer beer than I expected. Good job."
Left Hand Brewing Company,Chainsaw Ale,,,American Strong Ale,9.00%,bottle,3,3,3,3,3,3,6/5/2008,"750 mL corked & caged bottle.
Cloudy and hazed mid-orange/brown body. Nice head, some sticky lace. The color and lack of clarity make this a somewhat unattractive beer. Looks a bit drab. Head and lace are better than the color.
Nose reveals a huge, brown sugar type aroma with only a slight, background like solvent alcohol note.
This is one sweet brew and with the combination of the hops I get an enormous mouthful of coconut. Quite a sickly sweet beer to me, and this is coming from someone that loves sweet brews. I think the problem for me is that this doesn't seem to have sweetness from malts, rather from just pure under fermented sugars. As a result, this is pretty slick and sticky in the mouth.
Truth be known I didn't care for this much and in addition I don't think that is a very good beer at all."
Mikkeller,Draft Bear,,,American Double / Imperial Pilsner,8.00%,bottle,3.58,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,6/5/2008,"$11.99 from Green's, Buford Highway, Atlanta, GA, USA. Silver foil covered neck in the corked & caged 750 mL bottle. Nasty, synthetic cork - I dislike these.
Partially poured into the 22oz Terrapin snifter - seems like the perfect glass for this beer. A slightly darker, golden pour with good head and some lace. 
I can't quite nail the nose, but it does seem a bit fruity.
A little more bitter, but at the same time also a little smoother than the other Imperial Pilsners I have had. The malt liquor, sweet, cloying elements seem to be quashed a little. Finish is actually quite lingering and metallic. Almost a little pepper in the finish too. A bit more IPA influence than I was expecting for the style.
An interesting diversion, but expensive for what it is and not the best Imperial Pilsner I have tasted. NOT Mikkeller's best brew."
Allagash Brewing Company,Allagash Musette,,,Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy,10.00%,bottle,4.05,4,4,4,4.5,4,6/1/2008,"$12.99 from Jax, Sandy Springs, Atlanta, GA, USA. Corked & Caged 750 mL bottle. Decent pop on opening. March 2008 bottling, apparently 650 cases were bottled. In the Duvel tulip is produces a thin, creamy surface head. No lace on the glass.
Nose seems like a classic Belgian Dark with plenty of candied sugar notes with a little touch of yeast.
Interesting brew this one from all kinds of angles. 
The BA database has this as Wee Heavy/Scotch, and the color (a deep mahogany), and the slightly sweet, mildly smoked tastes suggest this is true. However, it seems like the yeast strain and sweet sugars still manage to add the classic, Allagash Belgian influence.
The next thing I'm interested in is the oaking. Generally I'm not to keen on Oak Aged stuff, but this seems VERY mild in that department, and it has the effect of creating a warmth in the alcohol and a pleasing bitterness at the end of the drink. Nice.
Interesting. Finishes with a touch more smoke and a warming alcoholic rush and the residual sugar is left. Tasty.
Probably my least favorite of the Victor, Victoria and Musette range but still a very nice beer."
Wells & Young's Ltd,Summer Solstice,,,American Blonde Ale,4.10%,cask,4,3,4,4,3.5,4.5,6/1/2008,"Taken from notes, Summer 2007. Drank a couple of pints of this at The Bear in Esher, Surrey with my good friend Dave - thanks Dave!
Striking light colored pour that the name would suggest. Thin head. Another of the ever popular English ""Golden Ales"", I think this should be added to the BA database as a style, despite the fact that I don't really care for them much!
Light freshly mown grass in the nose, and a distinct yest note that carries over to the taste. Although not a ""hoppy"" beer by ANY stretch of the imagination, this does deliver both a citrus tang AND a mildly bitter aftertaste. Nice, light and simple balance.
Also VERY refreshing. Obviously has ""Summer quencher"" written all over it, and the beer pulls off a nice combo of taste and lightness.
Not my favorite style of beer by any means, but I was surprised at the quality and how much I enjoyed drinking this. A good, solid example and one that I could certainly see going back to."
Big Boss Brewing,Hell's Belle,,,Belgian Pale Ale,7.00%,bottle,3.18,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,5/31/2008,"12oz single from Sam's Blue Light, Durham, NC, USA. Badly misaligned notches on the label do not help, but it looks like this was bottled in Jan '07. ABV given as 7%.
Lemon colored body with a lively (in fact somewhat fizzy head) that fades quickly. Some spotty surface lace and a little on the glass. It looks like it might be a triple.
Nose has some mild funk that goes beyond the usual Belgian yeast.
I dunno, this drinks like a Biere de Garde more than a Belgian Pale. A lot of extra funk and barnyard than there should be. Light acid/lemon in the taste. Finishes with some light yeast notes, but this seems all out of whack for the style for me."
Brasserie Val De Sambre,Abbaye D'Aulne Triple Blonde 9°,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,9.00%,bottle,3.48,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,5/31/2008,"750 mL corked and ""braced"" (as opposed to caged). No: 144302 on the cork. Best Before 03/10/07 which almost certainly means Oct 3 2007. Past that date, but I have no qualms about the ability of this beer to withstand that.
Healthy pop on the release of the cork. Poured into the Abbaye des Rocs chalice it provides a simple, golden honey colored hazy body, a lively but light head, and some nice lace.
Very light in the mouth and lacks much body. There is a white pepper note about the beer (in the aroma and the taste), but very little alcohol presence considering the ABV and it lacks a great deal of character. Finishes with a tiny note of bitterness amongst the thin fruits.
A bit like a ""Belgian Strong Pale Lite""! Not much sense in that statement I know, but that's what it feels like.
One of my favorite styles, but if truth be known a pretty average example."
Allagash Brewing Company,Allagash Victor Ale,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,9.00%,bottle,4.7,4,4,5,4.5,5,5/30/2008,"$12.99 from Jax, Sandy Springs, Atlanta, GA, USA for the 750 mL corked & caged affair.
Poured into the tall, stemmed, Abbaye des Roc Chalice to reveal a honey colored body with a small head that fades to give a surface of foam and a tiny amount of lace.
Nose has light alcohol, and the mild, solvent like character associated with wine - the grape notes coming through strong.
This is NOT a Belgian Strong Dark by any stretch of the imagination. It's much more like a Belgian Strong Pale with some Champagne character coming through too. Full and creamy in the mouth, the carbonation is perfectly understated. A light acidity accompanies the finish and the alcohol, although present, is really nowhere to be seen in terms of its power. very light tart notes, but very reserved.
VERY subtle, light and delicate, another one of those beers that you could happily substitute for wine or a mild aperitif or toasting option.
I think this is classy - Allagash rarely misses, and this is another fine example of a beer that is streets ahead in terms of class."
Avery Brewing Company,Avery Anniversary Ale - Fifteen,,,American Wild Ale,7.70%,bottle,4.63,4,5,4.5,4,5,5/30/2008,"22 oz bomber from Green's Atlanta, GA, USA. $5.99 (I think).
I had a quick look at the reviews on BA before drinking this, and I understand where people are coming from. HOWEVER, I really think that I have HUGE advantage over many of those BA's who have reviewed the beer so far. I was born in Devon, England, and was raised for a large part of my life in the county and close to the Somerset border. As a result, I KNOW, REAL West Country Scrumpy (Cider) VERY well - I was raised on it. This is a beer that is based in the those great, farmhouse, rustic traditions. Coming from that point of view gives me a perspective that few will have.
Pour is a slighted hazed, light orange body with a fizzy, bubbly head that fades to almost nothing except a wispy presence on the surface of the brew.
The beer is classically smelly. A combo of acid, apples, manure, farmhouse funk and slightly putrid water - FANTASTIC!
Very light and refreshing it has all of the requisite elements for a rustic beverage. A sweet and sour combo. Many white wine characteristics. Light grape notes (with the associated acidity), and plenty of warmth. Dry, champagne like finish. Tasty.
Delicious beer, but you need some perspective to appreciate this. Think GENUINE Scrumpy and you'll be halfway there."
Spanish Peaks Brewing Co.,Crystal Weiss,,,Kristalweizen,4.50%,bottle,3.38,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,5/29/2008,"Picked up as a single as part of Mac's, mixed 12oz single for $7.99, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Poured into the Tucher Weizen 0.5 L weizen glass. Honey yellow/golden pour, I would describe this is a bit darker than usual. Great clarity, a decent head and ""better than I was expecting"" lace. Looks half-decent, but it is helped by the glass.
Some freshly cut grass, as well as some sweet, alcohol, skunky Euro Lager notes in the initial taste. A tiny, tiny hint of Saaz in the finish but it is minimal.
Drinks well. Refreshing and pretty smooth, a half decent hot weather beer for drinking in the right context. Not much more.
Expect very little and you'll probably not be too disappointed. It's a simple version and there are (obviously) better out there, but I wouldn't turn away a couple of bottles at the pool."
Terrapin Beer Company,Terrapin Oak Aged Rye Squared,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,9.00%,on-tap,2.5,3,3,2,3.5,2.5,5/29/2008,"On tap, Brick Store, Decatur, GA, USA.
Happened to share the first pint of this with pghlee when it was tapped at the Brick Store for the first time. I *think* that this is similar (if not the same) to a version that was tasted at the Atlanta Cask tasting in Jan '08; I didn't care for it much then, nor do I care for it now.
The pour is an orange brown, with a lot of chill haze and murkiness. Head is not relevant and the lace is scant.
In a nutshell there is just WAY too much going on here. To be frank I think it is a bit clumsy. When you are starting with a beer like Rye Squared, you are already at the VERY edge of sensible limits of complexity and taste, and adding an oak/age/barrel character just takes this beer out of the zone for me. It gets overly complicated and its drinkability drops off dramatically.
There are too many competing elements here. I get mouthfuls of smoke, wood, hops, malt and alcohol, and combination is not one that is complex in a good way, rather it becomes a cluttered mess - not organized or controlled.
IMO, a poor choice of beer to complicate further, and ""kow-towing"" to the latest trend in oak is simply a BAD idea with this beer. Also VERY exensive kegs for what it is. Poor value."
Kiuchi Brewery,Commemorative Ale,,,Herbed / Spiced Beer,9.00%,bottle,3.03,2,5,2.5,3,2.5,5/27/2008,"$4.49, 12oz stubbie from Arbor Place Beverage, Douglasville, GA, USA. Part of the relatively recent influx of craft beer after the new ownership at Arbor Place.
Insane carbonation - off the charts for most beers, but for the style uterly ridiculous. Completely opaque, murky orange body. Head is HUGE and nosiy with te carbonation being so high. No lace speaks to the lack of substance in the head.
Nose is an extraordinary yeast, funky bomb - not unpleasant but very obvious.
Very sweet with some spice notes but it's really syrupy and herbal. Not in style at all.
Another odd beer from this brewer. Some people rave about their stuff, but I just don't see it often."
Shmaltz Brewing Company (He'Brew),He'Brew Rejewvenator (Year Of The Fig) 2008,,,American Strong Ale,7.80%,bottle,3.98,3.5,4,4,4,4,5/27/2008,"I've been delighted by He'Brew so far so I was excited to try this. I was not let down, enjoyable.
$4.99 from Green's, Atlanta, GA, USA. 22oz bomber. Partial pour into the Harpoon IPA 500mL glass. Great clarity in the reddish, amber body. Slight reddish hint to the head too. Head is short lived and lace is scant.
This is simply a BIG, sweet malt bomb. Hints of tasty fruits (that I was not necessarily be able to tdistinguish as Figs) but they are dark and rich in their nature. 
Hint of warming alcohol in the finish along with a touch of hoppy bitterness. Warming on the way down. Aftertaste has some nice sherry notes and some lingering metallic, warming alcohol.
Tasty, and unusual - kind of a sweeter, fruity version of an Arrogant Bastard. Nice."
Teignworthy Brewery,Spring Tide,,,English Bitter,4.30%,bottle,4.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,5/27/2008,"Taken from notes, Summer 2007. Drunk in several East and South Devon venues both on Cask and in bottles. This is the bottle version review.



Pour gives a low carbonated, simple amber body but the lace is very pronounced considering the head. It's simple, well balanced malts all the way, with a slight hop bite in the finish. Sessionable features (if a touch on the high ABV side), but it all works well.



Typical of the style, very easy drinking and nothing much to report outside of a solid version of the style with plenty of character and drinkability."
"Bell's Brewery, Inc.",Bell's Consecrator Doppelbock,,,Doppelbock,8.00%,bottle,3.98,3.5,4,4,4,4,5/25/2008,"12oz bottle from Sam's Blue Light, Durham, NC, USA. Typical dark amber, clear body with a large initial head that fades quickly. No lace.
Typical for the style, at least a solid American example. 
The toasty, liquor based notes; the prominent alcohol; the creamy, sherry like flavor; and the warming, Old Ale feel are all there.
Nice, oily, slightly slick mouthfeel. Finishes with an appropriate dry, bitterness.
Tasty."
Unibroue,Unibroue 17,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,10.00%,bottle,4.58,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5/25/2008,"750 mL Corked & Caged bottle with the usual Unibroue, silk screened presentation. $8.49 from Bullocks, Marietta, GA, USA. Had a bit of a job to track this down.
Big pop on opening, it's poured into the Ommegang chalice. Dirty brown, Dubbel like color (not attractive) with a high head that is dense, creamy and off-white (this IS attractive). Nice lace.
Big, herbal nose with some interesting notes of freshly cut green leaves - quite odd! Mint? Very, very, very mild smoke??
Large alcohol presence, but this is VERY smooth. Dark fruits abound, but there is a big white pepper entity in there too. Also a certain red wine, tannin dryness as well; it comes together very nicely. Complex to the point of having some Quad like character. As it warms there is more licorice.
As far as the drinkability goes, the alcohol IS there but it doesn't seem to manifest itself in an aggressive way. Drinks as a ""big"" beer, but at the same time below the 10.00%.
Very creamy in the mouth.
I detect a slight movement away from the typical Unibroue Big Belgian to a more distinctive, almost unique beer. They do a nice job here and it is unusual but successful."
BFM Brasserie Des Franches-Montagnes,Jurassian Imperial Stout (Cuvée Alex Le Rouge),,,American Double / Imperial Stout,10.30%,bottle,1.7,2.5,2.5,1.5,1,1.5,5/24/2008,"Oh dear. Relatively new addition to the Atlanta market, luckily for me I didn't buy one, rather Dave popped a research bottle at The Brick Store this past Friday afternoon.
Small bottle (11.2oz perhaps), Grolsch flip top presentation with an ABV given to THREE decimal places - that's the Swiss for you! Label is red and white with gives the impression of some Communist, Eastern Bloc origin!
Pour is black with little or no head - fair enough, considering the ABV that matches. Very slight, thin mocha ring around the surface.
Nose and tastes reveal the dark, roasted malts, but this beer has a nasty, lactose-like acidity and is thin beyond belief considering the (claimed) style and the ABV.
Extremely poor, avoid IMO."
Boulder Beer / Wilderness Pub,Mojo IPA,,,American IPA,7.20%,bottle,4.13,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,5/24/2008,"12oz bottle as a single from Mac's Midtown as part of their $7.99 mixed sixer. A recent addition to the Atlanta market, but I have had a few Boulder beers before so I wasn't expecting any surprises; there were none.
Golden pour with a light and fluffy head. Large bubbles form meaning the head is not a dense one. Light wispy lace is attractive. Looks really nice in 500mL Harpoon IPA glass.
Bold hop nose lets you know immediately what you are dealing with - a SOLID American IPA. Slightly medicinal aroma of largish hops.
Tastes are well balanced with a good malt backbone supporting the obvious hop presence. Some fruits in there, and this drinks with an interesting combination of very bold dry character and light fruit. Highly drinkable, light and refreshing, BUT I'm never gonna have more than a couple of these for two reasons;
1. It's (and so often the American style of IPA in general) just too aggressive for me to enjoy anywhere near a sixer, and
2. I would really LOVE a similar beer coming in at half the ABV.
Whilst I DO like this beer, it seems to be a quintessential example of the weakness in American craft brewing in general. It would STILL be a great beer (and infinitely more drinkable) with half the hops and half the alcohol. Shame it isn't."
New Glarus Brewing Company,Unplugged Belgian Quadruple,,,Quadrupel (Quad),?,bottle,4.18,3.5,4,4,4,5,5/24/2008,"Lucked upon this at the Brick Stone on a Friday afternoon; thanks to Dave and some other (nameless) benefactor. 12 oz bottle.
The pour was a simple, light brown with some chill haze and minimal carbonation. I'd be curious to know the ABV for a head/carbonation reference point. Nose reveals some Belgian sugar notes, a touch of yeast, a very mild funk but not much else. Impressive light touch.
A mild-funk starts the taste experience which is followed by a sweet and sour combo. Very light, refreshing and tasty. Impressive brew. One thing that stayed with me was the drinkablity and the light nature of the beer. Sweet!"
Rogue Brewery (Brewer's on the Bay),Brewer's Ale 2008,,,American Strong Ale,9.00%,on-tap,3.18,4.5,3,3,4,3,5/23/2008,"Difficult to be absolutely sure if this is the correct listing for the beer that I had at lunchtime today, but for now I think it may be for the following reasons;
1. I drank it at Summit's in Snellville which has a ""special"" relationship with Rogue.
2. The one other review seems to resemble what I drank.
3. It was listed at the bar as ""Brewer Ale"".
Anyway, a very dark brown pour with a pretty lively, frothy head. The head eventually settles down to yield some nice, spotty and creamy lace. The beer was served in a frozen glass (what the HELL is wrong with these people), so the nose was tricky to pick up, but it was hop-based (perhaps a hint of citrus pine a la Rogue).
Tastes have some malt upfront with a hint of chocolate powder, but as per usual with Rogue the hops take over and kill the ending. It cuts across the ending and leaves a very severe bitterness.
I dunno, the whole Rogue experience on draft seems to end up this way for me way too often. It seems harsh and metallic in the end, and is ultimately rather disappointing."
Kona Brewing Company,Fire Rock Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),5.80%,on-tap,3.83,3.5,3,4,3.5,4.5,5/22/2008,"Recently arrived in GA, I must admit that I really wasn't too excited to try this - I thought that it had too much potential just to be ""another Pale Ale"" taking up shelf space. In the end it was much better than expected.
On-tap at the Brockett Pub, Clarkston, GA and subsequently at Taco Mac, Marietta.
Nice looking reddish/brown pour, but served waay too cold. When it warmed a little it revealed a solid malt backbone that really was pretty sweet. I really enjoyed the deep malts. I would imagine that this would be a little too sweet for some, but it fit my taste profile really well. Brown sugar notes, and a refreshing carbonation that I found very appealing and tasty.
It reminded me of something that I just cannot place for now, but it will come back to me."
Piccolo Birrificio,Seson,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,6.00%,on-tap,3.53,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,5/18/2008,"On tap at the Brick Store, Decatur, GA, USA.
Golden, mildly hazed pour with some cloudiness and yellow highlights.
Good lace on top of the smallish head.
The usual funk character, but a very earthy note to this. The organic nature seems to make this beer feel a little rough; almost like a homebrewed Saison. Here the emphasis is definitely on the Farmhouse side of things. The earthy taste was almost literal, with a hint of soil being in the taste! Strange.
Actually it drank better than my description above, suggests, but it certainly wasn't/isn't one I would buy, seek out or bother with again."
Southern Tier Brewing Company,Unearthly (Imperial India Pale Ale),,,American Double / Imperial IPA,10.00%,bottle,2.95,4,3.5,3,3,2,5/18/2008,"22oz bomber (partially) into the Terrapin 22oz snifter - a nice combo! Picked this one up at State Line.
Pour is a mid to dark orange with a nice head from the aggressive pour (I thought the aggression would be a good idea because with the ABV the head was likely to be limited). It does fade quickly to leave some decent lace and some spotty, creamy film.
Nose has the requisite pine and grapefruit notes. 
Tastes are typical for the style. Grapefruit is there, but the bitterness is really quite harsh. Nothing subtle about this, and ultimately I think it is way too big for its britches. Slow burn on the way down completes the unbalanced package. It's just VERY difficult to make a beer this ENORMOUS in terms of hops and ABV, and still end up with something that is drinkable. For me, this fails somewhat.
Dry, burning finish. Unbalanced and rough.
I am always wary of cracking one of these bombers of such a HUGE beer and I really struggled to finish this. Not sure if that is a function of the beer or the style, but for me this was just a little too much."
Allagash Brewing Company,Allagash Victoria Ale,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,9.00%,bottle,4.7,4,4.5,5,3.5,5,5/17/2008,"Not retired unless this is a new recipe and therefore a different brew. I passed on this when I was in Greensboro, NC in November as it was quite pricey. Now it has made it to GA in the latest wave of Allagash products to come into the state, and I'm delighted.
$12.99 from Jax in Sandy Springs, GA, USA for the 750 mL, corked & caged bottle. Green lettering for the Allagash name.
Poured into the new, 22oz(!) Terrapin snifter, this looks great. A great choice to christen the new glass. Lovely honey colored body with a thin film of fine bubbled head on the surface. Some lace, but I don't think that the glass (as attractive and nice as it is) retains it very well.
Nose has some yeast, alcohol and plenty of green fruits. Promises much.
The taste delivers on the nose. Delicious, edgy vinous quality that brings together a great white pepper, wine, Belgian Pale, yeast, alcohol combo with a very small hint of Belgian sugar. Dry, alcohol based finish cuts is as well, but not before the fruitiness and alcohol have combined to deliver a sweet and sour tart and boozy mixture that hits the spot beautifully.
Mouthfeel is the weakest part of this beer with a little prickly carbonation that could be toned down a little. Doesn't really subtract from the beer, but it was a touch sharp.
I thought I would really like this, and I was right. A CRACKING brew - delicious."
De Proefbrouwerij (bvba Andelot),La Grande Blanche,,,Witbier,7.50%,on-tap,4.18,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,5/17/2008,"Wits used to be one of my favorite styles, but of late I've been enjoying them less so I was pleased when this one was better than expected.
On-tap at The Brick Store, Decatur, GA, USA.
Classic, lemon yellow, hazed pour with an attractive, dense looking head and some superb lace. The mouthfeel seemed to add an extra dimension compared to many examples of the style. A bit fuller than usual.
All the classic Wit notes with an extra dimension of mild tart apples. The extra ""funk"" associated with this beer tends to make it lean toward a less well defined Wit and perhaps even over into Saison categories. It reminds me very much of a mild (yet funky) Devonshire Cider. Definitely barnyard notes in the nose and the taste.
As I say, a little out of the ordinary for the style, but in a good way - tasty. Drinkability was good on a warm Atlanta afternoon."
Rogue Brewery (Brewer's on the Bay),Oregon Golden Ale,,,American Blonde Ale,?,bottle,3.25,2.5,3,3.5,2.5,3.5,5/13/2008,"22oz bomber from State Line Liquors purchased under the Sharktooth moniker. I think it was $4.99.
Golden/Orange hazed and cloudy pour. Head and lace are unimpressive. Nose is a light lemon. Some noisy, and prickly carbonation. Quite bubbly in the mouth. Body is Hefe like.
Tastes are interesting with a yeasty background with some citrus notes. In fact, if I had to sum this up I would call it VERY reminiscent of a typical British Lager Shandy. Lots of lemonade (British, NOT American), which imparts a sweetish edge to the beer. Finishes with a shortish, soapy hoppy note.
Quite drinkable if unspectacular brew."
Barrel House Brewing Company,Hocking Hills Hefeweizen,,,Hefeweizen,4.00%,bottle,2.08,3.5,2.5,2,2,1.5,5/11/2008,"22oz bottle from Cheers, Carrollton, GA, USA. I think this is an aged bottle, but with no dates on the bottle I feel FULLY justified in reviewing this.
Lemon/Butterscotch body with a small head a little lace. Looks OK and reminds me a little of the Widmer Bros. version. Looks OK, but that's where the good stuff ends.
Acidity is high, and the watery nature of the brew and lack of depth, body and character says it all. 
Very poor example of the style IMO, that lacks any kind of clove or banana note - avoid."
Brauerei Heller-Trum / Schlenkerla,Aecht Schlenkerla Helles Lagerbier,,,Munich Helles Lager,4.30%,bottle,2.45,3,2.5,2,3,3,5/11/2008,"500 mL bottle, $3.99 from Arbor Place Beverage, Douglasville, GA, USA. Been meaning to try this for a long time, finally got around to it this weekend.
Amazing yellow clarity in the body with a short lived head and no lace. Macro lager appearance.
I thought I was losing my mind when I tasted this up front. There was smoke! Mild but noticeable nonetheless. Apparently, the beer becomes ""smoked"" just by virtue of the fact that it passes through the brewery where all of the other smoked beers are made. To me, this is a flawed approach.
Typical, Euro lager, grainy/veggy nose - very ordinary. No smoke in the smell.
Quite bitter, with a coinage metallic taste being the overwhelming taste. Smoke cuts across he finish in a very obvious way, and lingers on the palate to maintain the significant bitterness.
Not my cup of tea at all."
"Anheuser-Busch, Inc.",Shock Top Belgian White,,,Witbier,5.20%,on-tap,1.4,3,1.5,1,3,1,5/10/2008,"Review #1500 - a bit sad.
Very happy to drink anything once, and this is no exception. It was described to me as ""Blue Moon with more orange flavor"" - OOOKaaaayyy?? We'll see.
16oz pour, Taco Mac, Douglasville, GA, USA.
Head is large over an obviously orange colored, cloudy body. Nose reveals virtually nothing. Head is lively, carbonated and short lived.
Taste is NASTY - all I get is dishwasher soap. There is simply nothing else to report. Blue Moon is an infinitely better beer, and that is saying something!
I couldn't drink this. That happens VERY infrequently, but there you are. Some A-B products ARE drinkable - this ISN'T."
"Anheuser-Busch, Inc.",Michelob Hop Hound Amber Wheat,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,5.30%,on-tap,2.08,3,1.5,2.5,2,1.5,5/10/2008,"16oz pour at Taco Mac, Douglasville, GA, USA. An ""Amber Wheat"" (whatever THAT is), so here we go.
Pour has an amber colour with a decent head and some lace. Nose to me appears to be non-descript.
Taste lacks any depth, description or character. I'd describe it as malt based with a watery consistency.
Not offensive, but that's about as far as my praise will go with this. Happy to give A-B credit where it is due, but that's NOT here. Marginal taste, and a bland offering in the extreme. I'm assuming that is is a ""lifestyle"" product for the season from the marketing masters - in terms of ""BEER"", it's all VERY sad.
AVOID."
Boulevard Brewing Co.,Dry Stout,,,Irish Dry Stout,5.20%,bottle,3.43,3,3,3.5,3,4,5/10/2008,"12oz stubbie bottle - a single. Pretty sure that this was left over from the CEO/Old Farts BIF, thanks to Vancer.
Black body with some orange highlights deep in the sampling glass. Head is gone quickly to reveal little or no lace.
Nose is promising with plenty of character with some milk chocolate malt notes.
First taste is quite bitter and the mouthfeel is rather thin. Typical mild roast with a touch of smoke - not much. A definite yeasty character which the label suggests is coming from the added yeast and the bottle conditioning.
Light and easy to drink, this feels like quite a thirst quencher. Finish is dryish (but not overwhelming) and this brew sits OK with me. Not something that I would consider buying in the bottle, but on tap and fresh I'd imagine it could be a satisfactory beer.
OK, and slightly above average."
Ølfabrikken,Ølfabrikken Abbey Ale (Special Reserve),,,Dubbel,8.50%,bottle,4.38,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,5/10/2008,"750 mL Corked & Caged from Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA. Non-descript cork.
I was a little wary of this simply because I am not a big fan of Dubbel's, but this (at least HALF) broke the mould.
Poured into the Ommegang Chalice, the beer shows an exceptional color for a Dubbel. I am giving this a ""5"" for appearance based upon the fact that most Dubbel's have a HORRIBLE, nasty dirty dishwasher appearance. This has much more clarity, a better ""red"" color and head and lace that is well above average.
Aroma has some Belgian yeast and some mild acidity. Pungent, but in a good way.
Very impressed with this Dubbel. NOT my favorite style by any stretch of the imagination, but this beer nicely treads the fine line between acidity and Belgian character. It pulls the combo off nicely with plenty of sugary notes, yeast character and a mouthfeel that holds the package together.
VERY nice, definitely one of my favorite Dubbels of all time. Strange that it took a non-Belgian brewer to do this, but perhaps I'm just not a huge fan of the authentic, and just prefer the slightly bastardized!
Tasty!"
Saint Louis Brewery / Schlafly Tap Room,Schlafly Oatmeal Stout,,,Oatmeal Stout,5.70%,bottle,2.38,3,2.5,2.5,2,2,5/10/2008,"12oz single, possibly left over from the CEO/Old Farts BIF - if so, thanks Vancer.
Black pour into the sampler glass with some orange/red highlights in the bottom of the glass. Head and (sparce) lace are bone white.
Thin body and non-descript nose.
VERY light on taste. Lacks bitterness, smoke, caramel or significant malt/chocolate notes, this is a pretty average example of the style by any stretch of the imagination. Especially lacking considering this is an ""oatmeal"" version rather than a dry stout. Some significant acidity in the finish and also seems over-carbonated.
Poor beer IMO."
Shipyard Brewing Co.,Blue Fin Stout,,,Irish Dry Stout,4.70%,bottle,2.93,3.5,3,3,3,2.5,5/10/2008,"12oz single comes with a notched label with a ""Best Before"" date.
Poured into the sampler glass, this gives a jet black body with minimal orange/red highlights. An espresso colored head, and some very scant lace.
A somewhat fishy/lactose character to the taste which is not that attractive. Certainly dry, but it really lacks the subtlety of some other, better dry stouts. This has more bitterness up front, and doesn't really produce an especially drinkable beer.
Mouthfeel lacks presence, and a lingering acidity reduces drinkability and the desire for more.
Another beer hat I bet would be infinitely better on-tap, fresh and near the source. Ho-Hum, it's one and done."
Breckenridge Brewery,SummerBright Ale,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,4.50%,bottle,2.55,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,5/9/2008,"12oz single as part of the Mac's Midtown, Atlanta, GA, USA mixed sixer at $7.99. Light macro body, little head and no lace. Clarity is good - filtred wheat??
I dunno, along with the thinnish body, the macro grainy smell and the relatively tasteless nature of the style, this beer fails to impress. To be honest, I think it is a problem with the style as much as anything else - it just does NOT inspire on any level.
Sometimes I get the feeing that breweries use ""Summer"" as an excuse to produce something bland. This could be so much more and Breckenridge is much better than this beer.
Very, very mild hop bitterness in the finish that is a touch Pils like, but frankly this hardly saves the beer.
Disappointing to me."
Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,Sierra Nevada Torpedo Extra IPA,,,American IPA,7.20%,on-tap,3.03,3.5,3.5,3,3,2.5,5/9/2008,"On-tap at The Brick Store, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Whatever. What's the point in SN producing yet ANOTHER hoppy beer? I just don't get it. In the wake of so many others in their portfolio, this is just another average, hoppy brew.
Golden yellow (macro like) pour with a semi-decent head. Hoppy aroma which is obviously translated into the taste. Overbearing hops - not in a very aggressive way, but just unbalanced and mediocre. Tired. Seems like a cross between the PA, The Harvest and the (HA, HA!) ""ESB"". A bit of a waste of time and spce.
Uninteresting to me in the extreme. Why bother with this AGAIN?"
Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,Sierra Nevada ESB (Early Spring Beer),,,Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB),5.90%,bottle,2.85,3,3,3,2.5,2.5,5/9/2008,"I Absolutely DESPISE the use of the letters ESB to mean Early Spring Beer; it is both deceptive and classless. This is NOT an ESB, so if we are going to rate this on style it gets a F grade. I'll resist that temptation, JUST.
12oz stubbie bottle from the original six pack from The Wine Shop on Johnson Ferry Road, Marietta, GA, USA.
Pour is a dark orange body with a thinnish looking white head. A little lace. Carbonation is way too high.
Nose is mainly mild, sweet hops but not much else.
Lightly hopped pale ale is where I put this. ESB it AIN'T. Finish is a little too dry for my liking. Of course, what this really adds up to is just ANOTHER SN, hop-based beer which is a really non-offensive but is so bland. Why do they bother with so many of this clone-like brews?"
Hook Norton Brewery Co. Ltd.,Double Stout,,,English Stout,4.80%,bottle,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,5/8/2008,"Classy, 500 mL bottle poured into Harpoon 0.5L glass. Green's on Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA. $4.99 I think.
Dark, dark brown with some reddish/black highlights. The head is great, and the lace substantial. Looks really nice.
Smooth, easy drinking with a lovely dryish taste that is mellow and well balanced. Light licorice notes, very mild roastiness and some buttery bread. Mild, sweet roasted notes in the nose.
Simple beer, that is well crafted with low ABV and very easy to drink. This is SO typical of a well made British beer - not because of the style, but because of the subtle, simple drinkability that is not hidden behind huge layers of alcohol and hops. Just a well crafted product that is tasty, drinkable and easy.
Delicious."

2010 vintage 05/13/10

Fresher hop taste and much ""greener"" than I remember in the past. The beer seems a little darker too, with a more bitter, metallic finish than I remember. Al in all the beer seems more aggressive and has a harder edge than in"
Abita Brewing Co.,Strawberry Harvest Lager,,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,4.20%,bottle,2.58,2.5,3.5,2,2.5,3,5/7/2008,"12oz single bottle from Mac's Midtown, Atlanta, GA, USA. Part of the mixed sixer for $7.99.
Not a big fan of Abita in general, so coupled with the style, I did not have high hopes. The beer turned out to be marginally more drinkable than expected, but not really anything I could imagine buying ever again.
Poured from the 12oz stubbie (with the annoying label that has dates on it but that were NOT notched) into the Tucher Weizen 0.5L glass.
Very light yellow pour, with some mild chill haze and some ill-defined head and lace.
Mild strawberry ice-cream nose - that is to say there is a milkshake creaminess to it. Very little of this is reflected in the taste, so the beer seems just like a sweet, APA or wheat beer.
Very little character, but I guess that's the whole point. Easy drinking on a hot day, but there is a very fine line between this and a thousand other macro/light lagers. Not for me."
Bison Brewing Co.,Reunion '08,,,Rye Beer,6.50%,bottle,3.85,3,4,4,3,4,5/6/2008,"22oz bomber from Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA - $4.99 (I think). Delighted to have the opportunity to help a good cause, not so much bothered what the beer is like.
Amber body - good clarity; thin looking with a lack of significant head and lace. Thin in the mouth too. Some rye in the taste, but I have had one or two rye beers that have MUCH greater rye character (Terrapin). I like the somewhat muted rye notes.
Sweetish, sugary toffee/caramel nose. A bit popcorn like.
Despite the fact that the body is a little on the thin side, it still has a refreshing lightness about it, and I drank the 22oz pretty quickly. Carbonation seems low, and there is some caramel sweetness in the finish.
Don't know what the ABV is, but it drinks in a sessionable fashion, going down very easily.
Tasty and a simple belnd of hop bitterness against solid malts - it's OK."
Boulder Beer / Wilderness Pub,Sweaty Betty Blonde,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,5.90%,bottle,3.03,3.5,3,3,3,3,5/5/2008,"12oz single from Mac's Midtown as part of the $7.99 mixed sixer. Poured into the Tucher 0.5L Weizen glass. New entry to the GA market for this brewery. I've had a couple of others in the past, but this one is new to me.
Cloudy lemon color - standard. Small head and some ringed lace. Clean, medicinal nose - again standard.
As is the danger with the style, one can easily fail to pull it off with authority, and this tends to leave a slightly fizzy, watery and uninteresting beer - this falls into that category for me.
Bland is the word that springs to mind. Summer sipping, but it's one and done for me."
Anchor Brewing Company,Anchor Bock Beer,,,Bock,5.50%,bottle,3.7,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,5/4/2008,"This one has been a LONG time coming - glad to get here eventually. Not available in GA, this one came from a recent jaunt up the east coast. 8JW dot-matrixed in the usual Anchor manner. 
Good, mahogany color from a noisy pour. Rich body, head and lace - very nice looking. Head is very nicely retained with good lace.
Tastes lack a bit of sweetness that I was looking for, and have an almost tea-like taste. Good mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden. Some bitterness in the finish, but not much. Tannin lingers and coats the mouth a bit. Red ember highlights are very bright.
I guess that the beer lacks a little something. I think it is a combination of sweetness and alcohol that I was looking for more of to keep this in style. On reflection maybe I was expecting more of a Doppelbock (which may not be at all fair), either way I was left wanting a bit more."
"Bell's Brewery, Inc.",Bell's Cherry Stout,,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,7.00%,bottle,2.9,3,3,3,3,2.5,5/4/2008,"12 oz single. Sam's Blue Light, Durham, NC, USA.
The third time I've had this - first time review.
Pour is as black as night with (after the fizzing carbonation of the initial pour) no head or lace to speak of. Dead looking.
Thinnish body with an acidic nature to the beer. Definitely more fruit beer than stout, and I don't really care for this much. Sour is the main theme, without much of a fruit note. Finish is tart sweetness.
A very tiny lactose character in the finish.
All in all, a disappointment to me."
Flying Dog Brewery,Garde Dog,,,Bière de Garde,5.50%,bottle,2.88,2.5,2.5,3,3,3,5/4/2008,"12oz single from Mac's Midtown, Atlanta, GA, USA. Part of the $7.99 mixed sixer that they peddle.
Pour is a simple, dark urine colored body underneath a head that is gone very quickly to reveal virtually no lace. Small bubbles of carbonation do persist, but they do not seem to contribute to the head in any way.
Grassy and grainy nose, with a similar taste along with some extra sweetness. Some herbal hop notes, but the whole package is pretty muted. The macro-lager sweetness is a little cloying in the finish. Nothing too offensive, but in no way is this a very good representative beer for the style. I could drink a couple I suppose, but after that I would be annoyed that the beer is not a good reflection of a style that I like, and the slightly, sickly sweet notes might start getting to me.
Strikes me as a macro attempt at a far more complicated style. If I want a BdG, then I want a real one - not a pretender."
"Anheuser-Busch, Inc.",Bud Light Lime,,,Light Lager,4.20%,bottle,2.55,3,3,2,3,3,5/3/2008,"Well, it is what it is - no more, no less. Taco Mac, Douglasville, GA, USA - on the house!
Golden macro pour with a large white head. Very little lace and no retention to speak of.
Aroma is that of a traditional British, lager-shandy. The lime notes are not pronounced as lime, but more of as a British lemonade. Sweet, carbonated Sprite/R Whites like rather than citrusy.
Nose and aroma are not aggressive by any means. Slight citrus/lemon taste, but obviously nothing much else. Refeshing, but obviously zero character - I could have been drinking a seltzer water.
No harm, no foul. Probably my first and last, but I could suck a few of these back at the pool, on the beach or after mowing the lawn, but it would have to be free and MIGHTY hot.
Outside of that, not much to report. Fairly clean and non-offensive, but just about as far from beer for a BA that one can magine. A beverage for children and women."
De Proefbrouwerij (bvba Andelot),Saison Imperiale - Belgian Farmhouse Ale,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,8.50%,bottle,3.48,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,5/3/2008,"$8.99 from Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA for the 750 mL corked & caged bottle. Synthetic cork which I am simply not a big fan of - takes away the authenticity a little for me. Opens with an encouraging pop.
Poured into the Duvel tulip, this is much darker than I was expecting. Nice, dark metallic copper hue with a great head and nice lace. Head is well maintained, and is creamy/dreamy - thick. Unusual color for the style.
Nose has light citrus funk, against some more aggreesive vinegar character. The nose worries me a bit, since it seems rather acidic. Luckily, the taste does not have too much acid.
Tastes are a little more muted than the nose would suggest. Simple, light acidic funk - with a darker edge (to match the color) than I would expect for the style. As it warms there is a slightly increased caramel note.
Even some Rodenbach type notes!
A nice brew, but I must admit I prefer a ""lighter"" looking and tasting Saison. This is a touch too tangy for me."
Kiuchi Brewery,Hitachino Nest Red Rice Ale,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,7.00%,bottle,3,3,3,3,3,3,5/3/2008,"11.2oz bottle labeled as 7% ABV rather than the 8.5% listed in the BA database.
Orange/Red pour with very little sustainable head or lace. Hazy appearance.
Slightly acidic, apple based taste. Quite a high carbonation and not really in tune with the style as listed on BA.
Light fruits but not much there. Slight floral nature. Some mild tangy, sour character.
I'm really not sure what this is, or what it supposed to be. Either way it's largely forgettable for me."
Brouwerij Smisje,t Smisje Calva Reserva,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,12.00%,bottle,3.55,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,5/2/2008,"11.2oz stubbie bottle that is different from the picture in the BA database. $4.29 for the bottle.
It lists the ABV as 11.0% which leads me to believe that it *could* possibly be the Grande Reserva version, but there is NO mention of this on the label, so I'm runnign with the Reserva.
Dark rust colored pour that is still in the glass - no head or lace to speak of. Consistet with the ABV.
Nose has pleny of sweet alcohol. Replicated up front with sweet alcohol, but the finish s dry and bitter. A certain mustiness to the beer that is not especially attractive. Warmth lingers in the aftertaste. Tastes ""old"", and not in a good way. Some rum notes, with dark sugar. Reminds me of a Jamaican drink. A little light in the mouth.
This didn't do a great deal for me."
Five Seasons North,Whisky Barrel Aged Quinte55ence,,,Quadrupel (Quad),?,bottle,3.33,3.5,4,3,4,3,5/1/2008,"Better known as ""The Answer"", this is the Barrel Aged version of Quinte55ence. Crawford was kind enough to give me a bottle of this (along with the Quinte55ence original and a couple of Cloud 9's). I shared these with the boys at the Brick Store.
Pour is identical to the Quinte55ence - no surprise there, and equally unsurprising is the aroma which gives the smoky notes from the barrel.
I need to put a disclaimer right up front here, I am just not that interested in Barrel aged beers. They really aren't to my liking very much.
Much prefer the Quinte55ence it its original form, as the added liquor character seems to confuse the beer for me. Coupled with the original edginess and Barleywine character of the Quinte55ence, this becomes a bit too much for me to handle.
Certainly still a quality brew, and if you are interested in this ""type"" of creation I am sure you'll be delighted - just not really my cup of tea."
De Struise Brouwers,Struise Mikkeller (Elliot Brew),,,American Double / Imperial IPA,9.00%,bottle,3.63,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4/27/2008,"11.2oz bottle from State Line Liquors. The ratebeer, SM No.12 edition (if that matters).
Rust colored, hazy pour with nice head, and very impressive, sticky lace. Aroma is sweeter than expected, and does not reveal as much hop character as I expected.
Smooth in the mouth, and not too hoppy or edgy at all. Quite a bit of sweetened grapefruit, but also a decent drop of aspirin/herbal content. In that respect, a little reminiscent of a more balanced Masala Mama. Quite sweet in the finish.
Definitely a beer that has been highly influenced by West Coast/American DIPA's, but still maintains a certain character of its own. Not something that I would be really keen to drink much of again, but nevertheless tasty as a one-off."
Genesee Brewing Co.,Dundee Pale Bock Lager,,,Maibock / Helles Bock,6.20%,bottle,3.88,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,4/27/2008,"Purchased as a 12oz single for $0.75 from the bargain trolley/cart at Arbor Place, Douglasville, GA, USA. 
Golden macro-lager colored body underneath a decent head. Head is short-lived but leaves impressive lace. Not bad looking at all.
Aroma is a malty grain, but not very strong, distinguished or especially interesting.
Tastes are simple. Balanced malts with some hop character and some sweetness. A creaminess to the mouthfeel, and also in the actual taste itself. Distinct and satisfying finish and aftertaste - tangy, yet smooth. An undercurrent of white grapes. I wasn't expecting much but this was tastier than I was anticipating and I enjoyed it very much.
Excellent value for money!"
Belhaven Brewery Company Ltd.,Wee Heavy,,,Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy,6.50%,bottle,2.6,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,4/26/2008,"500 mL bottle purchased on a recent jaunt up the East Coast.
Pour reveals an amber colored body, but it lacks the depth of color that I was expecting. Head is also a little thin and fades quickly with only the tiniest wisp of lace. Some large bubbles of carbonation.
Nose has the obvious malts, but lacks much definition.
Tastes are a little confused for me. Yes there is certainly the rich malty notes that one would expect (and there are some nice biscuit malt notes in the aftertaste), but the alcohol seems oddly present and not melded well into the body of the beer. Actually I'd go as far as to say close to being a bit solvent like. The effect is an acidic, sharp finish that seems out of character with the style. It's certainly sweet (which of course is fine and what I was expecting), but again the beer fails to come together completely for me.
Usually one of my favorite styles, and I had high hopes for this beer, but sadly it didn't come together very well for me. I'd try it again, but this didn't really hit the spot for me."

Allagash Brewing Company,Allagash Hugh Malone,,,Belgian IPA,8.50%,bottle,3.93,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,4/20/2008,"Purchased this one back in November 2007 in Greensboro, NC, USA. I had one bottle around Christmas time and decided to pop this one open to see how it had changed. I don't mind my IPA's with a little age on them, and coupled with the Belgian aspect, I felt this would be a good candidate to put a few months on - luckily, I was right.
750 mL corked & caged affair that opens with a big ""pop"". Poured into the Val-Dieu chalice it sits as a rust colored body. The head disappears very quickly to leave no lace, and only the slightest of fine film on the surface of the brew.
Mouthfeel is quite carbonated,bordering on fizzy. The nose reveals simple Belgian character but little of the hops that the style suggests.
The taste too is mainly Belgian candy and yeasts, with only a hint of the hop bitterness in the end. Obviously this may be because of the age on this beer, but I still like it. Finish is dry and simple. A little orange peel in the finish as well.
Refreshing and tasty, and easy beer to drink."

Shared this (along with The Answer), at The Brick Store with Dave & Bob amongst others. 
*Obviously this is still a draught version, but Crawford bottled some of this beer in corked & caged 750's. 
Pour is a dark brown almost black body with very little sustainable head. I thought it was rather porter like it its appearance. 
Very nice nose with plenty of dark fruit and perhaps even a touch of smoke. This beer has Belgian Quad character, but to me it was MUCH more edgy and less smooth. Some American Barleywine character thrown in with the Belgian sugar and yeast notes, to create some serious alcohol and hoppy overtones.
Mouthfeel was still - very, very little carbonation to speak of.
Interesting brew that for me needs some age. I thought it was a tad raw at this stage, and I would love to see this in 12 months time."
Harviestoun Brewery Ltd.,Ola Dubh Special Reserve 30,,,Old Ale,8.00%,cask,3.2,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,4/19/2008,"I got lucky here - long after Dave had taken this off at The Brick Store he handed me a couple of glasses and took me back into the cellar. There we picked up the ""empty"" cask and poured the last couple of pints from it by tipping it up and massaging the last drops of beer from the vessel into the glasses. I thought I had missed this opportunity, but not so. VERY grateful and appreciative. Thanks Dave.
Black pour with a few reddish highlights - not much. Head is not really a factor here, but some bubbly brown foam from the aggression of the pour.
Well, having tried the 16 last weekend and not liking it a great deal, I was worried about this. Again, frankly I didn't care for this much either. Liquor notes and bitterness was too high for my liking, but once AGAIN (as in the 12), I found the smoke and peat notes to be too much, and this was a factor that I did NOT enjoy. I MUCH prefer the standard Engine Oil beers that have not been aged in the Whisky barrels.
Some others that tried it, raved about it. Having failed to be impressed by both the 16 and the 30, I guess that this is just not a beer for me. I wonder if I will ever get around to the 12, and if the experience will be any different?
Delighted to have tried it, but...eeeehhh.... completely undwhelmed. I happen to have the chance to drink the Meantime Scotch Ale the day after, and I thouhgt it was an INFINITELY better product in the similar style/mould.
I say, let Old Ales BE Old Ales, and keep the sweetness and avoid the Barrels."

Like most, I have very little experience with Wheatwines, and the only one I recall from the reccent past being Harpoon/The Bros. Triticus - this seemed very different.
A very still, viscous orange body with no head or lace but some nice alcohol legs in the wine tradition.
Big solvent alcohol in the nose. The taste smooths out a little, but not a great deal.
Has the alcohol edge that you might expect from an American Barleywine, but this is sweeter and certainly significantly less hoppy.
A bit difficult to get down."
Tröegs Brewing Company,Tröegs Rugged Trail Nut Brown Ale,,,English Brown Ale,4.40%,bottle,3.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,4/19/2008,"12oz single. New label compared to the BA database. Very dark brown pour with plenty of head and some lace. Not much light passing through this one.
Obviously a yeasty and malty nose.
Taste reveals much more of the sweet nut character than the nose. Medium body that keeps this in sessionable country. 
Close to a really good sessionable beer (it could be argued that the ABV is still a little high), but it has all the other desirable factors for a session brew.
Finishes smooth and sweet, and stil satisfies.
A solid example of the style and a nice beer. Good job."

Typical golden, hazed orange body, light head with some lace in the Val Dieu Goblet. Fine bubbles, vibrant colors. Looks nice.
Light Belgian candy in the nose with some yeast. Silky in the mouth with light, fine bubbles. Plenty of sweetness in a typical triple fashion, but also with a really distinct hoppy finish. Reminiscent of a Houbblon Chouffe. Plenty of dry, mild sweetened grapefruit in the finish. Tangy.
Interesting - a distinctly hoppy finish. Very tasty. Classy too; an excellent beer."

WOW - classy! Mid-orange pour with a super high, dense, bone-white head.
Nose has a mild grapefruit which is reflected in the taste.
It is isn't until the ending that you get the Brett/Funk/Saison/Farmhouse notes. All melds together to give a deep, satisfying experience in the glass. Some bitterness in the finish but it comes together beautifully to give a memorable beer.
Smooth on the palate, I would characterize this in the mould of a Belgian IPA, but having some Biere de Garde and Saison character too - an interesting beer.
We were sitting around talking about comparisons and obviously Houblon Chouffe and De Ranke XX came to mind. HOWEVER, when we poured a Chouffe to actually DO the comparison, it seemed weak and watery, ESPECIALLY in the nose - frankly it was VERY light sitting against this.
Interesting stuff!"
New Glarus Brewing Company,Raspberry Tart,,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,4.00%,bottle,4.63,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4/18/2008,"Thanks go out to brickstoredave (and Lucy Saunders) for the chance to try this beer - something I've been waiting on for some time.
750 mL with the usual wax-dipped neck presentation.
Having had the Belgian Red (cherry) I thought that I knew what to expect, and this replicated the style of the cherry and did not disappoint. Straight from the outset I enjoyed this MUCH more.
A dark crimson (almost blood like pour) even with a small head. It's raspberries all the way, both in the taste and the nose. Sweet certainly, but balanced. The raspberry taste is REAL, with it feeling a lot like just the raspberry seeds have been pulverized and bottled - the essence of the fruit.
This seems to have a balance, an effervescence and a fresh edge that the cherry lacks. MUCH lighter with some characteristics of a Lindemanns Framboise and a Kasteel Rouge.
I don't think that everyone will enjoy this, but at 4.00% ABV this is RIDICULOUSLY drinkable. The sweetness is tempered, and I enjoyed this much more than the cherry."

12oz bottle. Almost black out with some brown highlights. Some spotty lace but no head to speak of. 
A little alcohol in the nose and some hints of whisky, but it's not big. Nice aroma, it promises much and the nose is the best part of this beer for me.
A malty beer as expected for the style, but for me there is WAY too much peat and smoke. I understand that this beer is from Scotland, but for me this is out of character and style. The Old Ale style needs to much richer and sweeter - this finishes dry.
Frankly, a bit disappointing. Makes me reluctant to go for the others. I didn't care for this a great deal."

Seems like a macro lager in micro clothing. Light, golden color with a disappointing head and lace. Distinct lack of head and lace, and an odd ""plasticy"" type aftertaste for me. Seemed to have a grainy alcoholic, weirdness to it.
Not at all sure that I would be able to distinguish between this and several macro adjunts - rather poor."

Poured into the Val-Dieu chalice. Pour is a very nice, slightly cloudy classic orange body. Head is not very well retained, but is attractive, and very fluffy. Lace was impressive. It loks attractive and inviting.
Some mild pepper in the taste, but also some edgy, solvent like alcohol. Warming on the way down too. The slightly watery texture adds to the solvent nature. Definitely some lemony, acidic and sour notes, and these take away from the sweetness that I would expect for the style. A dry finish.
A bit odd for me - even from one mouthful to another this seems authentic on one hand, and then a little harsh and alcohol laden on the other. A work in progress in my book."
Lagunitas Brewing Company,Saison Style Ale,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,6.00%,on-tap,3.23,2,3,3.5,2.5,3.5,4/11/2008,"On-tap, Taco Mac, Marietta, GA, USA. $4+ for the 16oz pour.
Nothing special to look at - in fact it has the appearance of a macro lager. In that respect it does not reflect the style very well. I'm looking for a big, fluffy head in my Saison's, some nice lace and some cloudiness in the body. Given the style it preports to be, I was disappointed.
Some funk in the nose but not much. Rather than funk being the predominant taste, I get a sweet Belgin fruit blend. It's not unpleasant but it seems too light for the style and it lacks both character and body.
I'm not saying that this isn't a decent beer to drink - it was quite refreshing and somewhat tasty, but it totally lacks any character, depth, body or presence, ESPECIALLLY when you consider the style. Summer quaffer, perhaps to be used in place of a Pils for someone who prefers something a little sweeter and less bitter/hoppy. It's character as a genuine Saison is limited IMO."
Trader Joe's Brewing Company,Trader Joe's Stockyard Oatmeal Stout,,,Oatmeal Stout,5.00%,bottle,3.03,3.5,3,3,3,3,4/11/2008,"Picked this up as a 12oz single from Trader Joe's.
Nice looking pour with a high, mocha colored head, but relatively poor retention and not much lace. Very good dark brown body with some sharp, garnet highlights. When the head has gone the beer takes on the exact appearance of a coke; including the mild streams of carbonation.
Typical for the style, but I detect more lactose notes. In fact, I might even go as far as to ssay that if this were a blind tasting I could have mistaken this for a milk or sweet stout rather than an oatmeal. Alcohol comes through really strong for the style - almost solvent like - and this sits badly with the chocolatey, milkiness of the brew.
Lightish mouthfeel, and finishes with some burned notes, a touch of charcoal and again, a noticeable degree of ethanol.
This was an older bottle, but not old enough to suspect it had turned, but perhaps this would be better fresh. I'd probably give it another chance."

Reddish brown pour, but lacks a real depth of dark color that I might expect from the style. Head and lace are a little disappointing.
Sweet, malty alcohol in the nose.
The alcohol certainly comes through in the taste. Not overpoweringly, but nonetheless present. Obviously plenty of sweetness. Quite light in the mouth for the style - sometimes you can get an deep, full, syrupy mouthfeel but this seems lighter.
One and done here I think, somewhat average beer and example of the style."

Cape Ann Brewing Company,Fisherman's Tea Party,,,American Barleywine,9.00%,on-tap,4.23,4,4,4.5,4,4,4/6/2008,"$5.99 for the 13oz pour at Sunset Grill & Tap, Boston (Allston), MA, USA.
Mid-brown body with plenty of very sticky lace above the minimalist head. Nose gives away a sugary sweet concoction laced with some alcohol and a light hop presence.
I am generally wary of American Barleywines since I think far too many of them have way too much hop presence for their own good. The nose kind of confirmed my fears, but the tastes did NOT come crashing in as I was expecting. The tea seemed to add a sweet subtleness to the beer that was very welcome.
Some herbal notes are inevitiable, and these calm the hops to give more drinkable, less harsh brew than one might expect.
Sweetness (like an English Barleywine) seems to win out for me. Tasty brew that is different and very enjoyable."
Mayflower Brewing Company,Mayflower IPA,,,American IPA,7.00%,on-tap,4.3,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,4/6/2008,"Delighted to have the opportunity to quaff some of this at Sunset Grill & Tap, Boston (Allston), MA, USA. 13oz pour.
Relatively new to the market, Matt has produced a very simple, subtle beer again. I don't know what his intention was, but essentially apart from the rather high ABV, he has produced an English version of the style rather than an American one. More subtlety than in your face - I love it! I WISH more brewers would do this.
Mid-brown pour, not really especially attractive and probably its weakest point.
Hops take a back seat to some biscuit malts, and the beer is mellow rather than abrasive and harsh. Feels light, and drinks WAY below the advertised ABV for me.
Delicious and from a taste point of view this is very ""sessionable"" without being a session beer - I guess ultimately you would pay the price with the ABV. It's a shame that I will probably not get to try many of Mayflower's products, at least not fresh and near the source."
Sixpoint,Bengali Tiger,,,American IPA,6.50%,cask,4.33,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,4/6/2008,"13oz pour at Sunset Grill & Tap, Boston (Allston), MA, USA. Delighted to find a beer on cask.
Orange-bronze, hazed pour with small amounts of carbonation, head and lace (obviously!)
Subtle hop notes make up the nose and the taste. Nothing overpowering here, and this is a welcome change of pace from double-this and triple-that. Certainly some light floral notes, but I get some really strong English hop influence here. I have NO idea which hops are actually used in this beer, but it seems low-key and built for flavor rather than effect - again pleasing.
Tasty brew indeed, and at 6.5% it feels good and goes down easy.
My first Sixpoint offering and if this is the standard then I am going to seek out plenty more. Super stuff."
Terrapin Beer Company,Terrapin Hop Shortage Ale,,,American IPA,6.20%,bottle,3.2,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,4/6/2008,"My second 22 oz bottle of Terrapin's first special offering. Delighted to get this in the larger serving size. 
Excellent clarity on the pour reveals a super, light orange body with a nice light head, and some sticky lace. Looks clean and inviting.
Big, citrus pine in the nose. No holds barred in the aroma, and it begins to make me wonder if this is going to be one of those hop bombs that rips the roof of your mouth off. Luckily it doesn't.
The taste is much sweeter and less abrasive than the nose would suggest. Pretty good balance. A west coast influence from the hop profile, but plenty of tasty, sweet malts balance it out nicely. In fact, in a blind taste I might even put this in a Pils category. Nice sweetness in the finish that is balanced by a hop based aftertaste - sharp and clean.
Although my review above seems quite good, paradoxically this was a tad disappointing. It just didn't do much for me, and given it was a special release, I thought it could have done more."

Pour reveals plenty of head and lace, and a lovely golden, orange clear body. Lace is very good, carbonation is high. Very mild citrus hop nose, which is repeated in the initial taste. After that the beer becomes a simple, dry and clean Pale Ale. Lovely, tasty malts but with a tart edge. Aftertaste comes through with a delicious dry and mild bitterness. It lingers a little.
VERY quenching, and tasty. ABV is attractive to me.
I would imagine that a lot of people will miss the point of this beer, but if you can appreciate a simple, well made beer then this is one you must try - very nice, delighted to have tried it."

Surprisingly I had never seen this beer or this brewer with beers on tap in the USA, so I was delighted and excited to try it. It was served in the brewery's own glassware - an impressive, bowl-like goblet that really looked great! Allowed me to take some lovely, large, satisfying gulps that swirled around inside the mouth. Beer feels bigger than it really is.
Very solid example of the style. Lovely pale yellow color with nice head and some lace. Simple peppery, sweet notes and Belgian candy and yeast. Pretty much exactly what you would expect from the style with the exception of the body that was a little light for my tastes. Drinks under the advertised 8.00% ABV.
I really enjoyed this, especuially the presentation and the taste - good stuff!"
Cambridge Brewing Company,Saison Noire,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,5.80%,on-tap,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,4/5/2008,"On tap, Deep Ellum, Boston, MA, USA.
What a great beer. Poured into a large snifter, the beer comes out almost completely black. Nice full head, lace and general appearance. Looks robust.
I get plenty of licorice and aniseed. Tasty mild funk too (to give a nod to the Saison moniker), but it is muted and light in terms of presence.
Good body, and a beer that feels authentic to me. Malty.
I really enjoyed this very much, and the idea of mixing the darker malt base into this style really pulls off a tasty and intriguing beer. A dark Saison - I like it!"
Harpoon Brewery,Steve Stewart's Firth Of Forth Ale (100 Barrel Series #22),,,Scottish Ale,5.40%,bottle,3.35,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,4/5/2008,"22 oz bottle with the usual 100 Barrel Series label presentation. Poured this one into the 0.5 L Harpoon IPA, reverse flared Stange-like glass.
Pretty standard, deep copper colored pour with a bit of a disappointing head and very little lace. Even some agitation fails to produce much life - carbonation seems a little low. Nice clarity in the body though.
Nose seems pretty neutral. Maybe some caramel notes.
Taste has a simple balance of malts and hops, but lacks a lot of depth. Might be totally my imagination, but there seems to be a little smoky peat in there too. Simple caramel based finish.
I dunno, it seems as though this beer lacks depth. I was hoping for a richer, deeper experience here, and with a sensible ABV I thought that I would like this more. Richness is the thing that is missing for me. It seems like it has potential but just misses the boat. I'd like to see this one get developed a bit more, but I guess this will be one and done and never seen again. Could do better I guess would be my summary."
Richbrau Brewing Company,Belgian-Style White Ale,,,Witbier,5.70%,on-tap,2.95,3,3,3,2.5,3,4/5/2008,"16oz pour $2.38 during Happy Hour.
Cloudy appearance with a very light mouthfeel and taste. A little too light for my tastes, in fact maybe even a little watery. Slightly too simple?
Some Belgian yeast notes come through. Refreshing and drinkable, but lacks body and character. It was a beer that I would call competent. Not bady made, but something that I would imagine a half decent homebrewer could put together. One for the ladies?"

Lovely dark dark brown pour and a nicely formed head. Some lace. 
Good malts (obviously) which are going to be the basis for any decent Alt. I pick up a mild nutty roastiness, and some golden syrup. Slightly too sweet for me, but a pretty good stab at the style - drinkable."
Richbrau Brewing Company,Winter Warmer,,,Winter Warmer,?,cask,4.18,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,4/5/2008,"What a delightful find. A cask beer! Unusual enough in this part of the world, but being in the style of a Winter Warmer makes this a exciting brew to stumble across. Two, 8oz half-pint pours at $1.80 each during Happy Hour.



Great garnet color with a super head and lace. Looks great. Beautiful clarity, very smooth in the mouth. Nutty malts. Highly drinkable, a relatively subtle beer wiithout any kind of Winter Warmer spice that I could pick up, but still very tasty. Impressed."
Allagash Brewing Company,Allagash Odyssey,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,10.30%,bottle,4.55,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4/4/2008,"750 mL corked & caged from Jax in Sandy Springs, Atlanta, GA, USA. I think this was $12.99 for the bottle. The January 2008 bottling.
I was a little wary of this, as I am with the majority of Oak-Aged beers. Often I find the oak tastes simply overwhelming. As a result I opened this with a little trepidation. 
Poured into the Ommegang chaice this sits nicely in the glass with a creamy, dense head (if somewhat small). Not much lace. Lovely dark brown body, almost black. Nose reveals some sweet alcohol, but the oak is muted.
Velvety smooth in the mouth - really creamy. 
Soft, sweet Belgian candy notes with plenty of liquor soaked, dark fruits. Tasty.
A very surprising dry, slightly bitter, alcoholic finish and aftertaste. Very nice, and this is where the hint of oak comes in - to be honest it is (somewhat unusually) very subtle.
As can happen from time to time, I liked this beer more than I thought I would."
Blue & Gray Brewing Co.,Fred Red Ale,,,American Amber / Red Ale,?,on-tap,3.08,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,4/4/2008,"On draught at Bailey's Grille & Pub in Fredericksburg, VA.
Simple Red Ale - no more no less. Not memorable, but at the same time not offensive. Lacked much character, was a little too malty and lacked the dry finish. It was served too cold, but that's a bar problem rather than a beer problem.
Somewhat non-descript first offering from this brewery for me, but not horrible so I will gladly try again."

Updated Review 08/09

22 oz bottle from Hop City, Atlanta, GA, USA. $5.99 (I think) for the bottle. Poured into an oversize wine glass that I picked up in Raleigh, NC a couple of weeks ago.
Pour is a vivid mustard, clouded body that sits underneath"
Foothills Brewing Company,Irish Red Ale,,,Irish Red Ale,4.70%,on-tap,4,4,4,4,4,4,4/3/2008,"On tap, Tyler's Taproom, Durham, NC, USA.
$4.25 for the 16oz ""pint"".
Classic look, with a deep garnet hue and a good half-inch of solid, foamy head. Head disappeared quite quickly, some lace.
Very solid offering from a reliable brewer that consistently hits the spot in terms of styles and drinkable beers. Nice hop/malt balance, but the most important attribute for a Red is the finish. This hit the spot with a characteristic, dry note and left a subtle and pleasing aftertaste. Lots of (partial) session potential I would think, but without knowing the actual ABV I would still be a little wary.
More good beer from the guys in Winston-Salem."
The Lost Abbey,Judgment Day,,,Quadrupel (Quad),10.50%,bottle,4.23,4,4,4.5,4,4,4/2/2008,"Corked & caged, 750 mL bottle with an impressive looking label featuring The Four Horsemen of the Apocolypse - fantasy style. Nice looking artwork and coloring, and the two part label make this look like an impressive beer. I like the text that is written on the rear label - much simplier that a lot of Stone nonsense (for example), but still an interesting message. 5/5 for presentation.
Poured into the Ommegang chalice. Not a great color, again that murky brown Dubbel like appearance that I dislike so much, but it has more carbonation than I was expecting. Thin, creamy and spotty head forms on the surface of the beer, with little or no lace - that's OK, wasn't expecting very much.
An interesting spice-like pepper note cuts across the expected dark fruit and sweetness. This is one of the more edgy quads that I have tasted which takes us into Belgian Strong Dark territory with a distinct peppery quality.
Standard dark fruit base, with large hints of alcohol and a touch of residual bitterness as well - maybe some red-grape skins? The usual plums and raisins are there. The alcohol becomes more pronounced on warming, even leading to a mild burn.
For me the drinkability went down somewhat as the bottle was consumed.
In summary this is an impressive brew that makes me want to get into more Lost Abbey beers. Thanks to Rustydiamond for allowing me to piggyback on a South Bay order."
Brooklyn Brewery,Extra Brune,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,8.50%,on-tap,2.73,3,2.5,2.5,3.5,3,4/1/2008,"On tap at Tyler's Taproom, Durham, NC, USA. Served in a Brooklyn snifter, $6.00.
Flanders Oud Bruin? Not to me. This appeared to be an overly sweet Dubbel. Typical, dirty brown Dubbel body with some floaties. The overwhelming sensation and taste here was sweet, sweet, bubblegum. The bubblegum aroma and taste were extraordinarily strong to the point of being distracting. No hint of any sour notes that one might expect in a more typical example of the (alledged) style. Hubba-Bubba aged??
I dunno, this seems like a bit of an work in progress to me. I'm really not sure what it is trying to be. If it's trying to be an Oud Bruin then it fails; if it is trying to be a Belgian Dubbel then it is too sweet with much too much Belgian sugar influence.
There's quite a lot of Belgian yeast influence, but the bubblegum is way too strong to make me want another one of these."
Ølfabrikken,Ølfabrikken 100 Gram India Pale Ale,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,8.50%,bottle,3.05,3,3.5,3,2.5,3,3/24/2008,"$7.99 bomber at Dukes Package, Marietta, GA, USA.
Murky, light brown pour into the US pint glass. Lack of clarity, and a turbid brown color rather than the orange end of the spectrum. Decent head, but lace fades quickly. Average looking.
Sweetened grapefruit in the nose.
Very sweet. Plenty of unrefined sugar upfront and this does not fade and as a result it tends to leave a sugar deposit in the mouth, on the tongue and the teeth. Some bitterness in the finish (the hops are obviously there), but the whole thing is shrouded in a sweet cloak.
Lacks definition for me - a dull beer, and for someone that generally likes sweet things I found it all a bit taxing. Slick in the mouth - lacks a clean edge.
Pricey as well as average, so not one I'll visit again soon."
Isle of Arran Brewery Company Ltd.,Arran Blonde,,,English Pale Ale,5.00%,bottle,4.23,4.5,4,4,4,5,3/22/2008,"500 mL bottle, Best Before end of Jan 2008 (this is an ocassional problem at Arbor), Arbor Place Beverage, Douglasville, GA, USA. $4.99.
Pour has a lot more orange color (with some cloudiness) than one would expect. Very low carbonation and floral hops, this has the feel of a cask ale. Delicious.
Aftertaste has a little bitterness, but of course it is muted. Plenty of biscuit malts. The light floral notes are the overwhelming experience, and they are super tasty. Organic notes, with some grassy taste too.
Very light; very organic; very floral.
An unusual ale in as much as it reminds me of a cask. Tasty and very drinkable. Certainly won't be to everyones taste, but for me it is super."
Pivovar Podková&#328;,Podkovan Dark,,,Euro Dark Lager,3.80%,bottle,2.83,4,3,2.5,3,3,3/22/2008,"$2.19, 500 mL bottle, Arbor Place Beverage, Douglasville, GA, USA.
Like its lighter brother, this bottle has a higher expectation than the actual beer ultimately delivers.
To be fair the body and look is decent enough with good clarity and a decent head (a little lace) - nose delivers some half-decent malts too and it drinks easily, but it's light on taste and depth.
OK for a summer beer, but lacks any kind character."
Southern Tier Brewing Company,Porter,,,American Porter,5.20%,bottle,3.03,3.5,3,3,3,3,3/22/2008,"12oz bottle as part of the mixed 12 pack - thanks go out to Rob for the chance to try this. Different label to the one in the BA db.
Standard dark brown pour with a small, nicely formed head but not much (if any) lace. Solid if unspectacular look. Some red highlights.
Very standard and solid example of the style. More bitter than the English original, less creamy with a higher hop profile, but simply solid. Mild raost.
A simple, unspectacular brew without much charm but a decent example."
AleSmith Brewing Company,AleSmith Grand Cru Ale,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,10.00%,bottle,4.18,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,3/21/2008,"Thanks go out to Rustydiamond for hooking me up with this via South Bay Drugs - nice piggyback shipment Lance, thanks buddy.
Impressive 750 mL bottle, thick and heavy glass and thick gold foil on the neck. Nice presentation. Bottle lacks the champagne dimpled bottom. No vintage noted on the bottle, but must be fresh (Late '07/Early '08). No cork, no cage, just capped.
Poured into te Ommegang chalice the head is small and lacks much depth, and the body is a light, brownish/red. Little lace. When the light hits the glass in a certain manner it looks REALLY red - literally!
Nose is mainly brown sugar with a touch of alcohol and a touch of Belgian yeast. 
Sweet, mild alcoholic raisins and plums are the main competing tastes. Rich malts follow in the finish and aftertaste with a touch of subtle alcohol. Has a certain maderia sherry quality about it. Obviously the taste improves with a touch of warmth.
Very nice offering in most respects with the only fault in my book being the mouthfeel. I thought it was a tad thin for the style."
Big Sky Brewing Company,Big Sky IPA,,,American IPA,6.20%,bottle,3.1,3,3.5,3,3,3,3/21/2008,"12oz bottle as a single from BA russpowell in a recent trade. Thanks! 318 07 3 on the bottle neck.
Run-of-the-mill American IPA with a hop base that is consistent with the style, slightly unbalanced and mildly puckering. Malt is there but battered by the hops. The head is small and poorly retained. Decent color, more on the brown side rather than the oft orange side of things.
Nose is fairly aggressive with a citrus ine combo.
At the end of the day an OK American IPA, but it's somewhat lost in shuffle. It is possible that my tastebuds may be a bit jaded in this style, but for me this does not make much of an impression."
Brouwerij Westvleteren (Sint-Sixtusabdij van Westvleteren),Trappist Westvleteren Blonde,,,Belgian Pale Ale,5.80%,bottle,4.35,4.5,3,4.5,5,5,3/21/2008,"330 mL bottle. Poured into the Westvleteren chalice.
Amazingly dense, perfectly white head with excellent retention and lace. Golden (and I mean golden), hazed body. 
Creamy smooth in the mouth. A combination of cream and velvet.
Nose is frankly NOT much! A little disappointing.
Classic peppery, mild bitterness in the taste with an alcohol edge way beyond the advertised ABV. Drying finish and VERY clean. Champagne-like character for me.
As Jason noted, this may be the very best session beer in the world. Obviously slightly too high in ABV for a TRUE sessionable beer, BUT it's only slightly above what I would tolerate, and for an experienced drinker in the right frame of mind this could be THE perfect beer for a long night of drinking. In the USA, the availability and price obviously negate that!
In summary, a deliciously drinkable brew IF you can appreciate the subtleties of this beer. I think this one is really for the experienced drinker."
Grand Teton Brewing Co.,Bitch Creek ESB (Extra Special Brown Ale),,,American Brown Ale,6.00%,bottle,3.43,4.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,3/21/2008,"12oz single from russpowell as part of a recent trade.
Pour has excellent color, with a beautiful red clarity and a nice creamy head. Good lace. Looks inviting.
Malty nose, but some extra hop character. It melds quite nicely together. A little sugary-sweet alcohol in there too.
Nice malty base which encourages me, but ultimately the hop bitterness slightly spoils the finish for me. I think this is yet ANOTHER American brewed ESB that has too prominent a hop taste. Bitterness lingers a LONG time in the finish.
The beer is OK, but once again I am disappointed in the style reference."
Sleeman Brewing And Malting,Sleeman Red Ale - Rousse,,,American Amber / Red Ale,5.50%,on-tap,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3/20/2008,"On tap, Taco Mac, Marietta, GA, USA. $4.75 a pint. Taco Mac is advertising this as ""La Russe"", which for now, I am assuming is this beer - seems reasonable, but maybe I'll have to change it later. As usual, TM has a tenous connection with beer knowledge. Served way too cold.
Pint has a nice garnet color, but a small head and not much lace. Has a typical, British, kegged-bitter appearance, which to be brutally frank, is not necessary wonderful.
In reality, I quite liked this beer - it seemed to have an almost sweet and sour quality about it. It was difficult to characterize this, but I am guessing that the malts made uo the sweetness and the hops introduced some bitterness. Certainly a fruity nature to the beer as well. Slightly tart fruit in there (unsweetened raspberries, strawberries ""x""berries etc.)
This was tasty. I'm not totally convinced by it, but I would like to visit it again."
Victory Brewing Company,Donnybrook Stout,,,Irish Dry Stout,3.70%,on-tap,2.48,3,3,2.5,2,2,3/20/2008,"From notes, from a draft offering at The Brick Store, Decatur, GA, USA.
Here's the deal - by all means make a sessionable, simple, low ABV beer (the lack of these type of beer is what I am pretty much constantly lamenting here in the US), BUT that's not an excuse to brew a beer that is frankly thin and bland and lacking taste.
Very poor effort for me all the way around. The mouthfeel is VERY thin, and the taste lacks character - I wasn't expecting much depth, but there was very little taste.
Again, no problem with a sessionable beer (in fact quite the opposite), but this was a poor effort. It takes time to make strides in brewing beers like this to a high level, and this is going to be a job for Victory, and a work in progress."
Privatbrauerei Gaffel Becker & Co.,Gaffel Kölsch,,,Kölsch,4.80%,bottle,3.18,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,3/19/2008,"500 mL bottle from Arbor Place Beverage.
Very light colored (even watery) pour with a light, fluffy head that disappears quickly. Not much lace.
It drinks like a very lightweight Pils. A simple bitterness that fails to really bite. Mouthfeel is simple but does not really evoke any memorable experiences. Lacklustre.
A little too simple, EVEN for the style I feel. When you are brewing/drinking these delicate styles you tend to walk a very fine line between a forgetable beer and a nice example of the style, and this one has a foot in both camps for me."
Red Brick Brewing Company,American Best Bitter,,,English Bitter,?,cask,3.65,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,3/19/2008,"Apparantly (I've never been here before so I am guessing slightly) this is part of the ""Peachtree and 14th"" rotating cask series at TAP, Peachtree Street, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Surprisingly light, golden colored beer that reminded me of a (recently) popular English Golden Ale in terms of its appearance. Low carbonation (as expected) but more thin head and lace than I was expecting.
Nice biscuit malts are present as I would I expect, and these do linger nicely into the aftertaste. Tasty brew with a smooth, drinkable character and I enjoyed this cask offering. It's not very often that I get the chance to grab a pint of cask in Atlanta so this was a real treat. It may have skewed my review a little too, but nevertheless I still enjoyed it.
Two problems for me; It's hop profile is too high for a Bitter, and it was $10 a pint! Bad value, it ought to be CHEAPER than the other 15 bottles and 15 taps in the place."
Genesee Brewing Co.,Dundee India Pale Ale,,,American IPA,6.30%,bottle,3.53,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3/16/2008,"Snagged in the bargain bucket at Arbor Place Beverage, Douglasville, GA, USA as a 12oz single for $0.75. Can't go wrong.
Light copper colored body with a fairly large, but not very dense, creamy head. Some lace. Small bubbles persistently rising from the bottom of the Sweetwater Pils glass.
Surprisingly malty nose with a little hop presence.
Balanced IPA initially, but really shows its American side in the finish and aftertaste. Smooth and tempered up front, but then quite a metallic, grassy bitterness to finish. Lingers too.
Refreshing and sharp, but a little too harsh for my liking."

Like a few other BA's, at first glance I thought this was probably a Czech *Pils*, but after closer inspection that particular word is distinct by its absence from the label -this turns out to be a rather average Euro lager with all its average points.
Golden pour, the body looks good. Decent carbonation and associated head and lace. Mild skunk in the nose, but it drinks innocently enough. Average sweetness, a good ABV for having a few in the hot weather. malty presence and no hop bite to speak of. Saaz presence is certainly missing!
A decent warm eather drinker, but only a couple of notches aove BMC to be honest. Decent value and easy drinking, and as long as your expectations are not too high, you'll be OK."

Well carbonated pour with a big, creamy attractive head. Leaves some pretty good lace. Nice clarity on the brown/red body. Some organic, grassy notes of hops in the nose.
Caramel malt, simple drying finish make up a classic example of the style. Tasty and toasty. Very nice dry finish is apparent which is a great sign for the style. Sharp, satisfying bitterness. This is very tasty.
Very tasty and simple. Moreish."

Simple copper body, nice clarity and a simple, bone-white head. Some lace. Carbonation is medium.
Very simple malts. Biscuit notes and some mild pepper. Slight spice, that almost seems like a corriander note. It's a malt based beer (obviously) but the malts are not large ones. Tempered. Light in the mouth that makes it drinkable, but seems a little thin for the style.
Very good character, with a nice bitter ending. ABV makes it sessionable - price probably doesn't. Good example of a British based ale, but lacks the malty depth of a typical Scottish brew. Tasty."

Nice looking, brownish-red body in keeping with the style. Head is large and smoke colored (yellowish tinge). Head is a bit light and airy so it disappears very quickly. Very little lace.
Aroma is DISTINCTLY NOT smoked, which I suppose is a bit of a disappointment (hence the low score for aroma).
Mouthfeel is a little thin for me.
Mild smoke is the overwhelming taste. Not much Doppelbock flavor, but at the same time the beer seems to taste like I would imagine a smoked Dopplebock would! In that respect I suppose it is ""good"".
Not really my cup of tea, but if you like smoked brews I think this would be an option."
Privatbrauerei Bischoff,Doppelbock,,,Doppelbock,7.50%,bottle,2.7,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,3,3/14/2008,"500 mL screw-top single from Tower, Piedmont, Atlanta, GA, USA. I think it was $3.69.
Amber color that lacks depth. Some impressive head, but this leaves very little lace ultimately. It's more froth than anything else. Some alcohol in the nose, but I don't pick up much else. Some sugary sweetness too.
Strange metallic bitterness accompanies the expected Bock characteristics. The bitter twang lingers on through the finish. Mouthfeel lacks the creamy luxury that you might expect from the style, and it all feels a little aftershave like! Solvent like quality in the aftertaste too, a bit rough.
I've noticed a few new offerings in this range and I went for this as I thought it would be the safest bet; IF it is the best they can offer, then there's not much point in trying very much else - we'll see."

OK, I think that you need to be in the mood for this. Obviously this is a VERY high alcohol brew and with that comes some syrupy body and excessive (relative) sweetness. Having said that, all things considered it drinks OK, and it is tasty.
I am very surprised at the color because it is so golden orange. Not a great deal of head and not much retention (but I wasn't expecting much). Obviously with a Doppelbock I was expectig a darker brew. I was also expecting some banana notes, but this really turned out to be a sweet, Euro lager.
Considering the massive nature of this beer it pulls it off well. This is NOT a brew to be trifled with, not is it a beer that should be judged outside of the parameters that it sits in. Take it for what it is and you'll probably be happy."
Brouwerij De Musketiers,Troubadour Obscura (Mild Stout),,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,8.20%,bottle,3.95,3,4,4,4,4,3/13/2008,"330 mL single from Tower on Piedmont, Atlanta, GA, USA. $3.99 (I think). 
Very interesting in terms of style. Categorized in the BA db as a BSDA, on the label and in the name as a ""Mild Stout"" (whatever THAT is), but IMO it seems to be very close to a Dubbel. I'm increasingly confused becasue I am not a big fan of Dubbels in general, but THIS I quite like.
STILL has that relatively unattractive (to me), dirty brown murky body. Thin film of mocha head on the surface. Little or no lace.
Definitely some light chocolate, stout like notes. Smooth and drinkable. A nice combo of mild alcohol, Dubbel sweetness and a touch of stout bitterness. Tasty."

Poured this bad boy into the Duvel tulip. Golden body with a decent head. The head was not huge, nor did it last a long time or produce much lace, but considering the ABV not that surprising. ABV means I still score it high for look. 
Aroma and taste match very well. Belgian yeast notes, candied sugar, alcohol and spice. A touch of citrus and a sweetness that is really quite high - luckily I love that. Alcohol is superbly balanced. It kicks in and does the job, but is VERY balanced considering the 11%. Very well made brew. Coriander is beautifully balanced and gives a sweet and sour effect to the brew.
A special beer. Hits a number of my sweet spots. It won't be for everyone, but for me this is close to perfect."

Essentially this pours like a RIS. Jet black body, small mocha head and some lace, but not much - in line with the ABV. Looks luxurious.
Yeast and malt dominate the nose.
Taste? ASTONISHING!!! Alcohol is nowhwere to be seen and it's as smooth as HELL! Wave after wave of sweet, malty, alcohol.
I have a feeling that DFH have defined a new style. This is an IMPERIAL brown ale. I am VERY, VERY wary of silly, American nonsense when it comes to ""imperializing"" all sorts of styles, but this is a MASTERPIECE.
Another AMAZING beer from Sam and the boys - they are on the cutting edge. I plan to lay some of this down - I think it could be a delicious developer!

Pisgah Brewing Co.,Pisgah Valdez,,,American Double / Imperial Stout,6.80%,growler,3.45,4,5,3,3,3,3/8/2008,"Thanks to Rustydiamond, via mikesgroove, for the chance to have a crack at this one. 64oz growler. Attractive design on the glass.
Pour shows a great, jet black pour (as expected), but a rather too fizzy a head. Carbonation seems high for the style. Head dies quickly with almost no lace.
Aroma IS exceptional - pure coffee, no more, no less. 
Tastes do not reflect the huge aroma. I guess I was expecting a big gulp of coffee, but instead I got a rather reserved, porter, mildly roasted flavor. The mouthfeel is a little disappointing for the style. In fact, rather thin.
Has to be said, this was pretty uninspiring."

Beautiful, deep chestnut brown pour. Small head with a little lace. Color and clarity are great, and with a bit more head it would have got a perfect appearance score from me.
What I like about this beer is exactly what I thought I would like - its explicit simplicity. Easy drinking malts, a classic mouthfeel and a low key, high quality, subtle taste. Solid malt backbone.

Big frothy head sits atop the burned orange colored body. Carbonation is a little too lively for my liking - seems kind of fizzy. Musty yeast in the nose.
Fruits are all over the place on the initial taste, but these back off quickly to leave a dry and surprisingly balanced beer. Not much sweetness in fact. A mild white pepper bitterness sits against the Belgian candy and yeast, and the overall experience is quite tempered. Carbonation makes in a touch prickly. A slight champagne like dry character about this one.
Nice beer but a couple of things; it fails to really show an identity. Not quite fruity enough, not quite spicy enough, not quite enough alcohol flavor, and as a result it seems to get lost in the shuffle. I also prefer a lighter (Duvel like) pale yellow color in my Belgian Pale's. Not really a big deal, but nonetheless something that I would like to see.
Not bad, but considering the, ""I was not blown away"" factor, too pricey for me to be a regular in the Belgian rotation."

Standard, jet black body with the espreso foam colored head - the color of the head reminds me of the tobacco stained wallcoverings of really old, Snug bars from the 70's. Attractive color. Some lace, but not extensive.
Nose has the usual roasty bitter profile, but follows up with a touch of alcohol. Carbonation seems a little on the high side of the style.
Mellow drinking. The taste does not crash into the tastebds with the bitterness that the nose might lead one to expect. Solvent like alcohol in the finish makes this a bit edgy. Roasted charcoal flavor does not cut in until the aftertaste.
Not bad, but ultimately just another high alcohol, huge RIS for the sake of it."
Mikkeller,Big Worse,,,American Barleywine,12.00%,bottle,3.55,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,3/2/2008,"12.7 fl oz bottle. $9.95 from Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA. Silver foil, corked & caged - nasty synthetic cork has 14/06/11 inked on it.
Deep orange pour into the Ommegang chalice. No head or lace as expected. Pretty typical - high alcohol, sticky mouthfeel, sweet, bitter hop burn in the finish. Like most American style BW's, this is not subtle and is just a little too aggressive for me.
Would obviously cellar well and needs some ime to mellow and have the heat reduced IMO."
Ska Brewing Co.,Decadent Imperial IPA,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,10.00%,bottle,4.68,4.5,4,5,4,5,3/2/2008,"Thanks to russpowell for this opportunity. 650 mL bottle, with a red wax-dipped neck. Nice presentation.
Pour is VERY good looking. GREAT clarity, super head and some lace but with a delicious looking, dark copper colored body - really nice presentation. More sticky lace would have scored it a 5. Frankly at this ABV it's a miracle that it has any at all.
Aroma threatens some sweetness with plenty of alcohol.
Despite the 10%, this drinks well under that number with a very nice mouthfeel - I was half expecting a nasty, syrupy mess. Alcohol is there in the taste but so is a lovely, balanced (as much as you can hope for in a 10% ABV DIPA) malt backbone. Obviously sweet and boozy, but this is one of the better attempts at such a big beer - I really enjoyed it.
Drinkability is a 5 for me, not because this is especially easy to quaff (no more than one 650 mL bottle needs to be consumed in a sitting, and sharing would be nice), but taking into account the style and the ABV I was delighted with the ease of putting it away.
Very nice stuff, tasty, high quality beer."

Nice looking pour with a slightly cloudy appearance, a nice head and a little lace.
Nice example of the stlye that strays over into Belgian Pale territory. Some yeasty notes as well as tastes that have some spice like a tripel. Only thing missing is the alcohol which is pretty much non-existant in this beer.
Finish is dry. Finish is also a little watery.
Decent for the style, but fairly pedestrian."
Boulevard Brewing Co.,Unfiltered Wheat,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,4.60%,bottle,2,2,2,2,2,2,3/1/2008,"Thanks go out to Vancer as part of CEO/OLD Farts BIF.
12oz single in the typical Boulevard stubbie bottle. Hazy orange body with a distinct honey/orange hue. Large initial head with some serious fizzy carbonation. No lace and the head is gone within a couple of minutes. Looks a bit lifeless in the glass. 
Very bland without much taste at ALL. Perhaps a slight, dilutd citrus angle. In fact, the word ""diluted"" seems to be appropriate to me. Watery mouthfeel.
Sorry, but not much to get me excited here. A limp and lacklustre beer that misses on all fronts. A wheat beer for me needs some life to sit against the (relatively) subtle tastes, and this one fails across the board.
A beer that I would imagine would be better fresher and n draft - perhaps I'll never know!"
Green's Gluten Free Beers,Green's Discovery,,,English Strong Ale,6.00%,bottle,3.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3/1/2008,"Thanks go out to Silentsabre for the chance to try this one. 500 mL bottle, different to the picture in the BA db (maybe that is an English version and this is the American version?).
Product of Belgium? An English Strong Ale? No Barley? I wonder...
Cloudy amber pour with a small amount of carbonation. Head is frothy and light but has a nice formation. Broken lace forms on the glass.
Aroma is dent with a touch of alcohol and some malty fruit.
Tastes a bit wine like. Alcohol seems MUCH higher than the 6% would suggest. The more I taste, the more cider/wine tastes come through. Slightly acidic and rather refreshing actually. Some fruit in the finish. Chilled well, this is reminiscent of a simple fruit beer. Not sure I can identify the specific tastes, but it is drinkable. Has a pleasing dry finish too that kicks in a little extra bitterness.
I guess that I really didn't know what to expect at all, but to be honest this really wasn't bad. I know that some people don't even consider this to be beer, but I think it is half decent. To be quite frank, I think I could drink a few of these!

Pours with a really rather alarming amount of carbonation - very fizzy. Obviously this dies very quickly to settle into the non-carbonated, still beer that I was expecting, but I was shocked by the initial pour. Strange. Settles to give a dark orange (verging on red) body with some spotty lace only on the surface.
Aroma is not complicated and seems to be made up of an earthy alcohol and not much else.
Tastes are mixed. As expected there is an enormous sweetness and some warming alcohol in the finish, but the effect that the whisky has had is a little odd. It seems to have imparted a smoked, earthy, peat like taste to the beer which seems a bit disjointed. 
Probably my least favorite of the Lees Harvest Cask series."
Wernesgrüner Brauerei AG,Wernesgruner,,,German Pilsener,4.90%,bottle,1.83,2,2,1.5,2.5,2,3/1/2008,"Not sure how old this bottle is, but with no dates on the bottle put there by the brewer I feel justified in reviewing it. Picked up as a 12oz single from Jax in Sandy Springs.
Odd, wit colored pour but exhibits some clarity. Not much carbonation but it does create a decent head in the 20oz Imperial pint glass.
Macro lager attributes all over the place with the exception being a sharpish, hop bite in the finish. No aroma and a strange, malty bitterness associated with each mouthful
Mediocre at the VERY best, I bet this is light years better at source."

Pour is very pale, even anticipating the style. Nice looking head initially, but of course it fades in seconds to virtually nothing and there is no lace.
Aroma yields a little cooked vegetables but not much else.
Clean until the finish which comes through with a little hop bitterness - almost like a badly made Saaz pils. Aftertaste has a metallic bitterness that lingers. To its advantage it feels clean upfront.
Pretty much exactly what you would expect - it's one and done for this beer."

Very attractive golden, orange hue that had good clarity, nice carbonation and a decent white head and some good lace. A close look at the body seems to reveal a little oily, viscous nature - more of that later.
Taste is relatively crisp and refreshing, but ends with a surprisingly large alcohol taste. Not sure if it was actually the alcohol, or whether it was just a ""taste"" of alcohol. The mouthfeel is a bit viscous, and together these factors seems to make this drink above it's published ABV. The aftertaste is also a bit of an odd, yeasty, malty mess that ligers a bit.
To be honest, not a bad crack at the style. One of the better efforts by a brewery that struggles to impress."
the Nils Oscar Company,Nils Oscar Barley Wine,,,English Barleywine,9.50%,bottle,4.03,4.5,4,4,4,4,2/27/2008,"11.2 fl oz. bottle, $5.99 from Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Into the Ommegang Chalice the body is a crystal clear bright orange. Attractive color. Thin film of head on the surface but virtually no lace.
Not much hop presence until the swallow, which reveals some alcohol. Plenty of residual sweetness as you would expect from the style. Some honey.
Definitely English in the BW category and a nice, simple one at that. Pretty light in the mouth, alcohol well hidden and easy drinking. I suspect that this beer will be misunderstood in the US where most BW drinkers are looking for huge hos in the American BW style. Ho hum."
Carolina Beer Company,Cottonwood Endo India Pale Ale,,,American IPA,5.90%,bottle,3.23,3.5,3,3,4,3.5,2/26/2008,"Purchased as a 12oz single from Total Wine on a recent visit to Charlotte, NC, USA.
Darker pour than I was expecting for the style with a nice, creamy looking head and some minimal lace. Body is a little murky for my liking, lacking clarity. Mild carbonation.
Soapy element to the nose. Mild caramel backbone with some grassy, organic like hops also detectable. A little bitterness in the finish, but not a great deal. Smooth in the mouth, possibly the best feature of this beer. Some lingering bitterness in the aftertaste. A bit powdery, not especially clean in the taste - maybe an older bottle.
Middle of the road, with moderate to good drinkability but nothing to report. Slightly above average offering from a brewer that I have come to expect very little from."
Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),LongShot Weizenbock,,,Weizenbock,7.20%,bottle,3.15,3,3,3,3.5,3.5,2/24/2008,"12oz single from the Grape and Weizenbock mixed pack in 2008.
Turbid brown, somewhat unattractive, but fairly standard look for the style. Nice, high head with good density. Some lace. Chocolate milk colored body. Decent carbonation.
Usually the nose and the taste match fairly well on Weizenbock's (one of my favorite styles), but this one has banana, (slight) clove and sweetness in the taste but more emphasis on the alcohol in the nose.
Sweetness is a little too much EVEN for my tastes, and I think it pushes this slightly to the edge of the style. Apart from that it has all the characteristics of a good Weizenbock but I think it needs some refinement. Nearly there."
Nøgne Ø - Det Kompromissløse Bryggeri A/S,Saison,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,6.50%,bottle,4.78,4.5,4.5,5,4,5,2/24/2008,"$5.99 from Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA. The 1 Pt 0.9 fl oz bottle has the classy, usual Nogne label.
Very interesting and enjoyable beer. Poured into the Dogfish Head palm glass. Slightly cloudy golden yellow with a bubbly, soap like head an some great lace. Looks super.
Very mild funk in the nose with some alcohol. As it warms more funk comes on.
Very mild tatrness, very mild alcohol and a slight hop bite add to the taste sensation. Slightly oily, slick mouthfeel with a little pils like, Saaz hop bite toward the end. In ALL respects this reminds me of a diluted Imperial Pils (Sam Adams or a DFH Golden Era/Golden Shower). Don't get me wrong, it's a lot lighter than those beers, but it is a very interesting. Very, very mild white pepper.
The mouthfeel IS a bit unusual for the stlye, but for me it works! Slightly slick, slightly Pils like, slightly delicious!
I like this a LOT - all kinds of interesting angles on a Saison which treads a fine along along the edge of the style, but it works VERY well. Very tasty and subtle too. I think this could be a really nice crossover beer. ABV compliments the whole package.
This is one of the best beers I have tried in quite some time."
Brouwerij der St. Benedictusabdij de Achelse,Achel Trappist Extra,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,9.50%,bottle,4.03,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,2/23/2008,"Poured from a bottle that looks like this;
http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/922/40681
but reliable information suggests that these two beers are the same offering just packaged in different ways for different markets - change request for the BA db has been submitted.
$14.99 from Green's on Ponce, Atlata, GA, USA.
Poured into the Ommegang chalice the initial pour is somewhat fizzy and not in a good way - rather soda-like. Highly carbonated with a large, frothy head but the head doesn't have much density - very light and fades pretty quickly. Mid-brown body.
Nose has a lot of alcohol soaked fruit. Lots of brown sugar in the nose - very sweet. Touch of Belgian yeast.
This beer drips alcohol and lives all the way up to its 9.5% tag. Surprisingly still quite fruity and plenty of Belgian candy sugar, but mild burning alcohol on the tongue and in the throat and chest are the enduring memories.
This seems really hot at the moment, and it is surprising for a Belgian AND the style IMO. Best before 09/09 I would be tempted to let this go all the way up to that date and perhaps beyond."

Beautiful looking beer when poured correctly and into the correct glassware. The color is a deep red garnet color with a great clarity, a lovely billowing head and some decent lace. VERY nice color, and I love the clarity.
Interesting because I think this seems to straddle the Enlish/American styles of BW. A sticky, syrup like consistency but the sweetness holds off until the aftertaste for me. However, if you spill this you'll see how sugar there is in this brew! A bit more hop bitterness than I was expecting. Alcohol, while certainly present is not near the 11.00%
A good candidate for the cellar I would think.
One in a sitting is enough for me."
Breckenridge Brewery,Agave Wheat,,,Herbed / Spiced Beer,4.20%,on-tap,2.05,2,2,2,2.5,2,2/22/2008,"On tap at Taco Mac, Marietta, GA, USA. $5.30 for the dubious pleasure of this beer. Just reached GA in the last few days.
Butter colored beer that literally looks like melted butter! ""Unfiltered"" doesn't do this beer justice. It reminds me of the Widmer Hefe. Not very appetizing to look at. Minor film of fine bubbles as the head fades, and minor lace too.
Thinnish mouthfeel and very little taste to speak of at all. Some light tartness but really very little.A little grain character but the beer is largely devoid of any character or taste. Agave? What? Where? Anyway...
Nothing to it, a very disappointing offering. Wrong time of year perhaps?"
Southern Tier Brewing Company,Choklat,,,American Double / Imperial Stout,11.00%,bottle,3.7,3.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,2/22/2008,"22 oz bottle. Many, many thanks to mikesgroove for this gift well ahead of Southern Tier making it to GA.
Opening the bottle (even before pouring) reveals a very strong chocolate aroma. It has a cocoa, drinking chocolate, dryish element to it. Small head, with some lace but not much.
Color is a deep, deep dark brown, but with plenty of red highlights as the light catches the beer. Average mouthfeel with a bitter and slightly acidic finish. A coffee like ending.
Interesting and plenty of chocolate taste, but it finishes much more coffee based than I was expecting - a bit surprising."
Coors Brewing Company,Rising Moon Spring Ale,,,American Amber / Red Ale,5.40%,on-tap,2.5,3.5,2,2.5,2,3,2/21/2008,"BA Review #1400 - not a classic! 
Looks like this got to ATL in the last few days. I've seen a few six packs around in the last couple of days, and I tasted this as a 16oz pour at Taco Mac, East-West Connector, Austell, Atlanta, GA, USA. Charged me $3.98 for the pint. Served with an orange slice...mmmm!!!
I like the packaging - fresh, green look to the label, immediately distinguishable as a Blue Moon/Coors product. Label gives it an extra 0.5 points on the ""appearance"" score.
Typical macro pour, with slightly better lace and head than expected. Still very macro looking with the golden yellow body, great clarity and lively carbonation.
Largely devoid of aroma and taste. Has a slightly citrus note, which to me is more grapefruit than lime like, but to be honest when it is this close to water it hardly matters.
On the plus side quite crisp and refreshing, but strictly from a ""good on a very hot day"" angle.
I dunno - a missed opportunity that could be better but ultimately disappoints. Another token gesture from the big boys, such as a shame they don't REALLY go fo it with TASTE!"

Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),LongShot Grape Pale Ale,,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,5.40%,bottle,3.38,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,2/18/2008,"12oz bottle as part of the Longshot mixed sixer, $7.99 at The Wine Shop, Johnson Ferry Road, Marietta, GA, USA. Notched July 2008.
Poured into the Sam Adams glass the beer has great clarity and initially a light, frothy head. The head fades quickly to leave some scant lace. Very bright orange color makes this look pretty good in the glass.
Aroma is a solvent like alcohol as are the initial tastes. Some fruity character, but not distinguishable as grape to me. I'm not sure if that's the grape element, but whatever it is it creates an odd, solvent alcohol taste. The beer is not overtly alcoholic, but it seems to have an odd, drying, fume type character. Weird. No grape taste as such for me. 
It's odd, but the grape element seems to create an alcohol taste (wine like I suppose).
Refreshing and quite tasty, it's OK, but I don't think I would bother again. A bit odd."
"Bell's Brewery, Inc.",Bell's Hopslam Ale,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,10.00%,bottle,4.23,4,4,4.5,4,4,2/17/2008,"Thanks to brickstoredave (via Robert AKA Georgiabeer) for the opportunity to crack one of these on a quiet Friday afternoon at The Brick Store, Decatur, GA, USA.
12 oz single. Pour is a fairly typical, mid-orange affair with a surprisingly good head and lace for the (apparently) large ABV (more of that later). Typically cloudy appearance for the style.
Nose conjures up a west coast assault on the taste buds, and we're not disappointed when it comes to the taste. The hops ARE massive, but somehow it seems less aggressive than many, similar west coast beasts. It's not like the malts shine through to help much, but perhaps Bell's have a secret ""balancing"" ingredient that they add. The alcohol is nowhere to be seen, I would have NEVER put this at 9.3%!
Interesting beer from two angles for me - firstly the apparent balance that is achieved, and secondly the hidden alcohol. Also, although the balance is there, it still manages to wreck the taste buds for beers later.
Tasty and enigmatic."
Abita Brewing Co.,Pecan Harvest Ale,,,American Brown Ale,5.00%,bottle,1.95,2,2,2,1.5,2,2/16/2008,"12oz stubbie bottle as part of a six pack.
Clear orange lucozade color with some decent carbonation but it doesn't translate into much head or lace. Only an aggressive pour leads to any bubbles.
Grainy, non-descript nose. Soapy taste is all I rally get, and certainly not nuts. Mild bitterness which is (perhaps) hop based, but it's nothing to speak of.
VERY, very thin in the mouth. Watery.
One and done here, another very mediocre offering from Abita. I really don't get why some people think this brewer makes really good beer - to me, all their stuff is pretty ordinary at best."

Pale orange pour with some head and lace but both fade very quickly. Slightly sweet, with a mild bitterness in the finish, but this is bland in the extreme.
Lacks much other taste apart from a simple, metallic bitterness.
Could pass as decent homebrew, but not much else."
Left Hand Brewing Company,Left Hand Rye Bock Lager,,,Doppelbock,7.60%,bottle,4.48,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,2/16/2008,"750 mL corked & caged. The Wine Shop, Johnson Ferry Road, Marietta, GA, USA. 2007 (bottle conditioned) vintage.
Took a long time to remove the cage, and when I finally did, this one had a lot of carbonation.
Poured into the 20oz pint glass. Plenty of large ivory, bubbly head, but not a huge amount of lace. Very nice reddish brown hue.
Very malty nose with some alcohol; very nice, reminiscent of the best, alcohol ridden doppelbocks.
The initial tastes are quite sweet and with some alcohol taste, but no burn. Very smooth and the fine carbonation gives a silkiness to the mouthfeel. A little rye comes through, but not much. Alcohol continues to threaten, but it's funny - it's a ""taste"" rather than a presence - good stuff.
In summary, a pretty interesting balance of rye character and doppelbock character. An interesting combo that I thought might be difficult to pull off by it worked quite well. Tasty."
The Lost Abbey,The Angel's Share - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,,,American Strong Ale,12.00%,bottle,4,4,4,4,5,3.5,2/16/2008,"750 mL corked & caged affair, many thanks to Lance for the opportunity to share this one. Got together with a few beer lovers at the Brick Store on a Friday afternoon.
Pour is essentially black with a nice mocha head. Has a RIS appearance, but the head is not well retained. Rich looking body.
Aroma is certainly attractive, with a mild bourbon type smell that again offers a rich character.
Taste is largely a smooth, light whisky from the oak but frankly not much else. I'm not a massive fan of oak, but it IS tasty as long as it is in small doses. I had about 8oz of the this beer and I wouldn't want to drink much more in any one sitting. The alcohol was pretty much well hidden, and the hit for me was the mouthfeel - just about as rich as a beer can be with out being a stout. Plenty of silkiness in the mouth, and very smooth.
The problem with oaked beers is that the taste can be overwhelmed by the oak and this, whilst still under control, offered little fo r me outside of the liquor presence. Not really reminiscent of a strong ale, if you like oak you'll probably LOVE this big, smooth beer. For me it's strictly a one-off tasting."
Three Floyds Brewing Co. / Brewery & Pub,Black Sun Stout,,,Irish Dry Stout,5.30%,bottle,3.25,4.5,3,3.5,2.5,3,2/16/2008,"Thanks go out to Brian for sharing this at The Brick Store on a recent Friday afternoon. 22oz bomber. Several of us tried the contents with mixed reviews.
Great looking pour which offered much temptation. Jet black body with a decent milk chocolate colored head. Looks good.
Tastes are very typical for the style, and to be honest I thought it hit all the spots pretty well. The only problem we had was that this was a year old bottle. The effect of the aging seemed to see it taper-off quite badly in the finish, leading to a watery ending with no presence. There were some signs of oxidation too.
Mild roastiness, very little alcohol and a few, dry, Baker's (cooking) chocolate notes.
I enjoyed this, but I would have been happier with a fresher bottle - one to re-vsit in the future hopefully."
Steamworks Brewing Co.,Conductor Imperial India Pale Ale,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,8.50%,bottle,3.83,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,2/15/2008,"22oz bomber, thanks to russpowell for the chance to savor this one.
Dark orange body with some clarity but chill haze makes an appearance. Nice sticky lace above the small film of head.
Fairly standard for the style with plenty of big, sweetened grapefruit notes all over the aroma and the taste. It is tasty, and I did enjoy it, but frankly it's another beer in the same mould as many others of the big American IPA breed. I think this may be catching me at a bad moment, as I have had my fill of these beers lately.
Decent beer with the alcohol well hidden, but it lacks any presence for me."

Dark, dark brown body with very little head and no lace. A few reddish brown highlights near the bottom of the glass. A bit flat in the glass, not much life.
A nice, rich alcohol in the nose. A little prickly carbonation that takes away from the smoothness of the body.
A little mild roastiness, but not a great deal - somewhat thin. Some mild smoke. A little sweet chocolate but not much.
The overwhelming feel of this beer is somewhat flat. It is marked on the bottle as Best when consumed on 11/21/07 so it's a bit late, but I doubt that this would/should change that much in that time."

Light amber, solid head and thinnish sticky lace. Slight chill haze and cloudy nature.
Simple balance, sweetish malts, easy drinking and well put together. Mild tang (citrus hops) in the finish, but fairly small and light. Soft mouthfeel.
Very little to report here other than a well made, simple APA that turns no heads but is still a nice example. Everyday drinking and close to sessionable."
The Duck-Rabbit Craft Brewery,Duck-Rabbit Baltic Porter,,,Baltic Porter,9.00%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,2/13/2008,"12oz bottle from a recent trip to Greensboro, NC, USA.
Pour is a classic, simple black body with a typical small, mocha colored head. Looks more like a RIS than anything else.
Some roasty alcohol in the nose.
Obviously lots of roasted notes, but to be honest it is really quite sweet. The sweetness is the distinguishing factor that pulls it into the Porter category rather than the Stout.
Mouthfeel is typically creamy. Mild alcohol burn in the finish, but despite that it drinks well below the 9.00%."
Full Sail Brewery & Tasting Room & Pub,Wreck The Halls,,,American IPA,6.50%,bottle,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,2/10/2008,"Big thanks go out to russpowell for the chance to sample this one. 22 oz bomber, red label that is very different to the one in the picture in the BA db (perhaps it changes annually?).
Pour is a dark, cloudy orange with a nice, noisy, creamy, dense head. Lace is apparent, but not to the extent that the head leads one to believe. Head fades quickly.
Nice, mild orange peel nose with some mild sinus clearing hops.
Medicinal like bitterness meets the tongue at first, and then slips into that aspirin aftertaste. Letting it linger in the mouth produces more bitterness. Dry ending with some metallic character and some unsweetened grapefruit.
Quite a bitter brew, in fact one of the bitterest I have had in sometime, with a good dose of malts that sustain it, but are missing in action in terms of taste.
Interesting beer, alcohol is well hidden, and the package just about comes together. I think I would visit this again, I'd certainly like to try it on draught, and as long as it was in small amounts I think I could grow to enjoy it."

Oh dear. Insipid pour reveals a worryingly pale, cloudy yellow body. Small head leaves quickly and the lace is non-existent. Aroma is a strong Peach one.
Mouthefeel is pretty thin, and the taste is, well, of nothing! ""Watery"" is the only real adjective. Virtually tasteless.
I quite like a decent fruit beer, so that's not my problem, but this was terrible. Mainly water as far as I could tell. Is this macro hell?"
The Matt Brewing Company,Saranac Scotch Ale,,,Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy,5.40%,bottle,2.45,3,3,2,3,2.5,2/10/2008,"12oz single from Mac's Midtown, Atlanta, GA, USA. Part of the $7.99 mixed sixer.
I learned to enjoy Saranac beers as a simple, easy to drink and decent value brews with some good variety. As such, I was looking forward to this. Unfortunately it turned out to be one of their weakest offerings IMO.
Pour is a standard amber look. Head is gone quiclkly without much lace - looks a little lifeless.
Strange smokey smell and taste. This was all a little odd. The smoke taste (with its associated bitterness) overwhelmed what should have been a sweet, malty experience to be in style.
Seems like an odd beer, and very out of style."
Brouwerij De Smedt / Brouwerij Affligem,Affligem Dubbel,,,Dubbel,7.00%,bottle,3.58,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,2/9/2008,"$7.99 from Merchant Package, Johnson Ferry Road, Marietta, GA, USA. 11/03 on the cork from the corked & caged, 750 mL bottle.
As usual that ugly, dirty brown murky pour - GOD I HATE the way Dubbel's look. Fine carbonation on the surface of the beer - a little prickly in the mouth, lace is thin.
Yeasty taste with some acidic qualities. In fact the acidic nature of the beer shines through. A little thin in the mouth, but it's standard.
Better drinkability than I expected. Dubbels just don't do it for me, BUT this is OK and a VERY good example of the style."
Founders Brewing Company,Founders Harvest Ale,,,American IPA,6.50%,bottle,4.03,3.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,2/9/2008,"Pretty sure that this came from Vancer as part of CEO/Old Farts BIF. Thanks man!
12oz stubbie bottle in the typical Founder's style. Advertised as 7% on the label rather than the 6.1% in the BA db.
Lots of sediment in the bottom of the bottle. Pour is a cloudy, deep orange with a large, bubbly head. Lace in minimal but there is some there.
Really grassy, organic nose (as expected from the wet hopping). Hop based brew which sort of belies the APA style, this is more like an English IPA to me. Nice, mild bitterness that is well balanced and supported by the malts. Even quite sweet in the finish with a mild tang - delicious.
Tasty and refreshing - a nice combo.
Easy drinking, everyday beer, but a little too high on the ABV% to be truly sessionable. Nice stuff."
Surly Brewing Company,Furious,,,American IPA,6.20%,can,4.13,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,2/8/2008,"Thanks go out to Mikegroove for this unexpected bonus in a recent package. 1 pint can.
Slightly murky, darkish orange pour with a VERY impressive head and some of the best lace I have seen in ages - amazingly thick and sticky.
Nice hoppy nose.
The taste invokes some serious dry bitterness from the hops. The malts that are advertised on the can are frankly not particularly apparent. Lingering bitterness. Plenty of citrus pine, but it slightly lacks the fresh, edgy nature of some similar, west coast hop bombs. Metallic nature as well.
This looks good, and it is very tasty, but it is pretty harsh and lacks the clean edge of some hop bombs of a similar ilk. High quality brew and a nice treat, but I don't think I could make this a regular in the rotation."
Harpoon Brewery,UFO Raspberry Hefeweizen,,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,5.10%,bottle,2.78,3.5,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,2/7/2008,"12oz single from Mac's Midtown, Atlanta, GA, USA. Part of a mixed $7.99 sixer.
I hated the regular UFO (thought it was AWFUL on draft and in the bottle), so I was worried about this. Poured into the Sweetwater Pilsner glass it has a pretty good head but not much lace. Slightly cloudy with a decent golden color.
Acidic fruit aroma, but it was not really distinguishable as raspberry. The taste is similar, but with more raspberry content. Unfortunately it is watery to me. The diluted effect seems to make the raspberry seems artificial.
Despite all of that it would be a thirst quencher on a hot day - unfortunately it's February.
I dunno - basically pretty much as I expected. Low expectations just about met."
Rogue Brewery (Brewer's on the Bay),Glen Ale ( JLS Release #27),,,American Strong Ale,7.80%,on-tap,4,4,4,4,4,4,2/5/2008,"On tap at Charlie Mopps, Sandy Springs, Atlanta, GA, USA. $5.35 for the 16 oz pour.
Despite the reputation of Charlie Mopps amongst some, they are still serving their beer in frozen glasses, and you can still barely breathe for the smoke in there....anyway, back to the beer.
Simple looking amber our with a nice head, good retention and some sticky, ivory colored lace. A nice looking pint.
Simple malt and bitter balance with (for Rogue) a sensible amount of malt backing up the hops. I though it was smooth and the alcohol onlu JUST shone through. I was a little concerned about this, because when I saw the words ""Strong Ale"" with Rogue attached, I was expecting something a little over the top. This was a more balanced beer than many others they produce.
Tasty, one was enough, but enjoyable."
"Carlton & United Breweries, Ltd.",Fosters Special Bitter,,,American Adjunct Lager,5.50%,can,3.38,4,2.5,3.5,3,4,2/3/2008,"Oil Can as a single from The Wine Shop, Johnson Ferry Road, Marietta, GA, USA.
Amber body with some decent carbonation, small head and some pretty good lace. Good clarity, this is not a bad looking beer at all.
Nose is a bit worrying - has that corn/vegetal macro air about it, but the taste is better. A malty bitterness. Light in the mouth (perhaps thin), but finishes kind of creamy. Finish also produces a metallic bitterness that lingers a little.
I was not very excited about this, expecting little, but to be honest it did better than I thought. Not exactly a classic, but to be honest I found it to be drinkable and not completely without charm. If the ABV really is 2.5%, then I see that as another plus. Actually, in the final analysis, I quite like this!"
Great Lakes Brewing Company,Great Lakes Commodore Perry IPA,,,English India Pale Ale (IPA),7.50%,bottle,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,2/3/2008,"12oz single.
Very, very light, golden yellow pour with soapy film of a head. The color is really unusual. Minimal lace.
Mild citrus hops in the nose. Some sweetness as well.
Sweetened grapefruit makes up the sharp hop profile. Balanced quite well. Quite a bit of sugary sweetness rather than a malt experience. Very simple beer, but tasty to boot. I'd prefer a lower ABV to make it a bit more sessionable, but having said that, the beer does not show the alcohol very much.
Good stuff if you are looking for an American IPA, but I still prefer the ramped DOWN simplicity of the English version."
J.W. Lees & Co (Brewers) Ltd,J.W. Lees Harvest Ale (Calvados Cask),,,English Barleywine,11.50%,bottle,4.83,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,2/3/2008,"$6.49 from Merchant Package Store, Johnson Ferry Road, Atlanta, GA, USA. 50 cents more expensive than most of Atlanta.
9.3 oz bottle, 2004 Vintage.
Mill-pond still on the pour. Dark orange body with a thin ring of lace around the edge of the glass.
Exceptionally sweet (there's no denying that) but it's in line with the style and fits perfectly with the calvados character. Having said that, the apple presence is VERY slight, and it really only imparts a slight tartness to the beer. Without knowing there was calvados present I would have never guessed it. In fact, the acidity is almost like a tannic, bittering grape skin effect.
Warming alcohol in the finish, but absolutely perfectly balanced. The finish also reveals a little more of the fruit, but its still pretty light. 
Considering its 11.5% this is off-the-charts drinkable. Amazingly quaffable and tasty beyond belief.
Not everyone will get this, but it is a perfect English BW, and in that respect it is difficult to fault."
Spanish Peaks Brewing Co.,Winter Cheer Ale,,,American Amber / Red Ale,6.30%,bottle,3.98,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,2/3/2008,"A 12oz single as part of the $7.99 mixed pack at Mac's Midtown, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour is an encouraging, crystal clear, deep brown color. Nice head and lace. Very malty nose and initial tastes, but these give way to a bitter hop finish.
The initial character was a little spice, with some sweet malts, but as the beer warms and toward the finish the beer took on much more of the advertised, Amber/Red character.
I had fairly low expectations here but in the end I was very happy with the beer. Tasty and balanced I thought."
Wells & Young's Ltd,Wells Bombardier (English Premium Bitter),,,Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB),5.20%,on-tap,4.45,4.5,4,4.5,4,5,2/2/2008,"I've been enjoying this over the course of the last few months at The Brick Store, Decatur, GA, USA. 
Great clarity on the pour to leave a mahogany colored body and plenty of ivory colored head and lace. Looks super.
Very typical of the genre, with it's biscuit based malts supporting the very mild bitterness. This has traveled better than many others of the style, and I feel that this is a good example for Americans to sample a simple, moreish, English Bitter. Better on cask (what isn't?), but for now this will do the job.
It may be that I am being a little too enthusiastic about Bombardier, just because it is so difficult to get this type of brew on a regular basis in the US. I miss it terribly and perhaps I am looking through rose-tinted spectacles a bit, but I think this is a lovely brew.
""Sessionable"" (without being a session beer) and delicious, I am delighted to have access to this beer here."
Fiddler's Green Brewing Company,Fiddler's Green India Pale Ale,,,English India Pale Ale (IPA),?,bottle,2.83,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,3,2/1/2008,"As a single from Total Wine in Charleston, SC, USA. 12oz bottle.
Pour is a very, very light orange hue that quite frankly looks a bit watery. Head goes quickly to leave a soapy film and some decent lace.
Some organic, grass based hops in the nose. Floral above everything else.
Taste is really quite bitter, and not in a good way. Sharply acid based and finishes with a orange rind acidity that sits poorly with me. A bit weak in the mouth. Leaves a dry sensation.
Some soapy bitterness in the finish too. Very average beer in my book."
Saint Louis Brewery / Schlafly Tap Room,Schlafly Dry-Hopped American Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),5.90%,bottle,3.75,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,1/31/2008,"Thanks go out to Vancer as part of Old Farts/CEO BIF. 12 oz single.
Pour is a bright orange color, but with plenty of murkiness. Better looking from a distance rather than up close. Nice head with some retention and a good bit of sticky lace.
Great hop aroma - very strong and clean. Hope punch is not as big as the nose would suggest. edgy and clean, some soapiness and nice grapefruit/marmalade finish. Refreshing.
Nice brew, better than I was expecting, and probably would be even better nearer the source and fresher.
Tasty."
Left Hand Brewing Company,Deep Cover Brown Ale,,,English Brown Ale,4.30%,bottle,2.83,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,3,1/30/2008,"12oz bottle as a single from my recent trip to NC/SC - probably from Total Wine.
Pour is a dark orange and lacks the brown clarity that I look for in a Brown Ale - a bit murky for my liking.
Head is short lived and lace is pretty much absent. A little flat. Nutty nose with high caramel content.
Nuts re-appear in the taste. Average malt taste and the mouthfeel is rather thin.
Unimpressive, somewhat weak all the way around I thought."

Mid-orange pour with a high, light (large bubbles) head. Some broken lace, and the head stays on as a film. Sinus clearing hop aroma that increases with temperature.
Mouthfeel is a little thin, but it IS a clean beer. Quite refreshing if a little light. Dry hops apparent in the finish.
Mild hop bitterness, but I am left wanting something else. Slightly lacking for me, but with a bit of tweaking I think I could get to like this. Needs a bit of ummpphh!"

Dirty, rust colored pour, very murky. No head retention - little lace. Not attractive at all.
Mild sour notes. Not much aroma to speak of. No distinct cherry flavor, but a slight sour fruit based note. Finishes bitter and tart.
Not very interesting, not my cup of tea."

Pour is a little dull - both in terms of the color and the lack of life in the appearance. Very malty aroma, with a touch of marzipan. The nose is the best aspect of this brew.
Taste is a little run of the mill. A little flat and it lacks the sparkle, especially in the light of the Great Lakes O'Fest that I had the other day. I suppose that could be bit of a disadvantage and an unfair comparison, but there it is.
Finish lacks edge.
OK beer, but it lacks sharpness for me. One and done."
Great Lakes Brewing Company,Great Lakes Oktoberfest,,,Märzen / Oktoberfest,6.50%,bottle,4.38,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,1/24/2008,"Thanks go out to nlmartin as part of Secret Santa '07.
12oz bottle. Drinking this a couple of months after the best before date on the bottle. Not to worry, this hasn't suffered much in the interim.
Amazing color on the pour - almost a radioactive orange color - quite stunning. Large head and a great looking beer.
Quintessential Oktoberfest. Great sweet, tasty malts with a nice zing in the finish. Very moreish and a beer that I drank pretty quickly. Lingering malty aftertaste, a really nice example of the style."
Weyerbacher Brewing Co.,Old Heathen Imperial Stout,,,Russian Imperial Stout,8.00%,bottle,2.78,4,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,1/24/2008,"12oz bottle from a recent trip to Greensboro, NC. I *think* this came as a single from either Total Wine in Greensboro or City Beverage in Winston-Salem.
I've had some very good Weyerbacher experiences, and I was hoping for (and expecting) a good experience here too - alas, this wasn't as good as I thought it would be.
Pour is a solid black with a dark brown highlight near the surface. Thin film of mocha head, but no lace to speak of.
Mild solvent and some chocolate in the aroma. 
The disappointing part was the mouthfeel and the taste. It was simply thin, watery and a little tasteless, ESPECIALLY considering the style. Some lactose sweetness, but it's thin - some chocolate but it is diluted - some alcohol but it is a bit too solvent like for me.
In summary this comes up quite a long way short of where it should be. A significant disappointment for me all around."
Jennings Brothers PLC,Jennings Sneck Lifter,,,Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB),5.10%,bottle,4.45,4.5,4,4.5,4,5,1/21/2008,"500 mL bottle, thanks to Dave for putting this one in the line up at his house on my recent trip home to England. Reviewed from notes, Summer 2007.
Not the first time I've drunk this beer, but the overwhelming sensation is still the same this time around in the bottle, as it has been in the past from the cask. A dark pour that is reminiscent of a porter malt base and a very complex beer.
Each mouthful seems different with a combination of stout bitterness, smoke, dark fruits, caramel malts and dry hoppy notes! There's a LOT going on, maybe even too much. Smooth and highly drinkable for me.
Tasty, and frankly a little out of style, but this is still a super brew. Wish I could get it here in the US."
Jolly Pumpkin Artisan Ales,Bam Noire,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,4.30%,bottle,3.8,4,4,4,3,3.5,1/21/2008,"Thanks go out to nlmartin as part of Secret Santa '07. Delighted to get this, as I would probably not be buying this myself.
12oz bottle.
OK, I've been critical of Jolly Pumpkin in the past because of the constant Brett profile of ALL of their beers - I KNOW this is their ""thing"", but it has got very annoying to pick up something labelled as a stout or a Belgian, only to find the funk TOTALLY taking the beer out of style. This is a Saison, so I am HAPPY to have the funk/sourness. IMO there's no point in call something a Belgian Dark and then soaking it in funk.
Anyway, back to this brew. Amber pour that threatens clarity but doesn't quite get there. Decent head and some lace. Looks nice.
Aroma is EXACTLY as one would expect (acidic funk), and threatens the nose as soon as the cap is removed. It's strong.
Decent Saison, but the mouthfeel is a little thin for my liking, and the acididty in general is bigger than than in should be. Lacks the more subtle, musty notes for me. I prefer a more subtle, rounder Saison rather than this acid threat.
Lacks subtlety for me, but at least this is a beer that SHOULD have funk and acidity!"

Poured from the 500 mL bottle bought at the brewery, this looks good. The look is probably the best part of the beer. Amber pour with plenty of clarity. Everything about the beer promises much but ultimately fails to deliver. It's just a bit too light, weak and without presence to make much of an impression on me.



Not sure if I have listed this under the correct style either, so this is a bit of a mystery to me, as is the presence of Guaraná - what's all that about??

Typical light amber pour with a hint of cloudy chill-haze in the appearance.
Light and sparkling with a generous combination of bright malts, refreshing orange zestiness in the hops, and a decent caramel finish. Light drinking, good summer stuff.
Exceptionally tasty, this beer reminds me of a summer shandy. Delicious."

Mildy acidic, but refreshing.



Amber, soapy pour with some sweetness. The beer is balanced with obvious low carbonation but some decent malt presence. There's something else too - perhaps a nuttiness, but may be a little sweeter than that. Not sure, but it seems like a small amount of honeyish hops. Some light fruit.



Typical of the style, with bready malts and simple hop finish. Mild bitterness."

The Keeper's Cottage is a pub that I know very well. Growing up as a young drinker we would sometimes make the short trip out there for a couple of pints. To be honest, the place has seen better days and looks a little run down to me.
Weird looking beer! Yellow hammer is certainly appropraite as this almost looks a little like a Hefe without the huge head! Really, murky yellow pour with an amazing haze. I wanted give it a ""Crazy"" rather than a ""4"". Perhaps this was near the end of the barrel?
Fruit flavors upfront with a little yeastiness and some strong, sweet malts. Hops are floral and the whole package comes together with a very organic feel about it. Grassy even.
Great thirst quencher on a hot summer lunchtime with a rustic cheese and Branston sandwich."
Rex Beverage Holdings,Horny Goat Belgian Style Wheat,,,Witbier,5.20%,can,2.05,3,2,2,2,2,1/20/2008,"Saw this in four packs (encased in a cardboard container like an energy drink) a few times before, and figured it was not good, but then I saw it at Mac's Midtown in Atlanta as part of their ""mix-a-sixer"" so guessed it was worth 1/6 of $7.99!
Poured into the Tucher Weizen glass this has a decent head for a few seconds but then it fades badly. Lace is scant. Body has a classic, hazed lemon look, so that was OK.
Strange, peppery-citrus nose followed by a weak, watery body that lacks banana or clove notes. Spice is not really there either, just white pepper. Odd, marmalade citrus note to the taste as well. Definite orange peel detected.
I dunno, not a very good beer, but a potential option as an introduction to something other than BMC. As such, it might open a door for a few poeple and the can angle is, as usual, interesting.
However, this is not a very high quality beer, and it is CLEARLY relying heavily on marketing (logo, name, general pitch etc.), so don't expect much at all."
St. Austell Brewery,St. Austell Tribute Premium Cornish Ale,,,English Bitter,4.20%,cask,4,4,4,4,4,4,1/20/2008,"This beer was absolutely EVERYWHERE I went in Devon & Cornwall in the Summer of 2007. I drank it on several visits to loads of different pubs. It was mildly depressing that it was so available since it gave the impression that the St. Austell Brewery had become the BMC of the South West. I suppose, since the beer was so solidly good, that was not really such a bad thing!
Standard amber pour with a nice looking bone-white head. Good lace. There's really not much to say about this beer other than it is pretty much perfectly yo style, with a wonderful hop and malt balance that compliment one another to a T. Very moreish, with a dry finish, this is one of those perfectly sessionable, simple ales that make English brewing great.
A great example of a favorite style for me - can't go wrong!"

Pour is a dark, dark brown (basically black) with some dark brown chestnut highlights. Head is dense and creamy, but a little disappointing in terms of its longevity. 
Advertised on the label as a Belgian Style Stout, I would say this is just about exactly what I would imagine a beer in that style to be like. It has the attributes of a Belgian Strong Dark - the usual dark fruits, alcohol notes, sweetness and lovely yeast character - but then the ending cuts in with a really strong licorice bitterness. It’s seldom that I get such a strong sense of flavor, but this is one of those beers that delivers such a thing. A little aniseed in there too.
Reminiscent of Unibroue's Chambly Noire.
Smooth and silky in the mouth, particularly on warming, with some fine carbonation, this is a very drinkable beer. Glad to have a sensible and manageable ABV too, rather than something in the 10-11% range.
Really tasty, I am surprised I like this so much."

Advertised there as an English Amber - whatever the hell that is! Do these people have a CLUE? Anyway - sent one in a frozen glass back, and it's still served too cold.
When it warms, this was much better than I was expecting. A simple pour with good clarity, a bronze body and some half decent lace.
Biscuit malts dominate with a nicely balanced finish. Some hops in the ending. This reminded me a lot of a simple English bitter, and if I could have removed the carbonation and made it warmer this could have been a nice clone of a simple ESB.
Drinkability was pretty good, and I enjoyed the relatively low ABV simplicity. Tasty would be the word. Half-decent, I would visit it again."

Pours as a dark, motor oil like viscous look, but the body drinks a little lighter than the appearance would suggest. Some significant toffee colored yeast deposits sit at the very bottom of the glass. Coffee colored head, not much lace.
Rather sweet. To me this drinks like a Milk Stout. Lots of lactose sweetness. A mild bitterness in the finish but this is really an afterthought. If I had done a blind tasting on this I may have mistaken it for something like Mackeson.
A touch of alcohol in the aftertaste, but this is a pretty mild beer. Sweet is the watch word, and although drinkable, this is not a very balanced brew."
Mendocino Brewing Company,Special Edition - Imperial IPA,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,7.50%,bottle,3.85,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,1/16/2008,"12oz bottle from a six pack.
Light orange pour with a slight haze about it. Mild carbonation. Half inch head that is nice and dense, Some decent lace and retention.
Fresh, zesty hoppy nose. Mild bitterness on the tongue, and to be honest for the style this is pretty tame - I like it because it is balanced with good malt sweetness. Lingering honey like syrup, a nice package. Hops cut in at the finish with a gentle bite.
Well balanced and drinkable. Another decent Winter Seasonal from these folks."

Slightly murky pour, this lacks the absolute clarity that I usually look for in my Brown Ales. Some chill haze.
A little lace, but the head fades pretty quickly. A good sweetness, with some alcohol. Good, strong malts as one should be expecting/looking for, and a pretty solid package.
Although not a real problem, a little too much alcohol seems to be prominent for my liking.
Simple brew, nice job."

Pour is a hazy, golden orange. Plenty of sticky lace and some medium head. Looks inviting.
Citrus is in the nose and the initial taste. Simple brew that has balance and some zest. Lemon notes in there too.
Drinkability is decent, a pretty simple and balanced APA. Alcohol is there, so it doesn't seem especially sessionable to me.
Good quality product from a good, solid brewery."

Bright red color - a bit like that artificial sweet and sour sauce that you sometimes get with Chinese takeway (take-out for the Americans amongst us).
A really genuine raspberry flavor - it tastes like the seeds that come in the real fruit. Very genuine.
Easy drinking, mild tartness, very nice."

Golden hazy pour with a thin film of ""head"" on the surface. Basically no lace.
Strong bubblegum aroma. Sweet in the nose with some artifical (estery) pineapple and some alcohol.
Prickly carbonation in the mouth that I don't much care for, and some drying, medicinal alcohol. Fruity notes are missing. Dry alcohol finish.
OK, but not a very good Tripel IMO."
Meantime Brewing Company Limited,Coffee,,,English Porter,6.00%,bottle,4.45,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,1/11/2008,"$3.99, Brawley's, Charlotte, NC, USA. Love the 11.2oz bottle!
Poured into the new Sam Adams glass. Body is an attractive, bright mid-brown with a cappuccino-like frothy head with is persistent. Looks very much like a cold coffee in the glass with plenty of mocha head on top. A brown ale look. Impressive.
Love the nose! Sweet, mild coffee - great!
Simple, mild coffee is dominant, but it is exactly that - SIMPLE. It's a strong beer because it is easy. Aftertaste has a nice lingering, mild bitterness. Very mild roasty notes that pull the whole thing together. Mouthfeel IS pretty thin, but it works well with the coffee.
Delicious, mild coffee and a simple beer."
Portsmouth Brewery,Portsmouth Kate The Great,,,Russian Imperial Stout,12.00%,growler,4.03,4.5,4,4,4,4,1/11/2008,"Many thanks to Lance for sharing the Growler. Shared at The Brick Store with a few of the usual suspects.
Poured into the tulip, the body is jet black with a nice mocha head. At first the aroma and taste are both simply solvent like - very strong alcohol, almost varnish like. The alcohol was all I got initially, and I described the finish as basically vodka-like. It was not a good start for me.
However, this beer changed just about more than any other I have tasted as it warmed. And I don't mean gradually over a 45 or 60 minute period, I mean dramatically within 5-10 minutes.
It quickly became smooth, full in the mouth a classic, alcohol laden RIS.
I enjoyed it, but to me this is not as huge a stand-out as the reviews suggest, rather a simple but good RIS."
Smuttynose Brewing Company,Smuttynose Portsmouth Lager,,,Vienna Lager,4.50%,bottle,3.95,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,1/11/2008,"Thanks go out to someone for a recent trade (you know who you are). 12oz bottle.
Lively pour with a lot of initial carbonation. Fine bubbles. Very good head and lace and some persistent carbonation. 
Light honey colored, hazed body. Creamy mouth feel from the fine carbonation.
Some biiterness sits against the substantial malt backbone. Not a sharp bitterness, rather a linger dull bitter profile. A little metallic in the finish, certainly lacks much of a sweet touch.
Drinkable, but more like an edgy, English IPA to me with plenty of bitterness all arpund. Enjoyable."
Grado Plato,Chocarrubica,,,Oatmeal Stout,7.00%,bottle,1.53,3,1,1.5,3,1,1/9/2008,"Thanks to Simon for the opportunity.
Haven't really got a clue what was going on here. The beer opened with a mighty ""pop"" which sounded promising, but unfortunately that was the best of the experience.
Poured a dark brown, porter-like color which (at least from looks alone) reminded me somewhat of the Ommegang Chocolate Indulgance. Some decent head (for a few seconds) that fell away quickly to not much. A little lifeless.
Aroma was mildly rancid, with a lingering old socks note.
Drinkability was close to zero for me, with a combination of old farmhouse funk, but a rancidness that almost made me gag. It quite literally smelled very strongly of cheese - and not a good cheese either.
What the hell they were trying to achieve is beyond me."
Harpoon Brewery,Harpoon Barleywine (100 Barrel Series #04),,,American Barleywine,10.30%,bottle,3.23,3,2,3.5,3,4,1/5/2008,"22oz bomber, as part of a recent trade - sorry, I forgot who - gold foiled neck, typical series presentation. Poured into the oversized wine glass.
Hazy orange pour with a soap film on the surface. Alcohol legs, but no head as such.
Sweet malty nose, but (surprisingly) lacks alcohol presence. In fact a serious lack of aroma.
Balance, but surprisingly lacks bite for an American Barleywine. DISTINCT lack of length in the flavor and taste (aftertaste). This would be OK if it hit some English Barleywine, sweet notes, but it doesn't! All in all a bit odd. Pedestrian. Falls between two stools.
To be fair as it warms it improves a little - but not much. 
Drinks nowhere near 10.3%, in fact to the point of me actually not believing it! Very light and easy drinking for the style and the published ABV. I dunno, another average offering in the series - time to step up Harpoon!"
Brasserie Lefèbvre SA,Barbãr Winterbok / Barbãr De Noël,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,8.00%,bottle,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,1/4/2008,"Thanks go out nlmartin as part of Secret Santa 2007. 11.2 fl oz, best before 22/08/2009.
Poured into the Gouden Carolus chalice, this creates a lovely chestnut brown pour with plenty of creamy, foamy head and some whippy lace.
A little whiff of alcohol in the nose, with some dark fruit.
Sweet fruits. Alcohol is present but it is seems to evaporate quickly to reveal the fruit component. Rich and creamy with an almost brandylike finish. Probably too sweet for many.
Delicious, one of the tastiest brews I've had in sometime."
Weyerbacher Brewing Co.,Hops Infusion,,,American IPA,6.20%,bottle,3.73,3.5,3,4,3.5,4,1/3/2008,"12oz bottle purchased in Greensboro, NC, USA as a single - Total Wine. Non-descript code toward the bottom of bottle 4123061070221. Poured in to the 16oz shaker pint.
Aggressive pour leads to a nice half-inch head (pillow like) and some good, well defined lace. A light copper colored body with very slight haze. Some mild carbonation.
Nose certainly does not reflect much hoppiness. Clean and simple, a nice IPA and a welcome change of pace from the massive hop profiles that STILL seem to be en vogue and hanging on Stateside. Some malt sweetness up front and a simple, midly bitter hop finish.
Name is a bit misleading, as I was led to believe this was going to be another ridiculous US hop bomb, but I was pleasantly surpised at the simplicity and balance of this beer. Good, eveyday drinking methinks."
Harpoon Brewery,Harpoon Weizenbock (100 Barrel Series #21),,,Weizenbock,7.80%,bottle,3.43,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,1/2/2008,"Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA. $4.99, 22oz bomber, gold foiled top presentation as usual for the series.
A mixed bag for the appearance; great, deep garnet color with good clarity, but the almost complete lack of carbonation, head and lace is disappointing.
Plenty of banana notes in the nose and tastes, with some residual sweetness in the finish. A slight grape like, wine character too. Finishes with some fruit and bitterness.
One of my favorite styles, this came up a little short for me. It just lacked real depth for me. I wanted a richer feel both in the taste and the mouthfeel - a bit light I thought."
Jolly Pumpkin Artisan Ales,Noel De Calabaza,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,9.00%,bottle,2.33,2.5,3,2,3,2,1/1/2008,"Thanks go out to nlmartin as part of 2007 Secret Santa. I'm grateful to him because I would probably not have bought this myself, but at the same time I am always interested to try something new and different. 750 mL bottle. Blend #002.
I dunno, I guess this is just another Jolly Pumpkin brew that I don't really get.
Chestnut brown pour with some red highlights and some floaties. Little or no head, a little bit lifeless in fact.
Funky sourness dominates to the point that this just becomes another JP experience for me. I have simply found their beers to be very one-dimensional and lacking complexity. They just seem to be bleh...I'm also frustrated by the Belgian Dark label. Essentially this is just a funky beer with nothing much else to attract me - another JP letdown."
Southern Tier Brewing Company,IPA (India Pale Ale),,,American IPA,6.90%,bottle,3.98,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,1/1/2008,"Part of a mixed 12 pack (along with the Porter, Raspberry Wheat and Phin & Matt's). 12oz bottle.
Pretty much a perfect example of the style. Light orange, slightly hazed pour with a large, bone-white, billowing head. Lots of sticky lace - a classic and good sign in this style.
Nice sweet and bitter combo on the tongue with the hops winning in the finish. Standard mouthfeel with a little prickly carbonation. A slight metallic nature too. Drinks more like a sessionable ABV than the 6.5%.
Easy, everyday drinking, probably something that New Yorkers have in their fridge on a regular basis."
Sprecher Brewing Company,Scotch Style Ale Aged In  Oak Bourbon Barrels,,,Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy,10.20%,bottle,4.43,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,1/1/2008,"Thanks go out to fellow BA nlmartin for this beer as part of Secret Santa 2007. 1L, swing-top, impressive bottle. Shared on Christmas Day with the family.
I am generally not a huge fan Bourbon based beers simply because I often find that the Bourbon taste has the tendency to overwhelm the brew. Because of that fear I was delighted at the general smoothness of this. Yes it certainly had the Bourbon traits in the nose and in the taste, but it was a taste that melded all the malts and alcohol perfectly together.
Warmth and softness in the mouth. Delighted that the brew was not too edgy.
Very silky and smooth, and very well balanced. One of the few Bourbon based beers that I have really enjoyed to the full."
Weyerbacher Brewing Co.,Quad,,,Quadrupel (Quad),11.80%,bottle,3.63,3,4,3.5,4,3.5,12/31/2007,"22oz bomber, $5.99 City Beverage, Winston-Salem, NC, USA. This (vintage?) is advertised as being 11.8% on the label.
Dark, burned orange color with a little film of head on the surface of the glass as it sits in the Urthel, Hop-iT goblet. Lace is thin and wispy and only at the extreme edges of the surface.
Aroma is brown sugar and some strong bubblegum.
Very sweet, with alcohol fairly well hidden until the finish at which point it cuts in fairly strongly, but is still more subtley warming just a few seconds after the swallow. Plenty of fruits - pear, pineapple, other alcoholic, phenolic and solvent based esters.
Despite the alcohol, the mouthfeel doesn't suffer too much and manages to stay away from the syrupy gloop that sometimes can invade this type of brew.
A little better than average, but this is not a stunning Quad, nor is it one of Weyerbacher's best efforts."
Southern Tier Brewing Company,Raspberry Wheat Ale,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,4.50%,bottle,3.03,3.5,3,3,3,3,12/28/2007,"12oz bottle as part of the Southern Tier mixed 12 pack (IPA, Porter and Phin & Matt's) make up the remainder. Given to me as a Xmas present - Cheers Rob.
Macro colored pour, but better than average carbonation, with a small, perfectly formed head and some minor lace. Surprising clarity for a ""wheat"" - filtered I guess??
Aroma is that of watered down raspberries with a somewhat synthetic feel. Not all that promising.
A dryish fruitiness meets the tastebuds at first, at this is not that bad. Initially this is a watery fruit flavor, but it fades to yield a sort of nasty, dry candy sweetness (like American Sweetarts). Taste, mouthfeel and drinkability are all about average for a beer of its kind. Keep your expectations in check and you'll be happy.
One for the ladies perhaps, this is not really my idea of a good beer, BUT having said that I don't mind this kind of thing from time to time just as a change of pace. Much better in the summer, at the beach, but something I can at least relate to for what it is, and what it is trying to be - don't expect too much and you'll probably be happy."

Second bottle from the Greensboro trip in Novemeber 2007. 
Looks and drinks more like a Dubbel than I remember from before. Sweet raisin notes still there in the nose which is perhaps the best aspect of this beer. The 22oz Ter"
Three Floyds Brewing Co. / Brewery & Pub,Behemoth Blonde Barleywine,,,American Barleywine,10.50%,bottle,4.23,4,4,4.5,4,4,12/25/2007,"Behemoth Blonde – Thanks go out to nlmartin as part of my 2007 Secret Santa. 22oz bomber.
Dark orange pour from the typically, colorful FFF artwork festooned and yellow-wax dipped bottle. Pretty cloudy with a viscous (as expected) body, with some bubbly head (after the aggressive pour), but (as expected) little or no lace.
Sweet and malty alcoholic nose. 
Very sweet initial tastes accompanied by a syrupy mouthfeel. Alcohol is apparent upfront too. Then the finish cuts in with the typical American Barleywine hops. Interesting brew because it starts as a more traditionally English BW with lots of sweetness and alcohol, but then finishes in a much more typically American fashion. 
Even though the alcohol wasn’t overwhelming, it did seem to take me a much longer period of time than normal to finish this (even considering the style). A bit of a sipper for me."
Shmaltz Brewing Company (He'Brew),Coney Island Lager,,,American Amber / Red Lager,5.50%,bottle,4.33,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,12/23/2007,"Unexpectedly came across this at Jax, Sandy Springs, Atlanta, GA, USA. Think it was about $4 for the 22oz bomber. Crazy label in line with Shmaltz off the wall marketing.
Pour is a simple, but nicely clear amber body with some good soapy head and lace. Lovely balance in the nose and on the palate. Very English style biscuit malts are complimented with a certain richness. Some bitterness in the hoppy(ish) finish. Lovely sweet, moreish and rich aftertaste for a lager. A little Brown Ale like. Really tasty.
Very light drinking, but at the same time very satisfying and tasty. An unusual combo of taste, drinkability and balance.
A brewery that I am growing to think more and more of with each passing beer. Excellent stuff."
Bison Brewing Co.,Bison Organic Chocolate Stout,,,American Stout,5.00%,bottle,3.88,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,12/22/2007,"12oz single from Total Wine, Kennesaw, GA, USA.
Black pour with some impressive ruby red highlights especially a the bottom of the pint glass. Spotty, creamy head (after an aggressive pour), but not much lace. 
Nose contains a cocoa based, dry chocolate powder. The taste however goes the other way and had plenty of milky chocolate creaminess - the full chocolate spectrum. The finish is especially milky and creamy.
I enjoyed this more than I thought I might. A manageable ABV and a creamy beer without being massive. A nice, sensible compromise rather than some kind of HUGE stout that often comes in the chocolate category."
Russian River Brewing Company,Perdition,,,Bière de Garde,6.10%,bottle,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,12/21/2007,"Thanks go out to jgaston for the trade.
750 mL, corked & caged affair. Batch 002. Poured into the Duvel tulip. Significantly darker body than I was expecting. Plenty of floaties in the glass too. Nice head, but relatively short lived and not much lace.
Some tart funky yeast in the nose, but all fairly muted. Tastes reflect the nose. Yeasty tartness is the overwhelming sensation with a bitter finish. Some unsweetened grapefruit also present in the ending.
Not quite as smooth as I was expecting, a little on the edgy side. Some rounding out as the bottle warms, and there seems to be more to this as one drinks more. Certainly tasty, but not really up my alley."
Ridgeway Brewing,Seriously Bad Elf,,,English Strong Ale,9.00%,bottle,2.58,4,3,2.5,2.5,2,12/20/2007,"2007 version, $5.45 at Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA. 500 mL brown bottle. I've been waiting to try this to complete my ""Elf"" experience. Having had the excpetionally good ""Insanely Bad"" a couple of days ago, this was disappointing.
Clear, golden pour with better than expected carbonation. Some lace and a thin head. Looks good in the 20 oz pint glass. Aroma is alcoholic fruit.
Slightly viscous mouthfeel and the alcohol is definitely very apparent. It has the taste of some alcoholic pears and perhaps a hint of pineapple. A wee bit solvent like.
This is a bit too alcoholic for me, and it is not all that well balanced. It seems a bit too raw and solvent based."
Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Grotten Flemish Ale,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,7.70%,bottle,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,12/19/2007,"$8.99 at Brawley's, Charlotte, NA, USA. Corked & Caged 750 mL. 
Since this said ""Flanders Ale"" on the bottle, I was wondering if this was going to be a Flemish Sour/Red style - Mike put me right.
Poured into the Duvel tulip (seemed appropriate), the head is initially big, but slips away somewhat disappointingly but leaving some lace.
Very yeasty nose with an element of tart fruit. The yeast is replicated in the taste, but the tartness is not. Simple mouthfeel and a pretty average Belgian Pale all around. Some mild white pepper and a TINY bit of spice round out some alcohol in the finish and a little dry character.
To be brutally honest a very standard, good, simple but average Belgian Pale Ale. Nothing wrong with that, in fact it's one of my favorite styles, but I was expecting more from the ""Signature Edition"". Ultimately, although solid, this came up at best only a touch above average and at worst a little short of expectations. Better options out there IMO."
Mikkeller,Beer Geek Breakfast,,,American Double / Imperial Stout,7.50%,bottle,3.65,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,12/19/2007,"$11.99 Brawley's, Charlotte, NC, USA. 22oz bomber long before this came to GA.
Inky, black pour with a generous, thick mocha head. Some lace. Bready (brown bread) nose with a little coffee, but not as much as I was anticipating.
Mouthfeel and alcohol are quite reserved for the style, neither really coming on strong in body of the beer, but a little more alcohol in the finish. Coffee bitterness comes into its own as the mouthful goes down.
Nice beer that I enjoyed but somewhat over-hyped I feel, and perhaps the weakest of their brews I have had so far."
Barons Brewing Company,Barons Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),4.60%,bottle,3.03,3.5,3,3,3,3,12/18/2007,"12oz single from Tower, Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Golden yellow pour with a standard macro look. head is decent with some sticky lace. Above average persistence. Slightly above average on the appearance front. Fine carbonation is persistent and pleasing.
Sweet alcohol nose. Mild hops; semi-sweet malts hold the beer together.
Average mouthfeel. Lager attributes rather than ""ale like"".
Refreshing, clean and some taste, but ultimately forgetable in every respect. Nothing offensive, just nothing to suggest this is any different to 1000's of other similar beers. Ho hum, it's one and done here."
Brewery Ommegang,Chocolate Indulgence Stout,,,Belgian Dark Ale,7.00%,bottle,3.8,4,3,4,4,4,12/16/2007,"Not at all sure what to make of this - a bit odd in many respects. 750 mL corked & caged.
First off I bought this several months ago at Minks on Delk Road, Marietta, GA, USA. When I took it to the register the guy tried to convince me that this was the follow-up to Donkey Punch by Sweetwater - Jeeezzz! When challenged he told me, ""that's what the distributor told me"". Good God, my six year old knows more. Anyway...
....turbid brown pour into the Urthel stemmed tulip. Spotty head and some lace.
This is an odd bird indeed. Essentially I think it has all the characteristics of a Porter and nothing to do with a Belgian Dark. Creamy mouthfeel. A little Belgian yeast but not much else to convince me of a Belgian origin. Some mild burned malts and INDEED some chocolate.
Don't get me wrong I love Ommegang AND I like this beer, but what IS it?? Strange."
Lagunitas Brewing Company,Lumpy Gravy,,,American Brown Ale,7.20%,bottle,4.03,4.5,4,4,4,4,12/15/2007,"22 oz bomber cracked by Dave at The Brick Store, Decatur, GA, USA. Subsequently in many samples after that.
The usual Frank Zappa crazy label. Pour reveals a deep, mahogany, rich brown body with some red highlights. Head is good, plenty of thickish lace. Sticky.
Malts are large and smooth with a good bit of residual sweetness. A touch of hop bitterness in the finish but not much to speak of. 
Smooth and satisfying mouthfeel. Nice brew. Not necessarily what I was expecting from Lagunitas as the hops were toned down and this was very nicely balanced. Is this really from the West Coast??!!
Very drinkable and typically ""Americanized"" Brown Ale (i.e. much larger than its English origin in most respects)."
Natty Greene's Pub & Brewing Co.,Bayonet ESB,,,Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB),6.20%,on-tap,3.15,3,3,3,3.5,3.5,12/15/2007,"On tap at Old Town, Greensboro, NC, USA.
If I were scoring this within style I don't think it would do very well at all. Essentially this strikes me as an English IPA - by that I mean far too hoppy for an English style ESB, but not big enough on the hops for an American IPA. Strange beast.
Light orange pour (typically IPAish) with some head. A little lace. This would need to be browner for an ESB methinks. Some malts, but they are put in the background by the hop profile, which although quite small is still too big for the beer IMO.
Tastes decent and is drinkable, but not sure of what the brewer is trying to achieve here. A little bit of a misfit IMO."
Russian River Brewing Company,Redemption,,,Belgian Pale Ale,5.20%,bottle,3.88,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,12/15/2007,"Thanks go out to jgaston for the trade. Apparently, $6.99 from Ledger's Liquors.
Corked & Caged 750 mL presentation. Poured into the Duvel tulip. Golden/yellow hazy pour with plenty of floaties. Thin head, minimal; wispy lace.
Lack of body and lack of depth IN THE GLASS make this a tad disappointing initially - but it gets much better. Plenty of good Belgian yeast notes in the nose. Not much else. Reminds me of a Wit.
Tastes are simple. Very, very mild spice and a touch of yeast. Mouthfeel is better than the head would suggest. Some slight bitterness and tartness in the finish, but it's not much.
I would put this in the category of an everyday Belgian. My guess is that this beer will be HORRIBLY under-appreciated in the US becasue these subtle, low ABV, mild brews are not widely accepted here. That problem is probably exacerbated by the ""Russian River"" factor where many drinkers are looking for some HUGE impact - this is a nice beer that might be too subtle for many US based BA's."

Not a Winter Warmer in the US sense of the style, this is a simple, but delicious malty and caramel based ESB/Bitter/Brown Ale cross. HUGE, frothy and creamy head atop a beautifully clear, dark brown body with plenty of impressive lace on the glass. Looks AMAZING!
Tasty malts dominate. This is VERY English with the Maris Otter also coming through some. Moreish taste. This is the kind of beer I expect to drink in the midst of the Peak District countryside on a Saturday night after driving up from London and a day of walking. SUPERB!
Draught versions would likely be off the charts, this is simply stunning!"

22oz bomber shared with a few BA's at The Brick Store, Decatur, GA, USA.
I was a little wary of this since I have grown not to like many bourbon aged/infused beers, and often I find the simple oak aged to be a little overpowering as well. This was one of the more subtle ones I have tried.
Mahogany brown pour with not much carbonation (ABV 11.8%), but nevertheless still some head and lace. Still looking pour. Nice sweet aroma of brown sugar and a little oakiness, but the biggest upfront taste to me was a mild, warming liquor.
Very drinkable considering the ABV, and although some alcohol was there in the taste it did not overwhelm things. A little viscous in the mouth but that was to be expected.
A little removed from a classic Quad, but an enjoyable one nonetheless. I was glad to share this because of the ABV and the richness of the brew. 22oz would be a lot to enjoy on ones own."
Two Brothers Brewing Company,Prairie Path Ale,,,Belgian Pale Ale,5.10%,bottle,3.03,3.5,3,3,3,3,12/14/2007,"12oz bottle. Thanks go out to Vancer as part of Old Farts/CEO BIF.
Golden/orange hazed pour with some decent carbonation. Head is small, but does come with some lace and is creamy. 
I really don't get much Belgian character here. Not much sugar or prominent yeast note, nor is there enough alcohol for me. This drinks like a malty Pils or a Kolsch, but looks more like a diluted Dunkelweizen - all a little odd. A very small amount of mild spice.
A slight Saaz bitterness in the finish (a little Pils like), but not much. All in all pretty bland and a little blah, but not offensive. Don't think I would bother again."
Boulevard Brewing Co.,Lunar,,,American Dark Wheat Ale,5.10%,bottle,3,2,3.5,3,2.5,3,12/13/2007,"12oz stubbie bottle. I'm drinking this a few weeks after the best before date - I doubt that it will matter much.
Thanks go out to Vancer as part of CEO/Old Farts BIF.
Disappointing pour. The beer has the appearance of a Belgian Dubbel or perhaps even a Delerium Nocturnum. Odd combination of prickly carbonation and TOTAL lack of head. What's that about?? The flat appearance, dirty color and lack of life make this beer look drab. Very uninteresting.
Taste is an usual combination of a Dunkel and a brown ale. Sweetness is there, as is some very mild banana and clove. Not much, and a little thin in the mouth.
Very average brew."
The Duck-Rabbit Craft Brewery,Duck-Rabbit Rabid Duck,,,Russian Imperial Stout,10.00%,bottle,3.63,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,12/13/2007,"12oz single purchased on a recent trip to Greensboro, NC, USA before this made it to GA.
Typical motor oil pour with some good looking Mocha/tan head. Lace is scant. Nose and taste represent a mild, milk chocolate lightly roasted malt. A hint of alcohol in the nose. Some darker cooking chocolate/Bourneville in the taste. A touch of bitterness.
Slightly thin for the style and this brew lacks a little of the mouth coating attributes that one might have expected.
A little smoke in the finish and some bigger solvent like alcohol. Not the greatest RIS on the planet, but nonetheless a decent example of the style and I enjoyed it."
"Marston, Thompson & Evershed, Plc.",Single Malt,,,English Pale Ale,4.20%,bottle,3.85,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,12/9/2007,"Notes taken from England trip 2007. Cheers Chris!
Label different to the one in the BA db. Orange, amber hue. Pour gives some nice soapy head and some simple lace. Head is small, but present.
The name of this beer is related to the fact that it is brewed with 100% Golden Promise Malt that is used in whisky manufacture. The combination gives a subtle beer that is both sweet and dry(!).
Typically aromatic English Pale that is dominated by the moreish, toasty, biscuit like malts, although this seems to offer more alcohol presence than I was expecting.
Nice brew. Simple and refreshing, well worth a visit IMO."
Natty Greene's Pub & Brewing Co.,Slam Dunkelweizen,,,Dunkelweizen,5.10%,on-tap,3.63,3,3.5,3.5,4,4,12/9/2007,"On tap at the Brewpub. 16 oz pint serving.
A little difficult to tell the color of this beer in the dark, smoke filled room, but it looked a little lighter than the murky brown that I was expecting. A little clearer than the norm and more orange like.
Some clove and banana nose which faded to leave a bit of an oatmeal taste. The oatmeal flavor added to the body of the beer that was perhaps its best characteristic. Sweet finish that made this easy to put down.
Not a huge fan of the style, but this was moreish and quite drinkable."
Otter Brewery Ltd,Hoppy Otter IPA,,,English India Pale Ale (IPA),6.80%,bottle,4.03,4.5,4,4,4,4,12/9/2007,"Delighted to discover this sitting at Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA. $3.99 for the 500 mL bottle. Attractive bottle and nice green label complete the presentation.
Noisy pour into the shaker pint yelds a bright, clear amber body, soapy head and some lace. Looks very nice.
The label boasts the combination of spring water from the river Otter in Devon (a few miles from my birthpalce and home), English floor malts, their own yeast and whole cone hops from the West Coast of the USA. This leads to a very aromatic nose - grassy freshness.
Quite a dry bitterness which was NOT what I was expecting. There is definitely a USA/UK IPA crossbred beer here. Has some simple, subtle notes of mild hop character that you might expect from an English version, but also plenty of citrus puckering notes from the West Coast. Also an unusual dry element as well. Put it at 6.8% too (a sort of low/high cross), and you have a real new/old school mixture.
Dry ending lingers. Very interesting. The first English/American IPA cross?"

WOW! Best beer I've had in some time. Pour is a BEAUTIFUL, honey amber body with amazing clarity, a fantastic head and some nice lace. Carbonation is mild, but good. Nose is alcohol based, but not too harsh.
I'm not sure about the BA ""English Strong Ale"" categorization, or indeed the ""Imperial Red Ale"" on the bottle label, this seems to me to be a simple, classic English Barleywine - sweet and VERY high alcohol. The really amazing thing about this is the lack of alcohol presence - I cannot believe that this is over 11%.
Astonishingly smooth. Velvet like. Stunning. Mid level viscosity.
It IS very sweet, but is has really, really subtle maderia and sherry notes and a lingering aftertaste that exudes class.
BRILLIANT!"
Stone Brewing Co.,Stone 07.07.07 Vertical Epic,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,8.40%,bottle,3.6,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,12/9/2007,"Had a chance to try this for the first time back in July (just after its release) at a Brick Store, BA get together but I didn't take notes. Thanks go out of Bleedingshrimp for the trade, and for the opportunity to get a crack at this one again.
22 oz bomber. Poured into the Duvel tulip.
Very deep, bright orange color (marmalade like) that belies the ""Pale"" part of the moniker. Alcohol and citrus based spices in the nose.
Wow - there's a lot going on here. Hot alcohol, spice and citrus notes. Lime, ornage peel and some tumeric. Mild alcohol burn. A touch of sweetened grapefruit in the background. White pepper cuts across the finish with vigor. This is a little busy at the moment.
Carbonation seems a little low to me, which means the beer lacks a life. Not exactly flat, but it seems a tad tired.
Even at 5-6 months, this would benefit from some more age to mellow it out I feel, BUT I worry about what time may do to the carbonation. On one hand this needs to develop a bit, on the other it may get even more lacklustre in the carbonation department.
Not the best of the VE series that I have had, but still a tasty beer. This is one which will definitely benefit from cellaring I think. The lack of carbonation worries me a bit though."
Flying Dog Brewery,Wild Dog Collaborator Doppelbock,,,Doppelbock,8.30%,bottle,3.63,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,12/8/2007,"Purchased on recent trip to SC, at Green's. $13.99, 750 mL corked & caged.
Great looking, clear, red pour with a small head and some lace. Looks liek an Imperial Red Ale.
Fruity nose with plenty of apples. Smooth with a little alcohol in the dry finish. Alcohol is not as pronounced as I was expecting, and this drinks pretty easily. Malty (obviously), but with a small bitterness in there to balance the whole package.
A little more reserved than I was expecting, especially in the recent wake of some less than subtle Flying Dog, big brews."
Mikkeller,Black Hole,,,Russian Imperial Stout,13.10%,bottle,4.08,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,12/8/2007,"So I stroll into Green's, Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA and take a look inside the Belgian walk-in and I see a bottle of silver foiled neck, Black Hole. It appears to be $9.95, and given that RIS is by no means my favorite stlye, AND I am really wary of the hype associated with many beers, I elect to pass. Anyway, off I go to The Brick Store, Decatur , GA, USA (10 minutes down the road) and Dave insists on cracking a bottle of the same for ""research purposes"".
Pretty much exactly as you would expect. Jet black, thin film of mocha head, very little lace. Coffee is big in the nose and the taste with PLENTY of mouth coating film. Big, rich, subtle and all just about in check, this is essentially what you would expect for the style, the brewer and the beer. The label checks this in at 13.1%, so it's a big brew on all fronts. Mild alcohol burn in the finish.
Drinkable (in small quantities), this is a classy brew but just too immense for anything other than the odd, time to time visit."
"Bell's Brewery, Inc.",Bell's Amber Ale,,,American Amber / Red Ale,5.50%,bottle,3.6,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,12/6/2007,"I first drank ths on a trip to Lexington, KY a couple of years ago, and this bottle came from a recent haul from a trip to Greensboro, NC, USA.
12 oz single from Total Wine. 8136 Dot-Matrixed on the rear - Batch # maybe??
Hazy orange pour with good carbonation and a perfectly formed dense, bone-white head. Some lace. Sweet and creamy aroma makes its way out of the glass.
Sweet and rich malts dominate, with a slender, dry finish. Very mild English Toffee, perhaps a hint of caramel too, but not much. Well balanced. Simple brew.
Lacks the dry character sometimes associated with the style and is smoother and sweeter than many of its ilk. Essentially a good multi-purpose beer with sessionable traits even if not quite sessionable by ABV terms."
Rogue Brewery (Brewer's on the Bay),Kells Irish Style Lager,,,Euro Pale Lager,5.00%,bottle,3.03,3.5,2.5,3,3,3.5,12/2/2007,"$5.49, City Beverage, Winston-Salem, NC, USA. 22oz bomber. One of the few Rogue offerings that we do not get in GA so I thought I should pick it up.
Nice pour. Plenty of decent head and some lace. Slighly clouded appearance with some honey color in the body. Head and lace have some retention, but not a great deal. Not much aroma - small amount of grain perhaps??
Frankly a very ordinary lager. Mild sweetness, slight bitterness in the finish, simple and refreshing, but not much else to report. Very average IMO.
Inoffensive but absolutely NO reason to buy this more than once."
Southampton Publick House,Southampton Pumpkin Ale,,,Pumpkin Ale,5.50%,bottle,3.93,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,12/2/2007,"22 oz bomber from City Beverage, Winston-Salem, NC, USA. $5.49.
I guess that this is the beer that finally tells me that I am not that keen on Pumpkin brews! The reason I say that is that I imagine this is pretty much as good as it gets within the style, and despite that I'm just not mad about it.
Beautiful clarity in the pour with a bright, light amber, dark orange body. Nice carbonation, super head and some lace. The body of this beer is very attractive.
Both the aroma and taste at least FEATURE the pumpkin, cinnamon and allspice advertised, but they are not huge. Drinks slightly more like a Marzen or O'Fest with an almost lager-like lightness. Some residual sweetness in the finish.
As I say, I think that this beer is a super example of the style but it doesn't do a lot for me."
Allagash Brewing Company,Allagash Curieux (Bourbon Barrel-Aged Tripel),,,Tripel,11.00%,bottle,3.6,4,3.5,4,3,3,12/1/2007,"Purchased on recent trip to Greensboro, NC, USA. A mistake because it arrived in GA while I was out of state!
Corked & Caged 750 mL bottle.
Poured into the Duvel tulip, this is basically a slightly darker Belgian Pale. Honey colored. Creamy, small head with some lace. Aroma has some yeast, but is dominated by an alcohol solvent smell. Quite strong, not exactly sinus clearing but nevertheless very noticeable.
Belgian yeast character, but two things come on strong. The Bourbon taste (that frankly I am not wild about) and the alcohol solvent. The alcohol is not quite as bad as the aroma would have you think, but it is still prevelant. It gets better toward the bottom of the 750, but I wonder if that is alcohol taking its toll! Obviously, plenty of candy sweetness (Tripel). Some light pear and pineapple, but these fruits are Bourbon soaked!
Mouthfeel is just about average for this kind of brew, but the drinkability is not that high for me. I would even consider this as an alternative to liquor - maybe as a quick nightcap at the end of a big night.
Bourbon beers are a bit hit and miss with me, and frankly I need to be in the mood as much as anything else."
Hook Norton Brewery Co. Ltd.,Twelve Days,,,English Strong Ale,5.50%,bottle,4,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,12/1/2007,"Both amazed and delighted to find a Hook Norton product at Green's on Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA. $4.95 for the 500 mL bottle. One of the best English brewers in days gone by, I'm about to catch up with one of their newer products. Tall and slim bottle, heavy brown glass with an elaborate tree motif embossed toward the bottom of the botlle. Very nice presentation.
Pours very much like a Brown Ale. Disappointing lack of head, retention and lace UNLESS the pour is aggressive. When the pour is more aggressive you get a much happier, creamy head. Nice clarity; very little carbonation.
A little chocolate in the nose which is not repeated in the taste. Simple, sweet malty nuttiness in the initial tastes. A tiny bitterness in the finish.
Very tasty, I could easy session a few of these, despite the higher ABV than you would usually think of. Tasty beer, a nice product."
Kaltenberg International / König Ludwig International GmbH & Co.KG,König Ludwig Weiss (Royal Bavarian Hefe-Weizen),,,Hefeweizen,5.50%,bottle,2.85,3,2.5,3,2.5,3,12/1/2007,"Grabbed this one as part of a bunch of singles from Total Wine in Kennesaw, GA, USA. 11.2oz (330 mL) bottle.
Strange look - complete clarity and a macro lager appearance until the yeast comes up from the bottom of the bottle. Small head, little retention and little lace. Lacks typical cloudy body. Very mild banana in the nose, some bubblegum in the taste.
Weak mouthfeel, disappointingly watery.
In short, a horribly lightweight Hefe."
Murphy Brewery Ireland Limited,Murphy's Irish Red Beer,,,Irish Red Ale,5.00%,bottle,3,3,3,3,3,3,12/1/2007,"Single 12oz from Total Wine in Greensboro, NC, USA.
WTF is this?? Has the color of a macro lager, tastes like a sweet version of the same thing, and in addition it lacks any appearance or characteristic of an Irish Red. Most importantly no dry finish. Soap like aroma without that soap turning into hop bitterness as it usually does.
I don't understand this at all. It's almost as if the wrong beer had been put into the (attractive) bottle. 
It pours with a decent head and some lace, and doesn't look bad, it just doesn't look like an Irish Red. If we are talking ""in style"" then this is getting horrible scores. The fact I CAN drink it, and it looks OK means I have to score this average. Odd.
I just don't get it. I was expecting a dry, red colored brew - this was nothing like that!!??"
Red Brick Brewing Company,#'s Ale,,,English Bitter,?,bottle,4.03,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,12/1/2007,"Part of a sixer from Green's, Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA. 12oz bottle.
Great looking pour into the Young's Imperial Pint glass. Big, billowing head and some nice lace - good retention too. Light copper color with very good clarity and some fine, but very nice carbonation. Pretty darn good looking beer.
Soft, soapy hops in the nose but this is very reserved. Taste shows somthing unusual - a simple, balanced and well made beer that is not trying to prove anything, rather it is content to be a simply made GOOD beer. Balanced grainy sweetness and noticeable mild, soapy bitterness in the finish.
In a nutshell, refreshing, simple, tasty and very drinkable - a well put together, simple easy drinking beer.

Big 'ole malty noisy pour and look. Good head but a surprisigly lack of lace. Rich, thick mouthfeel. Creamy.
The smoke comes through strong, and frankly this is NOT my favorite feature of a beer (even though this is at least part of the point here). Drinkability suffers for me.
Smoke overwhelms this a bit for me and there is a lack of subtlety."
Weyerbacher Brewing Co.,Eleven,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,11.70%,bottle,3.48,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,11/25/2007,"22 oz bomber, purchased at City Beverage, Winston-Salem, NC, USA. A ""Triple IPA""??
Pour is a dark orange pour with plenty of head and some superb lace. Hoppy nose, but this is balanced in the aroma with lots of sugary sweetness. Considering the ABV it is also well carbonated.
Sugary sweetness is the feature here. Metallic hop presence also features in the finish. Syrupy sweet mouthfeel makes this quite slick. Considering the ABV of 11.7 %, this is relatively drinkable and the alcohol is well hidden. That's not to say that it isn't there - obviously it is - but when you think this is nearly a 12% beer it drinks OK.
I dunno, I'm getting a bit tired of all these massive IPA's, what about some subtlety?"
"Anheuser-Busch, Inc.",Bud Light Chelada,,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,4.20%,can,2.03,1.5,2.5,2,2.5,1.5,11/24/2007,"Well, well, well, you never know what's going to happen, do you? I pop into Taco Mac in Douglasville, GA, USA for a quick beer on a Saturday afternoon, and they are giving out 16oz cans of this stuff for free - being a true BA, I felt I HAD to a least try it, so I did! (The bar staff told me there was a regular Bud version too but I suggested that it probably wouldn't matter - perhaps I'll never know!)
Pour is briefly fizzy and then settles to give a horrible, peach/orange colored liquid. Looks a little like one of those V8 Fruit Splash drinks. Aroma is tomato juice based initially, but then fades. The taste is similar in as much as it starts out tomato juice based, but then fades quickly to give a watery consistency with some fizz. A little spice (or is it just salt?). Perhaps a little spice or celery, but not much.
I could see drinking this on a Sunday morning in an attempt to get over a BIG Saturday night, but seeing as that happens to me about once every five years these days, basically I'm never gonna drink this again! Might serve a purpose for those at LEAST 10 years younger than me!
Interesting marketing since half of the can is in Spanish. I am guessing this is a big hit in the Hispanic community, which clearly is a HUGE, growing demographic in the USA in 2007.
Clearly NOT beer, but then again, is Bud Light on its own?!?!?"
"Anheuser-Busch, Inc.",Bare Knuckle Stout,,,Irish Dry Stout,?,on-tap,1.83,3.5,1.5,2,1.5,1.5,11/24/2007,"Oh dear, oh dear, of dear. I like to give AB the benefit of the doubt when I can, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to do so. Taco Mac, Douglasville. GA, USA - 16oz ""pint"".
Frankly the pour is pretty decent; leaves a fairly standard nitro stout-like pour, with a small, perfectly formed head. Good black body - essentially OK. Smell and taste leave an odd fishy/acidic combo. All very poor.
Thin beyond thin. It's almost impossible to imagine a stout with less body and taste. As my Dad woluld have said, ""as weak as water"".
Lacklustre is not the word. This is a ""beer"" that owes as much to the ""stout"" moniker as does Bud light - a HORRIBLE interpretation of the stlye. Makes USA ased Guninness look AMAZING. Weak, weak, weak."
Saint Louis Brewery / Schlafly Tap Room,Schlafly Saison,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,6.20%,bottle,4.18,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,11/24/2007,"Thanks go out to Vancer for the opportunity to try this as part of CEO/Old Farts BIF. Schlafly is a brewer that is hit and miss with me; sometimes decent, often average and from time to time even below average. I was delighted to find that this was one of their better efforts in my book.
12oz single bottle, bottled (apparently WITH LOVE) on Aug 17 2007.
Dark, butterscotch colored pour with some good carbonation. Nice, pillow-like, dense head with some nice rings of lace. Yeast dregs fall out of the botle when fully inverted to leave a toffee like small, sticky mass on top of the huge head. Looks super!
Good funk in the nose with a touch of sweetened apple cider. Highly drinkable becasue of the smooth mouthfeel and the very, very light citrus notes in the taste. Mild tartness, plenty of hard winter fruits (quince, a little cooking apples) and some Belgian yeast character.
Very well put together, I paired this with some aged cheddar (at least what passes for aged cheddar in the USA!) and a few wheat based crackers. Worked incredibly well together, and excellent combo.
One of the best offerings from this brewer, I really enjoyed this beer."
Allagash Brewing Company,Allagash Fluxus 2007,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,10.00%,on-tap,4.25,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,11/23/2007,"On tap at the Brick Store, Decatur, GA, USA.
Small serving in a goblet. Hazed, orange pour with a huge head and plenty of great lace. Very good carbonation. Looks super.
Belgian base (yeast and sugar) but a significant level of herbal notes. Grassy hop feel and significant organic feel. This really takes the edge off the sugar and sweet notes.
Certainly Belgian, Strong and Pale, but at the same time NOT typically Belgian Strong Pale! Less sugar sweetness, and a far more savory angle on this than expected. Mild white pepper, but not the level of some others in the style. Organic, almost Saison like feel comes through.
Interesting, not typical but clearly a top quality brew."
Chiltern Brewery,Beechwood Bitter,,,English Pale Ale,4.30%,cask,3.85,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,11/23/2007,"Served out of a polypin - notes taken from England trip, July 2007 - Cheers Chris!



Pours like a typical English cask, even from the polypin. Bubbles rather than head. Dark brown pour, carbonation very light. Simple brew that has a little nut character which makes it drink a little more like a brown ale than I was expecting. Mouthfeel is simple.



Good malts, sweet up front, with the mild hop character reserved for the finish. Well balanced. A little toffee and acaramel note - not huge.



The name of this beer is taken from the Beech trees that are prominent in the Chiltern area."
Chiltern Brewery,Three Hundred Year Old Ale/Battle Of Britain Ale,,,Old Ale,5.00%,bottle,3.8,4,3.5,4,3,4,11/23/2007,"Notes taken from England trip, July 2007 - thanks Chris! Sometimes appears as 300 Year Old Ale, sometimes as Battle of Britain Ale.



NIce, mid-dark brown pour with a creamy head and nice lace. Good caramel notes with some light nut. Mouthfeel is average. Dry fruits, hop finish.



I don't think that this is very well described as an Old Ale at all. Lacks the true sweetness and heaviness required for that style. As such this might be better described as an ESB. This didn't take away my enjoyment, I just thought it was a little misplaced in terms of style.



IN short, a nice simple, English bitter."
Chiltern Brewery,John Hampden's Ale,,,Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB),4.80%,bottle,4.05,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,11/23/2007,"Taken from notes from England July 2007 - Cheers Chris!



Bronze body with a head that disappears quickly. Ring of lace in 360o around the edge of the surface. Some minimal lace.



Simple beer but solid. Simple malts up front with mild, citrus hops. Light and drinkable. Lemon/orange notes. Mild fruits and uncomplicated, I found this very easy to drink during a muggy, English summer evening. Sessionable certainly, with plenty of biscuity malt present to satisfy. A little floral note in the nose too."
Chiltern Brewery,Lord Lieutenant's Ale (Porter),,,English Porter,6.00%,bottle,4.28,4,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,11/23/2007,"500 mL bottle, this beer is sometimes called ""Ale"" rather than ""Porter"". Taken from notes from England July 2007, cheers Chris!



Not really a Porter in the truest sense of the style. A little thin and not really ""stout-like"" at all. Reminds me more of an ESB or perhaps a lower ABV Old Ale than a Porter.



Dark Chestnut Brown pour with a splendid looking color body - rich appearance. Small head, some creamy lace.



The mouthfeel is a little lighter than the color and appearance would suggest. Dry and bitter with a hint of smoke - not much, but it is there. Very malty initially, but finishes a little hoppier than I would expect.



Satisfying in terms of taste, if not in terms of body. Very tasty, but lacking something."
Nøgne Ø - Det Kompromissløse Bryggeri A/S,God Jul,,,English Porter,8.50%,bottle,4.65,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,11/23/2007,"$6.99 from Brawley's, Charlotte, NC, USA. 500 mL bottle. Attractive label with the words ""God Jul"" replaced with ""Winter Ale"". Expecting this to make it to GA eventually, but I thought I should snag it in NC - just in case. Very impressed with the Nogne offerings so far, this was no exception.
Pour into the 16 oz American ""pint"" glass is dark brown with a creamy head and some lace. Decent carbonation, but the body is a little murky. Roasted, malts in the nose, with a tinge of smoke. 
Gosh, this is good. Lots of cream in taste. Very mild roasted bitterness, a tiny bit of alcohol but a perfect Porter character. Alcohol is there in the finish too, but it is very light. Mild chocoalte notes (I actually tried this with a Belgian truffle and it just about blew me away). WOW! Considering the alcohol and the style, this is amazingly drinkable.
Another great offering from this brewer, and a delcious combination of Porter and light (if it is possible), American chocolate Double Stout. Nowhere near as heavy as the Stateside version, but this manages to capture all the best aspects. Very, very good."
"Marston, Thompson & Evershed, Plc.",Double Drop,,,English Bitter,5.00%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,11/22/2007,"Taken from notes from England, July 2007. Cheers Chris!
Dark golden colored pour from the clear 500 mL bottle. Wispy, bubbly head, some creamy lace. Looks nice.
Sweet malts dominate this typically English brew, with a small hop presence in the finish. Dry and sweet at the same time. Bitterness is more in the nose rather than the taste. A little caramel and toffee come through, with the classic shortbread and biscuity based malts.
Very drinkable. Won't be everyone's cup of tea, but I could easily turn this into a ""sessionable"" brew (without it being a session beer of course). Lovely stuff. Probably doesn't travel all that well."
O'Fallon Brewery,Pumpkin Ale,,,Pumpkin Ale,5.50%,bottle,2.4,3.5,2,2.5,3,2,11/22/2007,"As part of Old Farts/CEO BIF - thanks to Vancer. 12oz single.
Being Thanksgiving, I thought it was time to clear out the remainder of the Pumpkin and O'Fest brews.
Very pale orange pour, little or no lace, but some head as long as there is aggression in the pour.
Some pumpkin notes but muted. Seems a little acidic and the alcohol comes through too strong for my liking. Pumpkin taste is a little off. Doesn't seem fresh, almost a bit musty. Perhaps I should have grabbed this earlier.
Not a very impressive beer."

Looks good. Golden pour with plenty of carbonation, good clarity, small head and some excellent lace.
Quite sweet nose and initial tastes with some grain. Sharp and refreshing. Malts are prominent and real tasty. Finishes pretty dry. Enjoyable. Grassy hop notes too.
Obviously I approached this with a little tredipation, but with an open mind I was happy that I did. Pretty tasty and I might even try this one again in the future."
"Marston, Thompson & Evershed, Plc.",Old Empire,,,English India Pale Ale (IPA),5.70%,bottle,3.6,4.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,11/21/2007,"From notes taken in England in July 2007. Cheers Chris!
500 mL, splendid looking clear glass bottle.
Quite why this is listed as an American IPA I'm not sure, but I know that subject can get people all excited (What was the original IPA? Where does the modern IPA sit? What about Burton? What about DIPA's? What about subtlety? etc. etc.) so I think I leave that alone here.
Pale orange pour, nice soapy head. Soapy notes in the nose and initial tastes. Apparently the hopping process uses the additional whack of Cascade in the later stages, and these come through a little strong for my liking, somewhat overwhelming the malt and the other (Goldings and Fuggles) hops. Maybe I've answered my own, initial question, and it's the use of Cascade that puts this into an American IPA category.
Bitterness lingers in the finish, and at nearly 6% this beer is a little less traditional than some, similar efforts. A little thin I feel, and this tends to lead to a little lack of satisfaction.
I dunno, not completely sold or sure about this beer, I think I need to come back to it a few times. Lucky me!"
St. Peter's Brewery Co Ltd,St. Peter's Ruby Red Ale,,,English Bitter,4.30%,bottle,4.43,4,4,4.5,4,5,11/21/2007,"From notes taken in July of 2007 in England. Cheers Chris!
Pour reveals a really quite dark body with a small, but dense ad creamy head. Spotty head (again creamy), some lace. Interesting beer that combines a number of attributes; creaminess of a Porter, a little spice that is reminiscent of a Winter Warmer (that apparently comes from the Goldings), and the classic biscuit malt subtlety that you would expect from a typical, simple but well made English bitter.
Extraordinarily drinkable, a delicious brew. Haven't seen it in the USA, we need it here!"
St. Peter's Brewery Co Ltd,St. Peter's Organic Ale,,,English Pale Ale,4.50%,bottle,3.25,4,3.5,3,3,3.5,11/21/2007,"From notes taken in England in July 2007. Cheers Chris!
Very delicate brew that is fairly consistent with the English Pale Ale style that it claims to be in. Plenty of citrus notes fill both the nose and the palate, along with some prickly carbonation - rather too much for my liking.
This is an exceptionally ""light"" beer, and IMO it suffers a little becasue of it. A tad watery, I think the lack of body is the main fault. Lots of sweetness (that I like) and a very clean feeling brew.
Women tend to like this, and it is very easy drinking and good as a summer quencher, but ultimately this left me wanting more and not satisfied."
Unibroue,La Seigneuriale,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,7.50%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,11/21/2007,"Purchased on a recent trip to Greensboro, NC, USA. 750 mL Corked & Caged. Subsequently at Mac's Midtown, Atlanta, GA, USA on sale for $3.99. Typical Unibroue presentation.
Poured into the Duvel tulip this beer has a dark orange body (peach/tea like) with superb lace and a decent, smallish head. Carbonation is good, no doubt helped by the Duvel glass. Fine bubbles form on the surface.
A big, wine-like grape taste up front. Persistent bitterness with some pepper, and a noticeable lack of candied Belgian sugar. Not sweet at all. Finishes yeasty, with some orange peel and some lemon notes; a little more pepper and some light-burn alcohol. Definitely from the savory side of the Belgian Pale family rather than the sweet. Dry finish too.
Lack of sweetness makes this a pleasant change of pace. Many Unibroue beers can be difficult to truly distinguish between, but this one stands out for me. Definitely one of their more distinguishable offerings."
Otter Creek Brewing / Wolaver's,Otter Kilter (Otter Creek World Tour),,,Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy,?,bottle,3.73,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,11/20/2007,"Picked this up on a recent trip to Charlotte, SC at the Home Economist. $4.29 I think. 22oz bomber.
Good looking pour as expected, with a rich, tea colored body, nice initial head and some good carbonation. Head and lace are minimal.
Obviously a lot of malty richness in line with the style (plenty of buttered bread), but a real alchol twang in there too. Tasty. Finishes with a little sharp alcohol as well. A small amount of grapefruit in the finish. Residual sweetness lingers a little with caramel and brown sugar working against the mild citrus bitterness.
A nice example of the style in my book, well worth a try."
Red Oak Brewery,Red Oak Amber,,,American Amber / Red Lager,5.00%,on-tap,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,11/20/2007,"Had this on tap twice on a recent visit to Greensboro, NC - once in Old Town, and once at Smokey Bones.
Pretty simple and drinkable brew that lacks the dry bite of a true amber/red, but certainly has more taste than a simple pale ale. Drinks above the 3.8% advertised. Nice looking red body with a rather small head. Good lace that belies the lack of head. Plenty of simple malts and a sweet bread character that defines this beer. Tasty finish, but lacks the dry character that I would expect for the style as well as much hop profile.
All in all a decent option locally, especially fresh and on tap, but after a while would probably not excite much."
Barrel House Brewing Company,Duveneck Dortmunder,,,Dortmunder / Export Lager,4.20%,bottle,2.15,2,2.5,2,2.5,2,11/18/2007,"$3.99 for the 22oz bomber at Cheers in Carrollton, GA, USA.
Second beer from this brewer, both have been equally unimpressive. Pour has plenty of head and lace initially, but this fades quickly. Murky, turbid, hazy unfiltered look. Yellowish tinge; has the appearance of a wheat. Not good at all.
Mild acidity is the overwhelming experience. Thin in the mouth too; harsh and prickly, no smoothness.
Very low drinkability. 0 for 2 from Barrel House as far as I am concerned."
Brasserie Caulier,Bon Secours - Biere Vivante,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,8.00%,bottle,4.15,4.5,4,4.5,3,4,11/18/2007,"Extremely interesting on a number of fronts;

Notched rear label that seems to indicate ""Lot B"", but the ""Best Before"" notches fall EXACTLY between the months 02/03 and the years 06/07. I suspect this is supposed to be March '07, but either way this beer is STILL drinking nicely. Surprised to see it ""Retired"" here - what's the story?
More surprises becasue this pours as a Belgian Strong PALE, not a dark. Oh well, interesting times!
Corked & Caged 750 mL, very different to the BA db picture! More questions.
Pouring into the Duvel tulip leads to a very, very good looking beer. HUGE head, fantastic lace and deep, deep golden body. Some small, dark floaties at the bottom of the glass (yeast particles?)
Nose matches the taste. A LOT of sherry, maderia type tastes which are delicious. Finishes a little dry, but the alcohol comes through and supports the dry bitter finish well. Almost Champagne like. Maybe a little thin for the style, but this drinks superbly (even at this advanced age). A little dry spice in the finish too. If anything it seems a little HIGHER than 8%. A touch of yeast and candy sugar. Some minor pepper.
One tasty, drinkable beer but I still have lots and lots of questions! This is certainly Pale so why Dark in the BA db?; Why Retired?; Why only 9 reviews?; Why a different presentation to the BA db? etc.
Good stuff!"
Goose Island Beer Co.,Summertime (German Style Kölsch Bier),,,Kölsch,5.00%,bottle,3.1,3,3,3,3,3.5,11/12/2007,"Thanks to Vancer as part of CEO/Old Farts BIF. 12oz single bottle.
Poured into the Tucher Weizen, 0.5L glass.
Pale golden body, distinct lack of head, carbonation and lace despite an aggressive pour. Cloudiness present. Extremely mild beer - very little hop profile; rather bland. Some sweetness, but also muted. The style is obviously a subtle one, but this seems to be especially bland. Very light soap; very light citrus.
Best when very cold, a summer quencher and no more."
Barons Brewing Company,Black Wattle Superior Wattle Seed Ale,,,Herbed / Spiced Beer,5.80%,bottle,3.75,3,3.5,4,3,4,11/11/2007,"12 oz single, Tower on Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA.
I have no idea what Wattle seeds are, but this seems to work very well. Lovely amber clarity on the pour. Some carbonation - it's a shame that the head and lace are so poor. Definitely marked down for the lack of retention.
Has the nose and taste of a malty, nutty Brown Ale. Very tasty, moreish and drinkable. Smooth but lacks presence for me.
A little bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is a little thin for the kind of beer that it is.
Needs a touch more depth IMO."
Coors Brewing Company,Blue Moon Winter Abbey Ale,,,Dubbel,5.60%,bottle,3.03,4.5,2.5,3,2.5,3.5,11/11/2007,"I HAVE DELIBERATELY MOVED THIS REVIEW TO THIS NEW LISTING (from the old Blue Moon Winter Ale), because I *think* that this is a NEW recipe for 2007 and should be listed separately. Maybe this is an error, but for now I think this is the right thing to do. If it IS correctly listed as a new beer, then other 2007 reviews of Blue Moon Winter should be moved here too;
See this thread; http://beeradvocate.com/forum/read/1140400
2007 release, now called Full Moon (as opposed to Blue Moon Winter Ale). 12 oz single from Tower on Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Pour is excellent with a superb head and very good lace. Nice carbonation and a clear, golden body - looks good. Hardly any discernable aroma - not good or bad!
Some taste, but really rather thin in the mouth. Candy sugar sweetness that goes down easy with some kind of yeasty/spice in the finish, but this brew lacks any kind of depth. Very superficial - great looking, but immediately disappoints."
Harpoon Brewery,Harpoon Glacier Harvest Wet Hop Beer (100 Barrel Series #20),,,American Pale Ale (APA),6.70%,bottle,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,11/11/2007,"Thanks to Brewfan for a chance to try this. 22oz bomber, gold foiled top. 
Surprised at the simplicity of this beer considering it is part of the 100 series. Not that that it is a bad thing; in fact it's refreshing, but I did not expect such a brew as part of this series of beers. 
Anyway - pours a light amber color with a decent head and some pretty good lace. Touch of alcohol in the nose, but also some sweet grains - simple.
Mouthfeel is a little viscous (slight syrup), again surprising considering the (relatively) low ABV. Good balance between the hop bitterness (mild) and the sugary malts. Easy drinking, the beer is a little devoid of character, as if it is neither big or small. Strange. It falls between a low, sessionable potential and something more substantial."
Brouwerij Rodenbach N.V.,Rodenbach Grand Cru,,,Flanders Red Ale,6.00%,bottle,1.98,2,1,2.5,2.5,1.5,11/10/2007,"750 mL, $6.99, Corked & Caged, thick gold foil on the neck. Poured into a large wine glass. No lace, and a spotty head that looks like patchy mold on the surface of the beer. Nasty looking, murky brown body.
Pop is absent on opening. Nasty, nasty ethanoic acid, sinus-clearing, eye-watering aroma. Reminds me of red cooking vinegar. Overwhelming acid that does not let up. Gets even sharper in the finish. As the ""beer"" warms the edge is taken off, but this is still a beer that I cannot access.
This becomes sufficiently far enough away from beer to make it ""not"" beer for me. No point in drinking this for me.
Drain pour."
Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Grotten Brown (Pierre Celis Signature),,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,6.70%,bottle,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,11/10/2007,"$6.99, Tower on Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA. Poured into the Abbaye du Val Dieu chalice.
Mid brown/orange body with plenty of carbonation. Slight murkiness. Lots of fine bubbles form a thin film on the surface and the lace is very labile.
Dark grape skins and other yeasty, semi-sweet fruits present. Hop bitterness is apparent up front and the sweetness and malts are definitely muted. Carbonation livens up in the mouth to create a full feel. Finishes quite bitter, with a hint of burned molasses.
Quite a bitter offering that would no doubt mellow with time. Typical Belgian characteristics of candied sugar and yeasty are not big (although the yeast is there). 
Not bad, just a little young yet I feel."
Ridgeway Brewing,Santa's Butt,,,English Porter,6.00%,bottle,2.6,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,11/10/2007,"500 mL bottle, F09 193. Quite an aggressive looking Santa on the label. $4.99 or $5.99 from Smyrna World of Beverage, Smyrna, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Flat Cola appearance. Over carbonated initially in the pour, but strangely enough no head or lace. Body is WAY too light for the style. Disappointing. Drinks like a pretty average Brown Ale. Thin.
Dryish finish and with some alcohol in the nose. A bit chalky. Described as a ""Winter Porter"" whatever that is, this fails on a number of fronts. I dunno - unimpressive."
Mikkeller,Stateside IPA,,,American IPA,7.00%,bottle,4.53,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,11/9/2007,"16.9oz bottle, Green's, Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Overall, very, very tasty.
Light orange pour, with (at first) what seems a high level of carbonation. After a few minutes of warming, this levels out to leave a very attractive sticky head and lace which is more reminiscent of a West Coast IPA. 
Mouthfeel is very, very light. Lots and lots of fruit in the initial tastes which eventually catches up to a hoppy finish, but nevertheless the large fruitiness is the key here. I like it a lot, but to classify this as a big, West Coast American IPA is not really an accurate description - a twist on that, then OK I would agree. I would think of this as a Lite, West Coast IPA (is that possible?)
Plenty of soapiness in the finish after the sugary, grapefruit/orange citrus base.
Really nice. VERY drinkable."
Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Christmas Ale,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,10.00%,bottle,3.53,3,4,3.5,3,3.5,11/4/2007,"Corked & Caged, 750 mL bottle. Green's on Ponce, $8.99. Poured into the Abbaye du Val-Dieu chalice. Big pop on the opening with the foam threatening to come out and some decent gunsmoke.
Unimpressive color - the horrid, Dubbel, murky brown mess (I really dislike that color/appearance). Nice, creamy head on the top of the beer with a little lace. Some floaties in the body of the brew. 
Carbonation is high, a little prickly and a little annoying. Good yeast and fruit notes in the nose. Typical for the style and good. A little alcohol too. Maybe some light apples as well.
Tastes are alcohol based with some dark fig and raisin like fruit notes, but is a bit overwhelmed by the bitter notes in the finish. In fact the hop profile and the alcohol are both too high for my liking (at least at this young age). Maybe the hop bitterness that I perceive is actually a spice based bitterness, but to be honest it still has an adverse effect on the beer. This needs to mellow out a little I think.
Having said all of that, this is still a tasty beer, and a classy one, but it is one of the weaker ones in the St. Bernardus stable. I guess laying a few down would be an interesting experiment. It seems a bit edgy (young)."
Founders Brewing Company,Founders Imperial Stout,,,Russian Imperial Stout,10.50%,bottle,4.33,5,4,4.5,4.5,4,11/4/2007,"Thanks to Hoppymeal for the trade.
Ink black pour with a similar viscosity. Tiny ring of head around the outer extremeties, virtually no lace. It sits there looking menacing!
Alcohol, roasted malts and chocolate in the nose.
A high density RIS with a lot of dark (plain) chocolate character. Bourneville in a glass. Alcohol is present and warming but not burning. Coats the mouth, extremely smooth. Light bitterness and more alcohol complete the package in the finish."
Brouwerij De Dolle Brouwers,De Dolle Dulle Teve (Mad Bitch),,,Tripel,10.00%,on-tap,4.78,4.5,4,5,5,5,11/3/2007,"On tap at the Brick Store, Decatur, GA, USA.
Small serving in a goblet/wine glass. Appearance is a lemon/mustard yellow, clouded with a small ring of head and lace that is persistent. Nice lace.
Nice yeasty aromas with plenty of sweet herb like smells.
The taste of this beer is quite extraordinary. Not only does the beer literally burst into the mouth with candied sugary sweetness, herb like spices, alcohol, yeasty character and smooth mouthfeel, it lingers and continues to cause sensation well after the beer has been swallowed. Amazing!
Drinkability is exceptional and the relative scarcity of this beer on tap makes this a special opportunity. Thanks Dave - superb."
Highland Brewing,Highland Imperial Kashmir IPA,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,10.20%,bottle,3.73,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,11/3/2007,"Shared with Dave and a few others at The Brick Store, Decatur, GA, USA.
Standard DIPA pour from the bottle, with a good head, retention and lace. Body is a little murky. Good balance in the nose and taste with plenty of solid malt backbone to hold the aggressive hops together. Alcohol burns a little in the finish. Plenty of grapefruit.
A standard good offering, but I'm getting a little tired of these bog-standard, non-subtle beers that need more attention to detail that is being hidden here by big everything."
Shmaltz Brewing Company (He'Brew),He'Brew Jewbelation 11,,,American Strong Ale,11.00%,bottle,4.33,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,11/3/2007,"Green's on Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA. 22 oz bomber. The usual He'Brew style label. 
Dark, dark brown pour with a little light entering at the bottom of the Imperial pint glass. A dark brown hue is still present at the bottom of the body. Nice mocha like head with plenty of lace. Good looker.
I wasn't sure what style to expect, other than what I already knew about He'Brew. I have been impressed by their other, malty, sweet big beers and this was no exception. The description as an American Brown Ale is a good one, but I think I might add the ""Imperial"" moniker too! In general I am not crazy about hyped up, American Brown Ales, but this is one of the few that hits the spot nicely.
Alcohol up front, with some brown sugar and malts in the nose. Hops cut in quickly on the initial tastes along with plenty of burned character. Alcohol hangs in there to leave you in no doubt that this is a big beer. Coffee, caramel and burned molasses come through in a rich but balanced combo. I like it!
Mouthfeel is light, despite the fact that there is a little stout-like character that cuts in at the finish.
Wow. A BIG beer with lots of character that walks a fine line, but for me just about pulls it off. This is a close one, as in general I am not a fan of huge ""Brown Ales"", but this hits the spot. It would be worth laying a few of these down."
Southampton Publick House,Southampton Abbot 12,,,Quadrupel (Quad),10.50%,bottle,3.4,2.5,3.5,3.5,4,3,11/3/2007,"Thanks go out to Brewfan for this one. I've been waiting on this one for a while, and perhaps I have built it up a little too much in my mind!
750 mL, Corked & Caged affair. Different bottle style and new label in 2007.
Pour is a little disappointing. Noisy, soda like carbonation that fades quickly to almost nothing. Dubbel, drab color in the body - a little murky. Not great looking at all.
Nose has the requisite Belgian yeasts and candy, as does the taste, BUT the beer is way too sweet for the style, and is even getting close to too sweet for me to enjoy. That is saying something since I really enjoy both the Quads/BSDA and other sweet beers. This one seems as if the fermentation has not been completed and the sugar has not been converted completely to alcohol, i.e. incomplete attenuation. Some spice notes but they are overwhelmed by the sweetness.
Bit of a disappointment, but I would like to try again."
Victory Brewing Company,Braumeister Harvest Pils,,,German Pilsener,6.10%,on-tap,3.7,3,3,4,3.5,4,11/3/2007,"On tap at the Brick Store, Decatur, GA, USA. Served in a Prima Pils glass.
Slightly cloudy, yellow body lacking the super-clarity associated with the style. Small head and a disappointing lack of retention and lace. Apperance is not the strength of this brew.
Tastes are really quite sweet. A lot of malts sits on top of a mild hop finish. Very easy to drink, I'd have to put this in the ""summer quencher"" category. As I got down to the bottom of the glass it began to lose some life - a little flat.
Interesting beer that for me, sits outside of the regular Pils category and strays into (almost) a wheat like brew. Sweetness was the overwhelming sensation for me. Good."
Goose Island Beer Co.,312 Urban Wheat,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,4.20%,bottle,2.35,4,2,2,3.5,2.5,11/2/2007,"From Vancer as part of CEO BIF. 12 oz bottle.
Poured aggressively into the Tucher Weizen glass. Good looker - pale banana yellow body and the classic, Hefe/Weizen-like head.
Apart from the look (which I think is good) this is an amazingly non-descript beer. To call it bland is an understatement. Now, without question some of this is down to the style (that I have never been able to fathom), but even so this beer is just plain uninteresting. It's not bad, but it's just got no character.
A lack of hop bite, not much body and little else to distinguish it. An odd beer."
Stone Brewing Co.,Oaked Arrogant Bastard Ale,,,American Strong Ale,7.20%,bottle,4.03,4.5,4,4,4,4,11/2/2007,"Combined review of two, 12oz bottles that I recieved from both Hoppymeal and Brewfan in seperate trades. Thanks guys.
Initially I have to say that I am a bit confused by this beer. Frankly I hardly get any ""oaked"" character at all. I guess that there is a very slight vanilla note in there, but without knowing I was drinking this beer I'm not at all sure I would have noticed it. This seems largely like a regular AB to me. If there is one significant difference it's the lack of sweetness that I get from the original AB.
Pour is superb. Beautiful garnet color, good carbonation, head is a super, ivory dense affair and the lace is nice. Good looking beer. Nose is hop based, but seems balanced. Similar with the taste. VERY light vanilla notes, but outside of that it's simple a bitter, hop based West Coast bomb.
I like this beer, but I think that's simply because I like AB, not because this is a sigificantly different brew from the original."
Stone Coast Brewing Co.,Knuckleball Bock,,,Bock,5.00%,bottle,3.13,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,11/1/2007,"Thanks go out to Brewfan for this an an ""extra"" in a recent trade.
Great clarity on the pour with an atractive garnet hue. A small spotty, creamy head is formed after the initial pour. Minimal lace. Appearance may be the strongest point of this beer.
Caramel malts with a thinnish body dominate this beer. Simple, clean and refreshing, but certainly lacks depth. Some dry character to the ending. A non-offensive, easy drinking offering but nothing to write home about."
"Bell's Brewery, Inc.",Bell's Octoberfest Beer,,,Märzen / Oktoberfest,5.50%,bottle,3.63,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,10/28/2007,"12oz bottle, thanks to Hoppymeal for the ""extra"" in a recent trade.
Very simple and solid beer. Great clarity with some good carbonation. Orange color, looks good. Small head; some retention and lace. Color is a high-point/strength of this beer.
Typical Oktoberfest feel. Sweet malts, with a hoppy finish to balance the beer. Nevertheless, sweet malts are the order of the day.
A little drier in the finish than one finds in many similar beers. Solid and simple."
Brouwerij Sterkens N.V.,Sterkens Dubbel Ale,,,Dubbel,?,bottle,2.18,1.5,2.5,2,3,2,10/28/2007,"11.2 oz single from Total Wine in Kennesaw, GA, USA. As usual, a horrible looking pour. Nasty, old dishwater color, no head, lifeless look and tobacco like floaties. Yuk.
Aroma has some yeasty sweetness, but not much else.
Tastes are better than the vision would suggest - just. Very light in the mouth = lacks body (apart from the nasty looking floaties), slight plastic influence (the kind I associate with dirty draught lines) and a mildly acidic finish.
At the best of times I am not a huge fan of Dubbels and this is not exception. Ugly looking and rather bland. Poor - not one I would bother with again."
Southampton Publick House,Southampton Grand Cru,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,9.50%,bottle,4.65,4,4,5,4,5,10/28/2007,"Thanks go out to Brewfan for this in a recent trade. I've been waiting on this one for a while. Corked & Caged 750 mL bottle. Part of the ""750 series"".
Not much pop on release of the cork - has me a little worried. Pour is a real, golden/orange pour with very little lace or head, but with a thin film of carbonation on the surface of the beer. Maybe a touch more carbonation would be nice.
Nose has a mild spice with some whisky like alcohol smells.
Tastes are superb. Pretty much exactly what I expected. The orange peel and the spice come through beautifully and the mild alcohol warmth combines the whole package together nicely. Mild liquor like finish too - like a Drambuie or a touch of single malt.
Drinkability is off the charts for me. I look up and most of the bottle has gone! Gulp!
One of my favorite styles from one of my favorite breweries - not a bad combo!"
Avery Brewing Company,Avery Anniversary Ale - Ten,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,10.00%,bottle,4.13,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,10/27/2007,"Thanks go out to Hoppymeal for the trade. Thanks. Apparently $6.99 at the time of purchase. Bottled in 2003. 22 oz bomber, gold foil on the neck.
Cloudy orange, slightly viscous looking body with a small, but rich and soapy looking type head on the surface of the beer. Small amount, but sticky consistency amongst the lace.
This has evolved into a very complex beer. I'm guessing that fresh this was just a typical Double IPA, and that some would say that IS exactly the way it should have been enjoyed. I on the other hand, generally enjoy the way that the fading of the hops profile over time allows the big malts to come through. This certainly has a deep sweetness, with some citric bitterness still present. Probably very different to the original intention but still very nice.
Heavily sugared grapefruit and a touch of aspirin. Finish has a heavy dose of freash/green/grassy organic character."
Cervejaria Sudbrack Ltda,Eisenbahn Vigorosa (Weizenbock),,,Weizenbock,8.00%,bottle,4.15,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,10/27/2007,"Unusual to find this as a single, 12oz bottle in Marietta, GA, USA. Batch #05.
Pour is good looking with a nice, dense bone-white head with some nice lace. Body has a typical Weizenbock color - deep, bright brown with cloudiness from the lack of filtration.
Nose has alcohol and bananas. Smooth, fruity, soft and delicate mouthfeel. Very slight alcohol bite in the finish which is consumate with the style. A tiny bit of bubblegum in the taste, with a touch of clove. Banana and other pulpy fruits lead the way.
Very drinkable, a well put together brew."
Brouwerij Van Honsebrouck N.V.,Kasteel Rouge,,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,8.00%,bottle,4.15,5,4.5,4,4,4,10/26/2007,"I've enjoyed the Kasteel range in the past because they have been realy quite sweet and I enjoy that characteristic, so I thought this would be the same. I was not disappointed.
750 mL bottle, corked & caged from Green's, Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA. $6.99 (I think). Green bottle, with black foil on the neck. Nice looking presentation.
Pour is a truly attracive deep burgandy color with a nice lively head that fades to give a nice thin film on the surface of the beer. A little lace.
To me this beer is all about BLACK cherries. The aroma and the taste are all fairly true to the real thing and to me it strikes a nice balance between sweetness up front and a little tartness in the finish. The finish really seems like the real fruit to me, and the whole (black) cherry package seems genuine rather than artificial. Smooth in the mouth and obviously a very fruity beer. Alcohol is extremely well hidden by the fruit.
I'd imagine that this will be too sweet for some, but I really enjoyed it."
Founders Brewing Company,Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),,,American Double / Imperial Stout,11.20%,bottle,4.48,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,10/26/2007,"12 oz bottle, thanks to Hoppymeal for the trade. Poured into the Val-Dieu chalice the beer is dark brown with a very small mocha head and very little lace.
This looks like a cold coffee and that's very appropriate. Alcohol laced, ice-cold coffee is a simple description. A more complex one would be one that adds vanilla and a touch of bourbon.
Aroma is obviously very coffee-like but there is also considerable alcohol. The alcohol is NOT as prominent in the taste.
Very smooth in the mouth and the beauty is absolutely no bitterness. The lack of coffee-bite is certainly the key to the success of this beer. Brewed very slightly differently this beer could become horribly bitter and difficult to drink (especially considering the ABV). Considering the type of brew and the alcohol this is a VERY drinkable beer. I wouldn't want to drink a lot of it, but the fact that one bottle is so drinkable is a testament to the brilliance of the beer."
North Coast Brewing Co.,Le Merle,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,7.90%,bottle,3.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,10/25/2007,"750 mL, corked & caged bottle, $6.99 from Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Poured into the 500 mL Tucher Weizen glass this looks good. Cloudy honey colored body, good carbonation, great head and retention.
This is certainly sweeter than many traditional Saisons, but still maintains and retains some funk and a little, sweet citrus orange and lime twang. The sweetness is tempered in the finish with quite a large dose of bitterness. I'd even go as far as to say that there is a tiny bit of aspirin in the ending. This is a little like a sweet and sour beer with the sweetness upfront and the biterness a long way in the back end.
Enjoyable, and drinkable. A little out of the style, but still a nice beer. I prefer something like a Saison DuPont in the style, but this beer stands on its own two feet strongly."
Avery Brewing Company,India Pale Ale (IPA),,,American IPA,6.50%,bottle,3.55,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,10/22/2007,"12oz single from Total Wine, Kennesaw, GA, USA.
Pour is great looking with a 1/2 inch dense white head, lovely light orange color, well carbonated and a nice amount of sticky lace. Promises much.
Sweet malts are the initial tastes. These fade to give the hop burst. Fresh and sharp, with a lingering bitter aftertaste that smacks of a little aspirin. I wouldn't call it unbalanced, but I would prefer the malts to linger alongside the persistent bitterness. The finish is a little out of kilter.
Good quality American IPA, that gets a little too aggressive in the ending for me."
Buffalo Bill's Brewery,Buffalo Bill's Pumpkin Ale,,,Pumpkin Ale,5.20%,bottle,1.33,2,1,1.5,1.5,1,10/22/2007,"12oz stubbie single from Total Wine, Kennesaw, GA, USA.
Oh dear, from the get go things are NOT good here. It pours like soda. A very fizzy pour with a ""head"" that disappears almost instantly and dies to leave a cloudy, orange body. No body.
Taste is nasty. Earthy, very earthy and something like a clove infused tea. The pumpkin isn't there for me, but it seems to have been replaced by an all-spice soda. Mouthfeel is weird - fizzy and light, like a diet soda. High carbonation but it's way too raw.
Aroma is a cross between cloves and antisceptic with the emphasis on antisceptic. Nasty.
Worst pumpkin ale I have ever come across and frankly one of the worst beers, period. Drain pour after 1/4 of the bottle."
"Middle Ages Brewing Co., Ltd.",Druid Fluid,,,American Barleywine,9.50%,bottle,3.95,3,4,4,4,4,10/21/2007,"I've had this a few times before, just now getting around to reviewing it. Purchased as a single 12 oz bottle from Tower on Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA.
I suspect that this bottle is fairly old, but it's difficult to tell (no dates as far as I can see) - more of that later.
Pour is a dirty, mid-brown, murky body that is not that attractive. Looks like a Dubbel - I don't like the color or the body appearance at all. Head is very small but still good considering the ABV. No lace to speak of.
Strong liquor, alcohol and sherry notes in the nose. Taste replicates this, especially the sherry. A bit of dry alcohol bitterness in the finish, but the sherry is the winning factor. My guess is that over time (I suspect this bottle is quite old) the sherry notes have developed. I like that. Perhaps some hop profile has declined.
Definite sweetish BW that is taking on more English character rather than American over time. I think it has evolved nicely.
VERY drinkable considering the ABV. Good stuff."
Victory Brewing Company,V-Saison,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,7.50%,bottle,3.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,10/21/2007,"A hazy, honey colored pour from the 750 mL corked & caged bottle that came from Green's on Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA. $7.99.
Head is perfectly formed. Small but dense, not much lace. Light sweetness in the nose.
Mild spice, a little clove and all spice but it is muted. Quite sweet, a touch of citrus. This beers beauty is all in the finish. This is where the acidity and funk settle on the tongue and palate. This part of the beer reminds you that it really IS a Saison. Light and easy drinking, It's soft in the mouth.
I always think that Saison's make good aperitif drinks, and this is no exception."
Lagunitas Brewing Company,Lagunitas Imperial Red Ale,,,American Strong Ale,7.20%,on-tap,4.53,5,4,4.5,4.5,5,10/20/2007,"Quite why I had never bothered to pick this up in Atlanta is totally beyond me, but I suspect that the lack of 22oz bombers (only sixers) of it had something to do with it. Finally got around to trying in on tap at The Brick Store, Decatur, GA, USA.
Superb looking beer. Deep, dark crimson color and perfectly formed head. Looks VERY inviting.
This beer has ALL of the attributes of an American Strong Ale. Great malt presence, delicious hop profile and the two marry together just about perfectly. Slight bitterness from the citrus based piney hops. Alcohol is there but also blends beautifully. Silky mouthfeel top the package off nicely.
Very well put together brew. Simple, balanced and delicious."
BridgePort Brewing Co. / Brewpub + Bakery,Haymaker Extra Pale Ale,,,American Blonde Ale,5.30%,bottle,3.55,3.5,3,3.5,4,4,10/19/2007,"12oz single from Tower on Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Macro lager colored pour with a much better head retention and lace than the similar looking brew. Carbonation is not huge, but is persistent.
A lot of malt character, quite sweet. Despite that it maintains its integrity. Tasty with a very low key, underlying hop character. Smooth, clean and refreshing. 
I enjoyed this. It's VERY simple, but tasty and a nice summer quencher."
Nøgne Ø - Det Kompromissløse Bryggeri A/S,# 100,,,American Barleywine,10.00%,bottle,3.85,4,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,10/19/2007,"Not sure if this is really ""retired"" but it recently turned up at Green's in Atlanta, GA, USA. 1 Pt .9 floz.
Pour is dark, dark brown (almost black) with a creamy cappuccino like head. It doesn't really leave a classic lace, more of a dense, coffee like cream foam on the side of the glass. Reminiscent of the inside of an Italian coffee cup.
Extremely creamy mouthfeel with a distinct (burned) chocolate feel. Sharp and very bitter finish. Bitterness lingers slightly. More stout-like than a Barley Wine (on the label), and certainly not any DIPA character as listed on the BA db. I would say this is more like an Imperial, American Double Stout or perhaps an ""imperialized"", AMERICAN Brown Ale (American because of the bitterness and the hoppy factor).
Not really coffee-like in terms of the taste, but definitely has a coffee-like bitterness.
Interesting, but not really my cup of tea. It falls between the two areas of being malty/creamy and hoppy/bitter and doesn't really pull either off properly. An odd hybrid in my book."

Country Life Brewery,Country Life Country Bumpkin,,,English Strong Ale,6.00%,cask,3.23,3.5,4,3,3,3,10/15/2007,"Beer with a great deal of potential but a little rough around the edges. Had it on a couple of different visits to Devon, but this was in Great Torrington just down the road from the brewery.



Darkish pour with a distinct lack of head. Carbonation was absent but there were some decent reddish hues. Strong certainly, without much subtlety, this beer speaks bitterness and alcohol. Despite this rough approach I really felt as though there were malts fighting to get out and perhaps in another batch you could have a less aggressive experience.



This is still a pretty young brewery, but I think that they are one to watch. A little way away from the finished article just yet, but we'll see in time."

Golden pour with good clarity and nice carbonation. This is a very light beer with some simple and straighforward bitterness and a good malt backbone. Although nothing to write home about, I always look for a brewery to have a couple of beers like this in their stable because they can show off a mastery of the art and a level of consistency that is often missing.



Fresh, grassy and a little floral aroma to the simple hop character.



Refreshing. Best consumed fresh and in the summer methinks."
Red Rock Brewery,Back Beach,,,English Bitter,3.80%,cask,4.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,10/15/2007,"Available in a number of Devon locations, but I drank this on tap at The Firehouse in Exeter, Devon, England. Pat and Don are no longer the owners at the Firehouse (from my days of working there) but the building and the pub were almost identical. Happy to find the old place still looking the same after 15-20 years!
Back Beach was one of three or four cask beers available. I think this is the type of English Bitter that has gained in popularity so much in recent years and is often called a ""Golden Ale"" in the UK. Generally I'm not high on this type of beer.
This poured a light amber with a lively head and plenty of fresh, grassy notes in the nose. VERY refreshing and easy drinking, this struck me as a summertime bitter if ever there was one. Very clean Maris Otter/Goldings and a sharp clean finish too. The finish was reminiscent of a Pils clean bitterness.
This is certainly not a heavy beer by any stretch of the imagination, and to be honest I am generally not keen on these very light bitters but this one seemed to hit the spot. I think the combination of the freshness of the draft pour and the moment (high summer/nostalgia of the setting) may have allowed me to give this a higher score than I otherwise have might. Anyway, I enjoyed this very refreshing and drinkable brew."
St. Austell Brewery,Proper Job,,,English India Pale Ale (IPA),5.50%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,10/15/2007,"The phrase ""Proper Job"" is a Cornish one meaning ""good job"" or ""well done"". My Cornish father would use it all the time when I was growing up. Proper Job the beer, is a relatively strong English IPA.



Plenty of hop character here from the the nose all the way through to the finish. despite this it's a pretty light drinker in the tradition on English IPA's. Some grapefruit in the nose and simple, biscuit malts back up the hop profile. I really go the most from this beer when I drank it when really thirsty. Great thirst quencher.

Exceptional malts are upfront which hold the whole brew together. Perfectly balanced hop profile cuts in, but the sweetness of the malt make this beer for me. Almost honey-like flavor and smoothness, real ambrosia.



Pour is a mid amber color with a good head that is dense and well retained. Lace is superb. To say this beer is easy to drink is the understatement of the year. Before I had even looked up I had drunk three pints of it, and the tases were still coating my palate as I ordered the fourth!



The sweetness was truly difficult to pinpoint, but it no way was it cloying. Almost like a treacle or syrup character that had been toned down.



Absolutely delicious and drinkable beyond imagination."

12 oz bottle as a single from Total Wine.
Great looking orange pour withe super head and retention again. Seems a little sweeter and less ""upfront hoppy"" than some of the earlier vintages but that may be because I am drinking this later in the season than in the past.
Still ahs the aspirin bite in the back end, finish and aftertaste.

This FINALLY makes it to GA. I had just about given up. $10.49 for the 4 pack at Smyrna World Of Beverage, Smyrna, Atlanta, GA, USA. (Also at Arbor Place for $9.99). Having really enjoyed the 2005 (22oz) version, I have been looking forward to it.
12oz bottle is poured into the Sweetwater 420 Pilsner glass. Cloudy golden body with a small but perfectly formed, compact head, great retention and some superb lace. Nose has mild hop character but not a huge amount.
Taste is unique. Almost a mild spice in the mouth, with a liquor like finish. Hop bitterness kicks in with the aftertaste that has more than a touch of metallic character too. A touch of lemon or citrus there as well. This dovetails nicely with a moreish sweetness that kicks in halfway down the bottle. Very smooth and easy drinking. Mouthfeel is slightly viscous and large, you can certainly tell that you are consuming something a little out of the ordinary and special.
Delicious, almost certainly supposed to be consumed fresh, but I wouldn't mind seeing what this does with a little age on it too."

11.2oz pour which is a huge bonus because it avoids the conversation about NOT pouring the beer into a frozen glass!
Very light, orange pour with excellent sticky, white lace. Unfortunately served waaaay too cold so you have to wait for this one to wam up a little. It's a shame theat they keep getting the temperature of these pours wrong at TM because although I don't really mind waiting a bit, after that time lapse, the head and its appearance suffer some. Ho hum.
Tasting notes are pretty identical to my earlier tasing of the bottled version. The alcohol is still amazingly well hidden, and there is a fresh hop sweetness about this beer that makes it one of the easier American DIPA's to quaff - alaraingly so at an ABV approaching 10%.
Everytime I drink this I love it, I would like to think it will become a draft staple in this parts but I doubt it will last. A little to sophisticated for around here with its tiny little glass!"

Pale orange, unfiltered pour with a serious lack of head, lace or retention. Disappointing look. Flat looking.
Nose has some hops but gives a little bown sugar too. The taste is overwhelmingly sweet (even for my taste) and its way out of style in that respect.
Body lacks life. Dead looking brew.

Simple pour with nice clarity but very little life. Not much head and the retention is just not there. Very light lace. Slightly acidic nose with some sweetness.
Some weak malty character and some extra carbonation. A little soda like in the mouth. Pretty typical in terms of taste, but it seems lighter than many.

&#8206;24 oz bottle, the usual presentation. 
&#8206; 
What's this? A SN hop based beer in the classic APA/American IPA style - I've NEVER seen one of those &#8206;before, WHAT a huge departure for SN!! ;-) 
&#8206; 
Anyway, here we go. 
&#8206; 
As usual a great looking copper clarity in the body and some decent head, retention and some sticky &#8206;lace. Carbonation seems a little low, but the body is fine. 
&#8206; 
Grassy, fresh hops in the nose (imagine THAT!), and similar notes in the taste. Little else. Bitterness is &#8206;high but according to style. Malt backbone is there, but obviously in takes a lesser role. Finish is clean &#8206;with more astringent bitterness that lingers a little. 
&#8206; 
What to say? I really have run out of adjectives that distinguish this from UMPTEEN other SN beers. &#8206;Fine, but how this is diffeent from about a dozen other SN beers I fail to see.&#8206;

24 oz ""bomber"", 2007 vintage. $3.49 from Tower, Buford Highway, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Light orange body, good carbonation, HUGE head, nice lace and good general retention. Nice looking brew.
Light body with PLENTY of soapy, soapy hops! Tastes light and fresh. Wet hopped feel. The wet hops are really upfront, and I like the feel that this brings.
Tasty, but it is a rather one-dimensional soapy hop taste. Not bad, but by the end of the bottle it's waring a bit. I guess a couple of bottles each season and I'll be happy."

Not quite sure why this is listed as an American Amber/Red in the BA db since it is called Octoberfest, drinks like a malty Oktoberfest brew and it says on the label that it is Marzen style. On well..
Atractive light orange body that is lively with plenty of carbonation. Large, frothy head with plenty of lace and decent retention.
Ok, what we get here is a nice, malty bread based beer with a suprising hop presence (maybe that is where the Amber moniker comes from). Finishes clean and strong.
An unremarkable brew, but still a strong one. I enjoyed it. It's a *little* different to a standard Oktoberfest/Marzen but I still liked it."

13% ABV - Jeez...
Pour is dark orange with a very thin head and no lace. Not that surprising considering the ABV. Sweet nose and hop based (imagine that!)
Pretty viscous mouthfeel (that is not exactly surprising given the ABV), but a drinkable combination of big hops and big sweetness.
This JUST pulls the combonation off - it's a close call, but considering the combination of bitterness and alcohol this remains an amazingly drinkable beer. I don't think I would want more than one, but at the same time when you consider the whole package, I'm delighted that I CAN manage even one!
Huge hops, equally large sweetness this is a beer that could ONLY be brewed in the USA. In some ways it's totally insane, but it still manages to stay (just, just, just) in the realms of drinkability. This one walks a very fine line, I bet some (non-American especially) BA's will hate it!

Nice pour in terms of the head and retention (real creamy and thick looking). Sticky lace. Color is a dark, burned orange and lacks the clarity I would like to see - a couple of ticks off the appearance score for the cloudy body, otherwise looks super.
Hoppy nose, but it has a large degree of sweetness at the same time. This is a duplicate of the taste. Hops up front, but quickly sweet malts smooth out the beer rapidly. Nice. Creamy, smooth mouthfeel, even as far as to say this drinks like nitro pour! Delicious.
Alcohol and sweetness meld nicely together and the hops although large, are surprisingly not really what I take away from this beer. What I do take is a really creamy, sweet and delicious brew. Drinks well below the ABV - pleasing.

Poured into the Abbaye du Val-Dieu chalice/goblet. Very fizzy pour. Over carboated for the style. Lack of head and lace, although some remains on the surface of the macro, yellow/lager body. Appearance is disappointing considering the style and the cost.
Aroma is a bit like an adjunct lager! Has a mild, Belgian yeast experience but not a lot. Not impressed.
Taste has some sweetness and a little Belgian yeast, but this does not really cut in until the end. Lightweight taste and body for a Belgian Pale, this is a disappointing brew for me. Lacks presence and punch.
Nowhere near as good as the Brune that is also in GA. Frankly I was very disappointed in the total package."

$11.95, paper wrapped bottle, Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA. Capped and corked. Corked look as though it was one of those plastic ones, but I'm afraid I never got to see it - when I attempted to push the corkscrew into it, it fell into the beer! Consequently a pain in the ass to get the beer to pour.
Really disappointed in the appearance. Blood-red cloudiness, but the noisy fizziness of the beer is translated into NO head and NO lace. Poor.
Nose as expected. The taste is also a bit of a disaapointment. I don't get any cherry taste, rather just a persistent sourness (that I was expecting), but a profound lack of real taste (that I was not expecting). Weak tasting brew.
Not a patch on the De Ranke Bitter or the Pere Noel, and worse than some of their other offerings too. I just don't rate (or like) this brew. Disappointing."

Lifeless looking pour with a head that dies away quickly to leave almost nothing on the surface of the beer. No lace. Mid-brown, uninteresting to say the least.
Sweet malts in the nose and some in the taste. Wouldn't guess this was supposed to be an O'fest, it seems like an amber/sweet lager without any distinguishing character.
Utterly bland beer (not offensive, but just blah..). This is a typical ABC beer. Not bad, not good, just there. Completely average in all respects and a beer I doubt I will ever bother again. Misses the boat (opportunity) yet again.

Anyway, lots of sweet malts upfront and a surprisingly tasty banana/bubblegum hit early in the mouth. A little tangy/lively carbonation. Still remains pretty sweet though. Finish is simple with even a little smoke in there??!! Slight banana taste. No bitterness present.

($4.50 for a 16oz pour at Taco Mac, Douglasville, GA, USA but as usual the lines seems less than 100% clean to me).
Seems to be much sweeter on tap (perhaps my imagination) and it moves more toward the Barleywine side of things rather than the Double IPA style of the bottle from last week.

Mid orange pour, small but well retained head with some really nice lace. Carbonation is mild but persistent.
Soapy hop tastes are there upfront and they linger. Citrus character of the hop is definitely there. Malts are there to support the package and they come through in a mild, creamy sweet finish.

Essentially this should be called a ""Sour"" of some description.
Frankly I was really VERY, VERY disappointed. Great head in the Duvel tulip sits on top of a mid-orange body. Not a great deal of lace or retention.
Nose gives away the source of my disappointment. Way too much sourness for a BSPA IMO. Even though the beer was NOT incredibly sour OVERALL, the acidity was sufficient to take it far enough out of the style to annoy me. Plenty of Brett and Lambic character and not much else. Any Belgian yeast character and spice is overwhelmed by the sour character that permeates the whole beer. Not my cup of tea at all.
IMO a pretty poor Belgian Strong Pale with all the sour and tart character. Give me more yeast and typical Belgian candied character please.
On top of all of that, HORRIBLE value for money.

This is a tricky one. From the name I was expecting some kind of Fest/Autumn/spiced brew. In the bottle I got what amounted to an American IPA.
Good color, decent head and some retention amongst the lace. A lot of bitterness for an ESB. Some hint of the classic English malts, but these are eclipsed by a lot of stinging bitterness.
OK, but not really my favorite combination of flavors and certanly not true to my interpretation of the style.

We did it blind, so I had a guess at what I thought it was. I said a 9.00%, Imperial Pils type. That was the closest that I could guess, even though it really lacked any sharp, crisp hop bite that one might expect in that case.
Pour was a typical golden, macro yellow, but the head was large, and well retained.
All I got was a vaguely sweet, slightly bitter smooth beer with some fairly significant alcohol. Went down very well. Initially any Belgian yeast characteristics were lost on me a bit (i.e. I didn't really get any), but as it warmed they came a little more to the fore.
Not bad. pretty drinkable just not too sure about the style label."

Golden/orange pour with great clarity. Plenty of carbonation in the form of fine bubbles racing up from the bottom of the glass. This seems on the spicy side of the Pumpkin Ale spectrum. Nice.

VERY dark pour, almost black with a substantial head. This ""looks"" like a stout. Plenty of roasted malts present, even with some burned character. A little cooking chocolate in there too. Couple that bitterness with an extremely hoppy taste and aroma and you have a beer that drinks with some stout characteristics.
Not really my cup of tea for an American Strong. I prefer the Bastards that seem (as odd as it sounds) to have more balance than a beer like this.
Probably wouldn't bother again with this fresh, but I'd imagine that at least I would like this aged somewhat. I'd like some hops taken off the top, and for the beer to smooth out a little. Many would disagree I suspect, simply because they love the huge hop presence."
SweetWater Brewing Company,Sweetwater Donkey Punch,,,American Barleywine,10.00%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,9/29/2007,"$8.49 from Green's, Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA.
MIGHTY impressive looking bottle - the old flip-top 1 L bottles used for Festive Ale. Homebrewers LOVE these bottles. Gold Foil tops off the package impressively.
Pour is a slightly cloudy mid-brown with a superb head and good retention. Looks OK, but the color is a little drab and lacks a certain ""sparkle""!
Nose is hoppy, but not really over-agressive.
OK, I'm not the style Police, but in no way is this drinking like a BW, American OR English! One or two early comments that I had heard suggested this was a really sweet BW, more in the English style than the American, but for my money this is a typical American DIPA. Good hop presence and a simple but strong enough malt backbone hold it all together nicely.
Drinks well, and the alcohol is VERY well hidden. This is a nicely put together beer, but it does NOT resemble a BW (of either type) to me. It's another solid, American DIPA that is better than some since it doesn't have a HUGE, grating West Coast hop presence. A more subtle American DIPA (if such a thing can exist!)
Worth a try, but don't expect a BW IMO."

Typical Saranac/Matt brew - OK, but ultimately rather ordinary. Light amber/orange pour with a nice initial head but this fades quickly with no lace. Lack of carbonation makes this look a little lifeless.
Pumpkin and spice does manifest itself in the taste and the aroma at the beginning, BUT this drops off very swiftly. It becomes a rather bland (but inoffensive) slightly spiced brew.

First off, a cubed ESB makes no sense at all. I don't know what the brewery is trying to achieve here, but what they end up with is a pretty aggressive, relatively unbalanced, American double IPA.
Pour has a typical DIPA orange/brown hue, with some chill haze. A nice head with some lace and retention. Aroma has a really raw, organic grassy resin to it. Very piney. 
Taste is not all that aggressive in terms of hops, BUT it is extremely bitter. Not well balanced by malts and the package doesn't really come together that well. Not bad, but too raw for my liking. Edgy bitternes without subtlety.
This is not an ESB at all. Perhaps you could put it into the American Strong Ale category, but its malts are a little too weak for that as well. It essentially drinks like a DIPA.
Drinkability is not good - simply to bitter and not well balanced. A beer that needs some work I would say."
Sprecher Brewing Company,Oktoberfest,,,Märzen / Oktoberfest,5.80%,bottle,4,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,9/23/2007,"Thanks go out to Vancer for sending this as part of the CEO/Old Farts BIF. 16oz ""big"" bottle. Label looks ""Germanic""!
Nice appearance. Good clarity, a great orange/amber color with some head and a little lace.
A high quality Fest/Marzen with some delicious toasty, rich malts. Definitely slightly more bitter than some of the same style, but it seems to work well as a change of pace. It lacks a little of the sweetness that I usually seek in the style, but it still comes together nicely. Some nice, subtle malts.
There appears to be some fine carbonation that makes the mouthfeel rather nice too. Even a little creaminess.
Drinkability is certainly high. Tasty, toasty beer!"
Brasserie Val De Sambre,Heylissem Triple Brune,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,9.00%,bottle,4.33,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,9/22/2007,"$8.99 for the 750 mL corked and caged bottle. Best Before 05/09. Macs, Downtown, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Encouraging pop on opening. Poured into the Duvel tulip this forms a large, high head. This falls to give a classic, creamy and spotty film on the surface of the garnet colored body.A lot of sweet caramel in the nose.
Plenty of caramel sweetness in the taste too, which increases with increasing temperature. Very mild spice in the finish. Warming alcohol too. A little tea in there as well. Maybe some brandy notes.
Mouthfeel is medium, but the sweet character amps it up a bit. Some Belgian yeasty character as it warms.
Delicious BSD, this is good value and a substantial beer. All the classic characters are there, a lovely beer."
Warsteiner Brauerei,Warsteiner Premium Oktoberfest,,,Märzen / Oktoberfest,5.90%,bottle,1.53,2,1.5,1.5,1.5,1.5,9/22/2007,"Purchased as a 12 oz single from Total Wine, Kennesaw, GA, USA.
So, it's the season for delicious, malty, full bodied Oktoberfests and some delcious Pumpkin brews. All of them with great color and body and plenty of taste. Then comes this....oh dear.
I don't like Warsteiner beers in general, so I was dubious, but I couldn't resist at least trying it once. Pours with a fizzy macro lager like look, and drinks pretty much like a strong, Euro, macro/adjunct lager. Nasty. Over carbonated fizz, extreme sweetness with a sickly edge that reminds me of a low quality malt liquor. Absolutely no body, and as far as I can tell no Marzen character. Malts are missing, and the body is AWOL.
Oktoberfest? You're joking aren't you??"
Brouwerij De Landtsheer NV,Malheur Bière Brut (Brut Reserve),,,Bière de Champagne / Bière Brut,12.00%,bottle,4.58,5,4,4.5,5,5,9/21/2007,"Thanks to Dave for cracking this one on a Tuesday afternoon at The Brick Store, Decatur, GA, USA for sampling! $24.99 at Green's in the ATL, even more expensive if you are drinking this while out. The usual, impressive, foiled neck, large dimpled, thick walled champagne type bottle.
I happened to have the Noir Brut a few days before, and although I enjoyed it I still thought it was rather poor value for money. This got back to impressing me, and was more reminiscent of the exceptional ""10"".
Pefect, rich but still pale, yellow butterscotch pour with lots of cloudiness. Small head belies the amount of carbonation. Fantastic looker, especially in the ""Babycham"" type Malheur glasses - superb!
Fine bubbles of carbonation hit the mouth initially. Classy. Lots of yeast, and a dry finish. Plenty of champagne like character but still obviously a beer. Coats the mouth in rich, deep malts and yeast without a hint of bitterness. Velvet like.
Delicious, and this gets back to the excitement of the ""10"". truly a great beer for celebrating, or even for cracking open on a Tuesday afternoon! Cheers Dave."
Lagunitas Brewing Company,Hop Stoopid,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,8.00%,on-tap,3.55,3.5,4,3.5,4,3,9/21/2007,"Draught, The Brick Store, Decatur, GA, USA.
Wow. Even by West Coast standards this seemed like a BIG hoppy beast. Pour is a typical cloudy orange with a nice head and some good, sticky lace. After that...well, very little to report except in your face, piney, resinous, mouth coating hops. It's fine but after a while this gets a little wearing. I found that one pint was just about all I wanted. Alcohol is there but is in balance. Also, the finish really was quite ""puckeringly"" dry and not really my cup of tea. I wasn't sure if that was the beer as a package or just my palate's reaction to the hop assault!
Some will love this, but if you are at all wary about massive West Coast hop bombs then this isn't going to be your thing. Steer clear."
Weyerbacher Brewing Co.,Imperial Pumpkin Ale,,,Pumpkin Ale,8.00%,bottle,4.03,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,9/21/2007,"Thanks go out to YonderWanderer for the trade. Cheers!
2007 release, 22 oz bomber, $5.99. Mid copper colored pour with not a great deal of head after the initial aggressive pour, and not much lace or retention. Pretty heavy pumpkin and spice in the nose. Cloudy. Reminds me a bit of Sam Adams Old Fezzy.
Quite sweet with plenty of pumpkin/spice character. Cinnamon and clove come through nicely. 
Mouthfeel is rather light, but quite refreshing. Drinks easily. 
A little warming alcohol in the finish.
Overall a very nice experience. Lacks a huge presence, but the nevertheless very nice. Lovely Autumnal experience."

Mid-brown pour with thin creamy head that disappears pretty quickly (as expected for the ABV). Quad nose, but mellow, not aggressive. Figs, some Maderia?
Typical Quad notes in the taste. Brown sugar, raisins. VERY smooth. At first it seems a little light on the mouthfeel side, but I suspect that this compliments the beer nicely to make it very drinkable. Superb, sherry like aftertaste, and a really creamy finish. Alcohol is nowhere to be seen - superbly hidden, one might even say dangerously so. Not especially ""spicy"" as such, but has a slight Winter Warmer characteristic.
Overall a delightful Belgian Quad with all the right moves. Highly quaffable so you need to take care. Quality."
Wells & Young's Ltd,Wells Banana Bread Beer,,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,5.20%,bottle,4.4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,9/16/2007,"This had been on my Wants list for a long time and I eventually caught up with it on my recent trip home to England. A few weeks after returning from the UK, up it pops in GA! I'm pretty sure this is a new addition to the USA, let alone GA.
Anyway, back to the beer itself. From a substantial 1 pint, 3.25oz bottle with a different, updated label from the one in the BA dB, it pours slightly darker than a macro lager yellow, with a small head, some carbonation and a small ring of retention. Good clarity.
Nose has plenty of over-ripe bananas and some bubble gum. Taste has the same, but with more emphasis on the bubblegum, and with a slightly bitter finish. A mild aspirin in the finish.
Crisp, smooth and refreshing, I like this a lot. Very tasty indeed."
Barrel House Brewing Company,RedLegg Ale,,,American Amber / Red Ale,4.20%,bottle,2.03,2,3.5,1.5,1.5,2,9/15/2007,"$3.99 for the 22oz bomber from Cheers in Carrollton, GA, USA. First time I've seen this in GA, fairly new to the state. Cheers also had the Dortmunder, the 'Dark' Double IPA (whatever that is) and the Hefe all at $3.99. I toyed with the idea of buying all four, but decided that it would be wise to try one first to see if it was up to scratch. Glad I resisted!
Dark orange, cloudy pour, perhaps due to some chill haze but it looks a bit iffy. Carbonation can be described as 'fizzy'. Some head but retention is zero. Decent aroma with some solid malts.
After that things go downhill. WOEFULLY thin in the mouth and we get a thin, mildly acidic, apple influenced, weak brew. Perhaps even going as far to say infected. Not good at all.
In my American Red/Ambers I am looking for clarity, a great amber/red color, good head, nice sticky retention and a solid mouthfeel with plenty of malt/hop balance. This FAILS on all fronts.
Might be a while before I bother with the others."
Brouwerij De Landtsheer NV,Malheur Brut Noir (Black Chocolate),,,Bière de Champagne / Bière Brut,12.00%,bottle,3.68,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,9/15/2007,"$24.99 for the champagne style, foiled, corked & caged 750 mL bottle. Looks mighty impressive. Enjoyed the Malheur 10 immensley so had high hopes for this one.
Good pop on the release of the cork. Pours with a dark brown/reddish color. Plenty of carbonation, but not much head or retention. Some fruity character, but it comes with some real dry character true to the Brut moniker. Alcohol prominent, but not overpowering. Lots of black grape skins and some tannin are evident.
Dry finish with a little alcohol burn.
Nice, drinkable and tasty, but rather poor value. I'd happily pay about half that price, but $25 seems a bit steep for what it is."
Lagunitas Brewing Company,Kill Ugly Radio,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,7.80%,bottle,3.48,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,9/15/2007,"$2.99, 22oz bomber from Green's on Ponce. 
Suprisingly light colored pour. Not a problem, but the beer looks as though it lacks a bit of body. A lot of carbonation, wispy head and not much retention.
Light hops in the nose, not huge. Floral in nature.
Grapefruit and citrus (lemon) flavors are the first ones to hit the palate. Not a great deal else. After the beer warms there is a significant amount of hop bitterness that kicks in. This beer improves with a bit of warmth.
Thirst quencher certainly, but this lacks a bit of depth for me. In fact, really quite light. Summer drinking? Light mouthfeel.
I dunno, this is fine and I enjoyed it, but it seems to be lacking for some reason. Difficult to put my finger on why, but leaves me wanting something else."

Good grief! What happened to this beer? This release is a MESS. Huge alcohol and syrup, the beer is close to undrinkable for me. There seems to have been ramping up of the package that resulted in an offensive high gravity malt liquor. This beer has lost all its subtlety and is now drinking more like Special Brew or a high alcohol malt liquor from the gas station.
Body is thick, alcohol is way too obvious and the slick mouthfeel combined with the sweetness makes it feel like a bad homebrew. VERY disappointing from a brewery with much potential but still not consistent enough for me."

Very cloudy orange pour into the Brasserie des Rocs chalice. Not much head, little lace. Quite a lot of debris in the bottom of the glass once the beer has settled.
Sweet, but light bodied Tripel. Frankly lacks depth. Some yeast character but not much. Residual sweetness again, but rather light. A bit disappointed, I expect more from this stable."

Best before Oct 07 notched on the bottle.
Bright yellow pour, but plenty of haziness about the beer. Some floaties. Aroma has a VERY strong funk and to be honest it seems reasonable to assume that this will be replicated in the taste, but it isn't. Relatively mild horse balnkets, and only a hint of apple cider. A bit of an easier Saison to stomach for the inexperienced. Crossover potential. Alcohol VERY hidden.
A mild and refreshing Saison. Nice beer, another winner in the Heavy Seas collection."

Poured into the Urthel stemmed goblet in small portions, this is black pour but does have a few dark brown notes too. Mocha head with a coffee feel. Head is spotty but lace is fairly scant. 
Chocolate malts and dark chocolate bitterness are the keys here - not much else. The wheat doesn't make much of an appearance for me, except perhaps in the mouthfeel which is very light for this type of beer. As a RIS this is not a superb example, BUT it certainly is a tasty brew. The only thing that lets it down is the texture, which although the word ""thin"" would be a stretch, certainly leaves a little to be desired.
An interesting experiment with wheat that works OK, but not really as a classic RIS. Nevertheless a nice beer and I enjoyed it."

Poured into the Tucher Weizen glass this shows a slightly darker, golden colored pour with a smaller than average head and some floaties of some description. Not the best looking Hefe I have seen.
Nose and tastes still have the banana, clove and bubble-gum combo, with the emphasis on the banana here. Not huge.
OK, decent, but I won't buy this again. Plenty of other better options out there."
North Coast Brewing Co.,ACME California IPA,,,American IPA,6.50%,bottle,3.15,3,2.5,3,3.5,4,9/3/2007,"Listed on the bottle as 6.5%. Yellowy/Orange pour that is very cloudy. Looks like a good West Country Scrumpy! Tall, white head that looks pillow like from above, but on the side it appears to made up of much bigger diameter bubbles. Falls away quickly with not much lace to speak of. Carbonation seems a little high.
Aroma is very muted, not much to speak of at all. Tastes are hop-based, but overall rather sweet. Hop presence but lacks bitterness. Very mild grapefruit in the finish, but again muted. This is a SWEET (meaning sugary) beer!
Quite surprised at the lack of bitterness. Aftertaste is small.
Thirst quenching and drinkable, but not very typical of a West Coast, or indeed an American, IPA."
Clipper City Brewing Co. / Heavy Seas Beer,Heavy Seas - Hang Ten (Weizen Doppelbock),,,Weizenbock,10.00%,bottle,4.38,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,9/2/2007,"Bought as a single from Jax, Sandy Springs, Atlanta, GA, USA. March 2008 notched on the label. One of my favorite styles.
Nice, rich looking brown pour with a creamy mouthfeel and plenty of body. Lots of bold malt upfront and all the way through to the finish. Slightly dry at the end. Alcohol is hidden very well; highly drinkable. Massive bubble-gum influence and some weaker banana flavors too, but the bubble-gum is the strongest flavor. Goes down a treat and with the alcohol so well hidden you need to take care. Sweet upfront as well but this tapers off quickly.
All in all an interesting beer and I am glad that CCB branched out into the style - way too few of this type around."
"Middle Ages Brewing Co., Ltd.",Grail Ale,,,American Amber / Red Ale,5.00%,bottle,4.43,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,9/2/2007,"Purchased as a 12oz single from Michael's, Marietta, GA, USA. I have a sneaking suspicion that this is quite an old bottle (I've seen a few sixers on the shelves for a LONG time, and now Michael's suddenly selling singles!)
Dark amber pour in the Sam Adams new style glass, with a small ivory/yellowish head and some small, but impressive lace.
Initial tastes are rich, malty but also have a strong hint of liquor. A creamy, sherry, maderia like taste - VERY nice. Lots of tasty layers of malt run over one another. A hint of a dry, amber like finish but very little to speak of. Maybe, JUST maybe this has been aged in the store and as a result has taken on quite a new character.
This drinks less like an amber and much more like a rich, ESB. A classic, biscuit like maltiness is very reminiscent of a typical English bitter. Delicious."
Redhook Ale Brewery,Late Harvest Autumn Ale,,,American Amber / Red Ale,5.90%,on-tap,2.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,2,9/1/2007,"$4.00 on tap at Taco Mac, Douglasville, GA, USA.
I think that there is a problem with the cleanliness of the lines at this Taco Mac. Many of the beers have this strange, plastic like taste imparted to them and this was another of those. Maybe this review is not fair in that regard, but for now these are my thoughts.
Looked good in the glass with an amber clarity, small head and some retention. That's where the good experience ended. Lacked taste and had a very, very bitter angle. A lack of definition characterizesthis beer, it's a bit of a blurred mess. Not really an amber, not really a bitter, I just don't think it is a well made beer."
Woodstock Brewing Company (Beer Brands),Woodstock Pilsner,,,German Pilsener,5.40%,bottle,2.88,3,3,2.5,3,3.5,9/1/2007,"Been around for a long time in Atlanta, GA, USA, just getting around to reviewing it now. 12 oz single from Michael's.
Nice yellow color with some head and a little lace, but lacks clarity with some chill haze. Corny nose lacks definition. The taste also lacks definition. In a Pils I am looking for a clean beer and a big, dry hop bite in the finish - this beer doesn't realy provide it.
Has potential but currently it's a beer that needs sharpening up and has to get a better defined edge to make it true to the style."

To be perfectly honest, I was a little wary of this beer. I'm not a huge fan of sour/Brett beers and I was wondering exactly how this would sit with me. On tasting the beer I was delighted that I tried it.
Rather light, golden yellow pour with plenty of large head and nice lace. Looks very good. Light, lemon funk in the nose.
Taste is super. Nice refeshing combo of Saison funk, with some bitter Brett. A little citrus but it is all in check. Very mild.
This beer is nowhere near as aggressive as one might expect and it some ways drinks like a Hennepin that has been slightly ramped up - the first Imperial Saison??!! I'd even go as far as to suggest that this could be a crossover beer for newbies!
Anyway, I really enjoyed the mildly ramped funk and I thought this was an excellent, superbly drinkable brew."
Woodstock Brewing Company (Beer Brands),Woodstock India Pale Ale,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,8.50%,bottle,3.08,3.5,4,3,2.5,2.5,8/31/2007,"Took me an age to get around to trying and reviewing this. Purchased as a single from Michael's, Marietta, GA, USA.
Aroma is VERY promising, plenty of the typical hop characteristics of your usual American, DIPA. Color is a mid-brown with a little chill haze that clears to leave a clear, amber pour. Small head, with a small amont of retention. So far, so good.
Here's the problem; it's just amazingly DRY. Puckeringly dry in fact, and so much so that is takes away from the drinkability of the beer and the taste. Many of the good points in relation to the beer are hopelessly lost in the wickedly dry finish - all rather odd.
A beer that had the potential to be decent, but fell away rather alarmingly."
Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,Sierra Nevada Anniversary Ale (2007-2009),,,American IPA,5.90%,on-tap,3.53,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,8/30/2007,"On draught at the Brick Store, Decatur, GA, USA.
Nice beer, but for me this is a VERY bog-standard IPA. Nothing much to report here. Decent copper color, nice clarity and a decent head. Not bad retention. Looks good.
Some simple west coast pine notes, but not especially pronounced. Drinks easily and tastily, a bit like a poor mans Celebration.
OK beer, but seeing as it is a ""special"" release I thought it was a bit weak. If yu're expecting something special look elsewhere, this is just another, OK, American (west coast hopped) IPA."

Interesting. Being catagorized as an APA I think is rather misleading. This beer drinks MUCH richer tan your typical APA, and even up to the point that I might even call this an ESB!
Really nice, rich copper color, some head and a little lace. Nose and tastes are rich - good, solid malty backbone with a really significant hop dose. Big, sweet, biscuity malts up front and a solid taste. Hops come in at the end with a dry, tanin, tea like finish. VERY tasty all around.
Good depth and a rich beer. Nice."

Excellent copper color and (for me the most important in this style) great clarity. Clear as a bell. Small, creamy, short-lived head with not much lace. retention poor.
Big and malty up front and quickly followed by some organic tasting hops. Some grassy notes. Well balanced.
Very typical for the style, a nice example."
Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,Festina Pêche,,,Berliner Weissbier,4.50%,bottle,2.2,3,2.5,2,2.5,2,8/27/2007,"12oz bottle, from a 4-pack. 
OK. Had a few Berliner Weissbiers in the past, but almost always with the added syrup. I think this style NEEDS the added syrup so I was a bit concerned about the fact that apparently the syrup had been replaced by fruit in the form of peaches. I wasn't sure it would work, but in matters such as these I tend to trust DFH.
Obviously light and cloudy looking, pretty much exactly as I was expecting. Some peach in the nose, but not much. To be honest I think the ABV is a little high for the style. As for the taste, well the peach flavor does NOT make an impact in the way that the syrup would, and as a result this is basically a tart, light beer that is unsatisfied by the peach. Mouthfeel is weak. All in all, the tartness, the lack of significant flavor, the weakness of the fruit and the ABV fail to bring this beer together for me.
Quite a weak offering from DFH, this is one of those DFH beers that just doesn't quite capture it. With such innovative brewing there will always be a few misses, this is one of them."
Bierbrouwerij De Koningshoeven B.V.,Tilburg's Dutch Brown Ale,,,Belgian Dark Ale,5.00%,bottle,3.33,3,3.5,3.5,2,3.5,8/26/2007,"Purchased as a single from Michaels (I think). 11.2 oz bottle. Poured into the Koningshoeven small goblet.
Good depth of color with a deep brown body, but small head and virtually no retention.
Plenty of caramel notes in the nose with a little alcohol. I like the taste; plenty of malty sweetness, good sugary caramel notes and some bitterness in the finish. 
Mouthfeel is where this beer fails. ""Thin"" might be pushing it, but it's not great.
Very lacking in depth for the style, but a decent English Brown Ale (if that makes sense)."
Mendocino Brewing Company,Red Tail Lager,,,American Pale Lager,4.50%,bottle,3.75,3,3,4,4,4,8/26/2007,"Single from Michaels.
Light amber pour with a strange combo of great clarity at the bottom of the glass, but surprising cloudiness at the top. Odd.
Head is scant, lace is nowhere to be seen.
Mild whisky notes, very smooth, quite drinkable. Strangely this has a liquor based taste, a little oak, a little vanilla and really quite tasty and sweet. Surprisingly rich. Has an English Pale Ale feel about it.
Odd beer. If anything reminded me of an old ale or a vanilla or oaked beer! Very perculiar."
Private Weissbierbrauerei G. Schneider & Sohn GmbH,Schneider-Brooklyner Hopfen-Weisse,,,Weizenbock,8.20%,bottle,3.1,3,4,3,3,2.5,8/26/2007,"Picked up a bottle of this at Green's on Buford on a Friday morning beer run and then went to the Brick Store the same afternoon to find (to my great surprise) that they still had it on tap there too. Combined review of the two experiences.
On tap this looked great! Had a golden orange body and was served in the specific glass for the beer which is a thing of beauty itself. In the bottle at home I poured it into a Tucher Weizen 500 mL glass and it was brown! Seriously brown like dirty water or iced tea brown. Not very attractive. Both servings had good heads and decent lace. That's where the differences ended, both serving types resembled one another in all other ways.
Caramelized bananas greet the nose. Nice. A little alcohol too, this is promising. Tastes start with some clove and banana and then this kind of dries up and takes on a whole load of American IPA characteristics - aggressive hops, bittering and somewhat unbalanced. Hefe up front, DIPA in the back. Alcohol is poorly hidden and a little burning to be honest.
I dunno, to me this is an uncomfortable marriage that doesn't really work. It's not a bad beer (looked good on draught, much less attractive in the bottle), but the unbalanced hops and very prevelant alcohol both take away from the beer and reduce the drinkability for me. Draught better than bottle. I won't bother again - great looking glass though!"
Birrificio Le Baladin,Baladin Nora,,,Herbed / Spiced Beer,6.80%,bottle,4.43,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,8/25/2007,"$12.99 Arbor Place Beverage, Douglasville, GA, USA. 750 mL with one of those stay fresh caps - a cross between a cap and a cork.
Interesting story behind this purchase. I know for a fact that this particular bottle had been sitting on the shelves in the store for at least three years, and that the beer was almost certainly even older than that. I bought it with a little trepidation, but at the same time I was quite confident that the store had done the cellaring work for me. Took it down to the Brick Store for Dave, Mike, Lee and the gang to try. We were not disappointed.
Nice looking, cloudy orange pour with plenty of head, but that faded pretty quickly. The aromas were spiced as anticipated with some cinnamon, cardamon and a little all-spice. Quite strong in the nose.
Having smelled the beer I was half expecting some kind of wild onslaught against the tastebuds on the first swig, but I was amazed at how smooth it was. The spice had perfectly melded together to make a VERY mild tasting beer. A little orange zest, maybe some rosemary?? Some sweetness up front but this faded quickly to reveal more spice but it was extremely mellow. A tiny bit of funk, but not much at all - a small acidic bite. I've never had a fresh bottle of this so I have no frame of reference, but my guess is that the harsh spices mellow over time, and this is a beer that benefits greatly from aging. As Dave said, you could almost feel the mellowing of the taste - it felt aged!
All in all pretty interesting, and quite refreshing. It went down very well and was clearly a smoothed out beer that surprised me a lot. I was expecting something with much more edge; maybe the fresher bottles have that characteristic."

Poured into a chalice, the head is fleeting leaving some spotty lace. Light golden body with some carbonation. A certain fruitiness and tartness about the brew, but I don't think I could identify it as pommegranate.



Lacks the typical cadied sugar and yeast notes that I am usually looking for in the style, so as a result, even hough I enjoyed th beer I thought it was a little out of style and not my idea of a classic BPA. In short, OK but not my favorite."

I've had a few Breckenridge beers that I have been really impressed with, so my hopes were high. Unfortunately this didn't quite come up to par. All the attributes of an amber/red, but the whole package lacks depth. Almost like a watered down version of the style.



Not quite red enough in the Sam Adams new style glass, without much lacing. More dark/golden orange than anything else. Lacks a great head despite the nucleation sites in the glass and therefore very little lace too.



Taste lacks a real bitter definition and the finish is not as dry as it might be for the style. Some hop profile in the aroma and to be honest I think the smell is the strongest feature of this beer. Not that it is unpleasant, it just lacks presence.



The higher ABV Breckenridge beers in the 471 series have been much more interesting to me so far."
Avery Brewing Company,Avery Anniversary Ale - Fourteen,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,9.50%,bottle,3.53,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,8/17/2007,"For all intents and purposes this drinks like a stout. 
Black pour with a creamy head, dark chocolate raisin notes in the nose and in the taste and the mouthfeel is VERY dense and creamy. Dense, creamy, conservative lace. 
Plenty of smooth, creamy hop bitterness and a smooth finish. Mild bitterness lingers with some hint of dark fruity ""Belgianess"", but still this seems to be a stout.
I need a different edge in my Belgian Strong Dark's and this fails to deliver that. Distinct lack of Belgian yeast characteristics and the stout character overwhelms this beer and takes it WAY out of style.
ABV well hidden.
In simple drinking terms THIS IS A CLOSE TO A STOUT. Fine, but fails to really do the job for me. I get annoyed when styles are pushed to the point where the beer becomes something else."
Jolly Pumpkin Artisan Ales,Bam Bière,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,4.50%,bottle,3.45,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,8/15/2007,"I'm not in love with JP beers by any stretch of the imagination, mainly because when they classify a beer within a style I only crack it open to find a beer that is full of funk and therefore OUT of style. Of course with this being labeled a Saison, the funk is appropriate and I will score it higher accordingly.



$6.00, 12oz bottle, Taco Mac, Marietta. Pours a golden hazy color with a good looking, rocky, large head. Ice-cream like on the top, but much less dense at the bottom of the head with some quite large bubbles.



Happy (for a change) to report a JP beer with significant funk in the nose - in this case appropriate. Smooth and easy drinking, this does have a little much sourness for my taste, but at least that particular element is OK in this beer - in so many other JP beers it is not. Tasty notes of weak honey and apples.



Not my favorite beer in the style, nor my favorite brewer, but this beer is a t least non-offensive."
"Marston, Thompson & Evershed, Plc.",Marks & Spencer India Pale Ale,,,English India Pale Ale (IPA),5.50%,bottle,3.58,4,3,3.5,4,4,8/12/2007,"Picked this up at the Exeter M&S as a gift pack that included one bottle, one decent looking, etched glass mug and a nice stainless steel opener for the knockdown price of 1 GBP as a clearance item from Father's Day! Lovely jubbly.



Decent amber colored pour with some good head that surprised me with its level of retention. Body looks substantial. Simple hop profile, put together with plenty of malts to back it up. Quintessentially ""English"" in flavor with plenty of sweetish malts meaning that the hops are not big, especially considering the IPA moniker. Lightweight in terms of bitterness.



Finish is smooth with some caramel and other burned sugars. Easy drinking, and at the price unbeatable."
Fuller Smith & Turner PLC,Discovery Blonde Beer,,,English Pale Ale,3.90%,cask,2.45,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,2,8/10/2007,"Mmm, quite why this is classified as a Pale Ale I'm not sure. Golden Ale on the label, and a golden beer in the bottle - fair enough!



Yellow pour with a small, well formed head. VERY light in every department. You can tell it is a real ale - JUST - but in terms of taste, aroma and general character there is almost none. A cross between a watered down wheat beer and a lager, the beer quickly loses its way and falls into nomansland. Light, floral notes and not much else.



I think that this is a classic examle of a serious brewer attempting to pander to a perceived (ar indeed real) market of people that don't like real ale much. A very odd product for Fuller's to be producing."
Brouwerij De Landtsheer NV,Malheur 10°,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,10.00%,bottle,4.88,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,8/9/2007,"Small (33 cl?) bottle courtesy of Dave at The Brick Store.



Very special brew. Poured into an elegant wine glass like vessel it shows a classic yellow/golden pour and a lovely, finely formed head. The head sets the tone for the beer and for the mouthfeel which is almost silky. VERY fine carbonation.



Sweet, layer after layer of yeasty goodness. Mild clove and banana cut across the first few sips, but this is followed by a more intense alcohol spurt in line with the high ABV. Mouthfeel is exceptionally smooth nad the finish is slightly dry but very well rounded.



Drinkability? Off the chart. One of the best Belgian brews I have ever had the pleasure of drinking."

Simple looking brew with an darkish, amber body the looks a little thin. Decent head, some lace and retention. Aroma is ALL grapefruit and to me it is wonderful. A LOT of depth in the nose. Happily the aspect of the grapefruit that comes through most in the taste is the bitterness as opposed to much fruit. The combination works well againast a pretty strong backbone.



Beautifully balanced, this is one of my favorite tasting beers. The ABV makes is just about sessionable too. A few pints of this after work would suit me just fine, too bad The JT is not very convenient for Atlanta, GA, USA!"
AleSmith Brewing Company,AleSmith Speedway Stout,,,American Double / Imperial Stout,12.00%,bottle,4.6,4,4,5,4.5,4.5,7/12/2007,"750 mL, elegant, screen-printed bottle with dense silver foil on the neck. Capped. Thanks go out to someone(!) as part of a great trade - apologies but I forget who, this was a long time ago. Vintage? I'm not sure.
I went for the UK pint glass - I like my stouts as pints - the full 20 oz mind you, too! No girly tulip for me.
Another MASSIVE beer with a MASSIVE hype - we'll see.
Jet black, viscous pour, but to be honest the head and lace is disappointing. Creamy coffee and alcohol dominate the aroma. Mild and non-aggressive which was surprising to me (and welcome). Carbonation is low, and the mouthfeel is good (creamy) bu there is a slight hint of fine, stinging bubbles AND some residual ethanol.
Tastes are obviously coffee dominated, but plenty of alcohol too. Although the alcohol IS present, it paradoxically seems well concealed - BIG but controlled.
Finish has more alcohol residue.
Despite what I have written above, this very large beer does have most of its components under control. It does have alcohol present, but it is all in check as is the very obvious but somehow subtle coffee. This an interesting beer to me since it seems really big but at the same time quite subtle - an odd combo and difficult to pull off. Well crafted."
Victory Brewing Company,Sunrise Weiss,,,Hefeweizen,5.70%,bottle,2.98,2.5,3,3,3,3,7/12/2007,"12 oz bottle as part of a sixer, Hilton Head, SC, USA. At the time this had not made it to GA.



Pour is OK, but lacks the wheat haze appearance that I would normally expect. Some carbonation, but a disappointing lack of head, lace and retention.



Decent sweet, bubble-gum, banana aroma but lacks a bit in the taste. A bit lightweight all around. A little acidic in the finish.



Not the best Hefe, nor is it Victory's best beer. A little disappointed."
Pivzavod Baltika / Baltic Beverages Holding,Baltika #7 Export,,,Dortmunder / Export Lager,5.40%,bottle,3.13,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,7/11/2007,"Purchased at Beverage Resort in Kennesaw, GA, USA (the home of Eastern European adjunct, macro lager!). 1 pint .9 fl oz green bottle, blue and silver labels on body and neck.



It's a sweet, adjunct lager that is very reminiscent of all of the other Baltika's. It looks a little better than many of a similar ilk - good, pale straw color, nice carbonation and a decent head (even a little lace), but outside of that nothing to report.



Residual sweetness upfront and lingering. On its side it is fairly clean and pretty refreshing, but not much less to tell you."
Victory Brewing Company,Whirlwind Witbier,,,Witbier,5.00%,bottle,2.38,2,2.5,2.5,2.5,2,7/11/2007,"Purchased as a sixer in Hilton Head, SC, USA just a few days or weeks before this made it to Atlanta. Victory had already made it here but Whirlwind was NOT in the initial wave of Victory products, but now (mid-July 2007, it's here).
12 oz bottle. Pour is disappointingly flat - lack of head and lace (which to me is a real problem for a Wit) is alarming, and carbonation is light, but at the same time over FIZZY - a very odd combo. Nose has the yeast and spice, but also an odd mixture of sweet, adjunct type macros - not great. Tastes lack Wit characteristics.
Mouthfeel lacks silk and is somewhat watery.
IMO this is NOT a good Wit. It lacks body, and is WAY too reminiscent of a macro lager for my liking. Poor example and not very nice."

Dave pulled this one out as a sample a few days ago. He was having one hell of a time with the carbonation of the keg, and it took him forever to pour a small glass.
Pour is about as pale a yellow as you can imagine. Basically it has the appearance of a washed out or watered down Wit beer. Head was good and there was plenty of lace. Certainly a little tartness, but not especially lemony or acidic on my palate.
The guys at the Brick Store were calling this a ""childrens beer"" and there's no doubt that it drinks close to (or even below!) it's 3.00% ABV. There is simply nothing to this beer. The mouthfeel, taste, smell and whole package are all incredibly muted to say the least. I KNOW that's par for the course when it comes to the style, but this seemed even more muted than ever.
Not something I would bother trying much of again, I think I'll save it for the kids!"
Black Toad Brewing Co.,Black Toad Dark Ale,,,English Brown Ale,5.30%,bottle,3.55,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,7/9/2007,"12 oz single from Trader Joe's purchased just before they cut off the single sales in their GA stores.



Bit of a murky brown pour, but held up to the light I get some VERY distinct red tones. Small head that disappears quickly and very little lace.



Nutty and lightly fruited nose and similar tastes. Very light mouthfeel and not really Porter like at all. I would call this a Brown Ale as much as anything EXCEPT for the very slightly smoky finish. Tiny bitterness in the ending too. Up to that point it behaves largely like a brown ale. A little dry chocolate in the finish too.



Another interesting beer from the Trader Joe's collection, and I was glad I tried it. EXTREMELY good value for a simple, but drinkable beer."
Brasserie Artisanale De Rullés SPRL,La Rullés Triple (Bière De Gaume),,,Tripel,8.40%,on-tap,3.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,7/9/2007,"On-tap, the Brick Store, Decatur, GA, USA. Small pour in the correct glassware (as ever). Has the appearance of a high quality Wit, but with a better head (rocky, dense and bone-white).



The second beer that I have had in the last couple of weeks that I would describe as a ""light"" tripel. The standard charactersitcs ARE there, but the tell-tale alcohol and Belgian candied and yeast characteristics are somewhat muted and depressed.



The upside of this is that the beer becomes drinkable and refreshing, but at the same time it is rather unsatisfying. This is compounded by the small pour which means that the glass is drained VERY quickly without the feeling of much satisfaction.



I dunno, OK but many, many better examples of the style are very easy to find."
Lagunitas Brewing Company,Lagunitas Sirius Ale,,,Cream Ale,7.00%,on-tap,4,4,4,4,4,4,7/9/2007,"This has been in GA for a little while now, but I didn't get around to picking any up - to be honest the thought of another, bland and uninteresting Cream Ale hardly set my pulse racing. Anyway, I was discussing the likelihood that ths beer was not particularly interesting with brickstoredave, when he said, ""actually its pretty good"". Dave and I don't always agree on such matters so I was still a bit sceptical as he offered up a draft sample.



I was pleasantly suprised. Offered up as a macro colored lager with a nice, pillow-like head the first obvious departure from a ""normal"" Cream Ale is in the nose. WAY more hops than I was expecting. Don't get me wrong, this is NOT a hoppy beer, but for the style it's off the chart. This is carried through to the taste where malts still dominate but there is a distinct hop presence - again, much more than the style would usually allow. Couple this with the relatively high (again for the style) ABV, and you have a surprisingly aggressive and characterful brew.



I would say out of style, but nevertheless a really nice, refreshing and significant beer - not at all what I was expecting. Drink on!"
Trader Joe's Brewing Company,Trader Joe's Bohemian Lager,,,Czech Pilsener,5.00%,bottle,3.53,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,7/9/2007,"Yet another 12 oz single from a recent Trader Joe's booty. 



In summary, a drinkable lager but a poor ""Czech Pils"". Pour is golden and looks good in the Sweetwater Pils glass. Nice, continuous carbonation with a wispy head and a little lace.



Sweet, malty nose and not much mention of any bitterness or hops. Much the same can be said of the taste. Crisp and clean, sweet and quite tasty, but little or no bitterness that should come with a Saaz hop (or similar) profile.



OK to drink as a refreshing lager, but not exciting as a Pils. Good value (again) from TJ's."

(I think it said 9.1% on the label as opposed to 9.6 listed currently in the BA db.



Suprisingly light colored pour with a great looking head and plenty of lace.



Pretty sweet, and although there are plenty of West Coast type hops upfront, and indeed throughout the beer, the overwhelming sensation that I get is the sweetness. Quite slick in the mouth too.



Pretty much as I expected, but the beer was a little too sweet even for me as someone who gnerally likes a malty beer."

Deep orange color in the body and an impressive and encouraging head sitting in the Duvel tulip. 
A very simple Belgian Pale - no frills, not much to report but solid. Alcohol is present but not overpowering, however there was a hottish finish to this beer. 
Typical Belgian candied sugars and yeasts, but all in check. Very mild spice - a steady example.
Nice introduction to the style, very simple, very compact and an easy crossover beer. I'd definitely recommend it."
Miller Brewing Co.,Miller Chill,,,Light Lager,4.10%,bottle,2.75,3,3,3,2.5,2,7/7/2007,"I SPECIFICALLY went to my local Sports Bar in Villa Rica, GA, USA, to try this. Anyone visiting Villa Rica, GA should visit the Sports Cafe etc (yes, that's its name with the etc. added), just for the experience (however I cannot imagine why you WOULD be visiting Villa Rica). $3.50 a bottle, I tried a couple.



Poured into an iced mug, this is what it is - no more, no less.



There is a hint of citrus but I do not get the ""salt"" factor. Very good head is formed (at least in the short term) and it IS pretty refreshing as long as you expect very little.



Macro lager it is; refreshing too, but what can you say? I suggest that if you are a true Beer Advocate that you try it at least once, record your thoughts and then move on!"

Superb example of the style. Looks great with a beautiful color, great carbonation a fantastic head with good retention and some nice lace. Just about as good as this style can look.



Bags of peppery hops in the nose, and replicated in the short, but sharp finish.



Just about all you can ask for in a traditional Pils. Clean, refreshing, thirst quenching, and a dry character that accentuates the sharp hop ending. Perfect warm weather drinking, great for any kind of outdoor event.



Should also represent a great crossover opportunity for the BI's amongst us."

Very simple, subtle, malty classic English ESB style (not Winter Warmer IMO) bitter.



Lots of biscuit malts (Digestive and caramel) with a smattering of hop character over the top. Mildly fruity in the nose and the taste, this beer shows class in depth and its drinkability is off the chart for me.



Crystal clear, tawny brown pour with a ovely head and plenty of very sticky lace. Sweet nose, this beer drinks well below 6% and seesm to resemble a sessionable lower ABV beer ore than would be expected.



Delicious any time of year, a true English classic and a beer that shows off the best side of imported, classy, subtle, sessionable imported brews."

Aggresive pour gives a nice head, but it is scant and short lived and there is a distinct lace of lace. Body has a true golden, tripel coloration.



Some bubble gum in the nose.



This drinks like watered down tripel! There are hints of the Belgian yeasts, candied sugar, banana, other fruits and alcohol, but frankly the whole pacjage seems very muted. The side-effect of this is that the alcohol is also seriously muted and this feels NOTHING like the advetised 9.1%.



A bit odd to be honest - this feels like a 50-75% tripel to me, (almost) pretty typical, but just not there.



A bit of a shame really because I have heard some good things about Marin and this is my first example which is frankly a bit of a let down."
Bear Republic Brewing Co.,Racer 5 India Pale Ale,,,American IPA,7.00%,bottle,4.48,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,7/3/2007,"22 oz bomber, thanks to Solomon420 for the trade. 



I've been wanting to get my hands on this for a long time for two reasons; firstly because Bear Republic has built a wonderful reputation with me, and secondly because I have continued to hear great things about this particular brew. It was worth the wait and BR and this beer did not let me down.



Popping the cap causes an instant strong hop aroma to waft across the kitchen. The pour is a cloudy, tan/orange combo with a good initial head and some lace. Not a huge carbonation factor at all, but still looks solid in the glass.



Plenty of sweetish hops in the nose. The smell is is not as aggressive as one might think it would be. Again some very subtle flavors. Yes there's plenty of hops, but the malts are strong and hold their own in a sweet (literally) combo. Mildly metallic, mild tangerines and slight grapefruit combine nicely in the mouth with the more astringent and acidic grapefruit rounding out the IPA experience. Definitely some citrus peel in that mix too.



Drinks under the 7.00% ABV, this is one of the West Coast beers that stays away from enormous, resinous hops and still pulls off a great IPA hop bomb without going over the top. A more difficult feat to achieve than simply piling in loads and loads of hops until the roof of your mouth is raw.



Excellently crafted, a super beer."
Bear Republic Brewing Co.,Red Rocket Ale,,,American Amber / Red Ale,6.80%,bottle,4.58,5,4.5,4.5,4,5,7/2/2007,"22 oz bomber, thanks to Solomon420 for the trade.
True balance is rare, this beer has it. The pour is exceptional; tawny brown body, AMAZING light tan colored head and great, lingering, complex lace. Put it all together and you have a great looking pint.
Nutty brown ale feel with a dose of centennial hops on top. Bitterness is there but it is beautifully inter-woven into the malts and the beer boasts 65 IBU's of sheer balance. A mild, tea like after taste including a tannin dry finish.
Nose is sweet and clean, and the package comes together to make the beer nigh on impossible to put down. A classic American Amber that is possibly THE best example of the style out there.
In a way I am glad that this is not distributed in GA since I enjoy it all the more when I get a chance to tuck in."
Spanish Peaks Brewing Co.,Summer White (Seasonal),,,Witbier,4.70%,bottle,3.2,3,3,3,3,4,7/2/2007,"12 oz bottle as part of a $6.99 mixed single at Mac's, Atlanta, GA, USA.



A very standard American Wit that is more refreshing than most. Lots of sediment (as expected) but also some odd, white chalk like particles the like of which I have not seen before.



Standard cloudy yellow body with a nice (if somewhat short-lived) head and lace.



The usual spiced aromas are there, with a little clove etc.



Tastes are standard American Wit ones, but where this beer does shine is in its refreshing qualities. It seems exceptionally thirst-quenching. As a result the drinkability score goes up.



Very standard offering, but at the same time an easy (and good) drinker. Don't know if I would want a sixer, but the ocassional bottle would be welcome."
AleSmith Brewing Company,AleSmith IPA,,,American IPA,7.30%,bottle,4.45,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,7/1/2007,"22 oz bomber courtesy of Damian (Solomon420). Thank-you.
Pour yields a classic orange color with a mild cloudiness, a beautiful head, great lacing BUT a little more in the way of suspended particles than I was expecting. Were it not for those particles I might have giving this a 5 for appearance.
Nose as expected, but a little sweeter than some of the big, West Coast IPA's. Taste is pretty much as expected for a beer of the origin and the style. The hops ARE big, but there is a subtlety about the beer - an uncommon trait in this type of brew. Either the malt backbone or other features temper the hop boldness to some degree - this helps the drinkability. Mild grapefruit rounds the beer out. Less pine-resin than other West Coast examples and I think this may be why this is very well thought of by many - a more rounded example of the style.
A little alcohol warmth in the finish but its all in check. Obviously much bigger than a contemporary English IPA, but a classic example of the West Coast, American version."

Well, I just don't get it. This is simply another typical JP, over-funked beer. Don't get me wrong, I like funky beers but PLEASE don't label them as something they are clearly NOT. I don't mind style guidelines being stretched either, but making a ""Brown Ale"" or a ""Wit"" funked, just doesn't cut it - why not call them ALL American Wild Ales??



Nice head on the pour with a decent brown color. Unfortunately everything is overwhelmed by funk. Completely out of style, very annoying."

Pours somewhat macro looking, with a clear golden body, a small head but with better lacing than one would normally associate with a macro lager.



Aroma is distinctly ""Belgian"", but muted and not obvious. Standard sugars (mild), a little alcohol and characteristic yeast.



This is a very light ""Belgian"" Pale and it reminded me a little of Duvel, but MUCH, MUCH lighter. Duvel light anyone? Initially served WAY too cold, the beer develops with temperature to give a mild aniseed and light floral/clove note. Yeast and sugar character is muted/toned down. Carbonation was a little off for me too.



Very drinkable, but not really my idea of a Belgian. I just want much more substance all around."
Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company,Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy,,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,4.20%,bottle,1.43,1,1,1.5,2,1.5,6/29/2007,"12 oz single for Mac's, Atlanta, GA, USA as part of the $6.99 mixed sixer.



OK, let's be quite clear about the problem here. The original Shandy is made with a mixture of mediocre beer of some desciption (either lager or bitter) and ENGLISH lemonade. English lemonade is a sugary, carbonated NEUTRAL beverage similar to Sprite or 7-Up. The whole ""lemon"" thing when it comes to English lemonade is a bit of a misnomer. NOTE TO MILLER: Do NOT use American style lemonade in Shandy's! This leads to a horrible concoction that is close to undrinkable.



This pours deep yellow color, completely clouded. The smell is of lemon scented bathroom cleaner and the taste is (what I imagine to be) not far off. A nasty, acidic ending also taints with this ""drink"", and the whole thing is what I imagine drinking lemon flavored Pine Sol would be like.



Problem simple to solve - use ENGLISH lemonade (or Sprite) as an alternative to American lemonade. In the meantime - YUK."

Attractive bottle in the usual Flying Dog/Steadman style. VERY bready nose comes from the cloudy yellow body. A classic Wit color. Mild spice and mild acid meld well together. A sharp, citrus finish but it sits well. Some very, very mild white pepper.



Drinkability is high and I found this extremely refreshing. A nice example of the style."

Very light orange pour that is very clouded - chill haze and some sediment? Medium head, but some nice lace.



Quite a sweet, grainy nose. The hop character here is a bit out of whack for me. I get a bitterness that although in check, seems to be a little too big for the malts present. It's harsh in context, not necessarily overly harsh in general. A little dry aftertaste, not quite in line. Smooth in the mouth, carbonation is at a good level. I also got a touch of sweet fruit - pineapple??



Another beer that would be better much better under these circumstances;



(a) Fresher,

(b) Closer to the source

(c) In the keg or cask



I'm not sure about this, it's lacking something but I can't quite put my finger on it. In the meantime it's a decent if not spectacular English style bitter."
Brooklyn Brewery,Brooklyn Summer Ale,,,English Pale Ale,5.00%,bottle,4,3.5,3,4.5,4,4,6/24/2007,"Attractive 12 oz single from Mac's as part of the $6.99 mixed sixer. Glad to pick this one up as a single, as I didn't really want a full complement. Attractive Blue & Yellow pastel label.



Absolute golden clarity on the pour with a nice head. Virtually no lace. No hint of wheat. A bit of a strange bitter, grapefruit twang in the nose. Mildly chemical.



This reminds me so much of an English IPA. Very mild hop character, but full of layers of flavorful malt. Very tasty.



Not quite sure why, or even IF, this should be characterized as a Pale Wheat, in fact I might even characterize it AS an English IPA, but it's bitterness is not quite there. Lovely balance, a very well crafted beer.



Nice. Easy Summer drinking, but no a typical, super-light Summer beer that sometimes get produced in the name of the season."

Light gold pour, not much head or lace. Pretty sweet and grainy, but no skunk, fairly smooth and a decent balance.



Macro characteristics (obviously) but at the same time a refreshing beer and a good combo of simple malt and regular hops. Finish is clean.



I would call this a decent, sumertime, macro replacement. Don't expect too much and you probably won't be disappointed."
Ridgeway Brewing,Criminally Bad Elf,,,English Barleywine,10.50%,bottle,4.7,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,6/23/2007,"Definitely the best of the three Bad Elf series that I have had so far. 500 mL bottle.
$6.88 from Beverage Mart in Ackworth, GA, USA. This has probably been aging in the store for at least six months, likely even a little longer. It's held up and matured very nicely.
Aggresive pour into the pint glass gives a nice, bone white head and even a little lace.
This is a quintessential English BW. Great clarity, a beautiful dark amber color and minimal carbonation. It's ALL malt and alcohol, with a tiny bit of hop character to back it up. If you are an American drinker DON'T expect huge hops in an ENGLISH BW, it ain't happening. What you will get is a big, malty, alcohol bomb - this is it!
A little warmth on the way down, but one of the smoother English BW's which is surprising to me considering the high ABV. Some port character in the finish, absolutely super. Considering the size of his beer this is amazingly drinkable."
Victory Brewing Company,Victory Lager,,,Munich Helles Lager,4.80%,bottle,3,2,2,4,3,2,6/22/2007,"Purchased as a sixer of 12 oz bottles in Hilton Head, SC, USA. Although Victory has recently made it to GA, this beer is not one of those that is coming our way just yet.



Definitely a macro like appearance. Low carbonation, perfect clarity but a head that is gone within one minute and no lace. Nose is very unimpressive - frankly it's also VERY macro-like. Lots of grassy, corny, adjunct-like smells with plenty of boiled vegetables!



Taste is much better than the aroma would suggest. Simple, clean quite dry with a very mild, grassy hop finish. Slight aftertaste and a mild bitterness. Dry. 



Simple beer that doesn't try too hard (which is fine) but for me it's a bit hit and miss."
Melbourn Bros.,Melbourn Bros. Apricot,,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,3.40%,bottle,3.93,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,6/21/2007,"Won't be everyone's cup of tea, but I enjoyed it.



Extremely attractive pour, especially the golden, crystal clear body. Good head, but lace is scant and quickly gone.



Aroma has obvious fruit, but to me it's a little more like a mild, low alcohol, scrumpy apple nose. Taste too is obviously fruit, and although less apple like it is still not easy for me to pin down as *specifically* Apricot.



Drinks very easy with a big sweetness but at the same time it has a pleasing tang of sharpness at the end. Very clean. ABV means you could drink this until the cows come home, but to be honest you probably wouldn't want to. Definitely worth a try."

http://www.kirawhitebeer.com/



Just above average all the way around. The aroma, taste and mouthfeel are all there, but nothing else or above average to report. Very mild spice and an aroma that is reminiscent of light, grassy hay.



This will sell (and drink) pretty well all summer in hot places like Atlanta (and I may drink some of it myself), but it's not particularly memorable.



Decent, but in no way spectacular.



By all means try it once, it may be your last try!"
Lagunitas Brewing Company,12th Anniversary Undercover Investigation Shut-Down Ale,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,9.90%,bottle,4.33,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,6/17/2007,"It's big, it's bold and it's good. An Arrogant Bastard clone, this is a super beer. 22oz bomber, Bullock's, Marietta, GA, USA.



Pour is a good looking copper colored pour with a nice head. Lace is a little scant. It's BIG hops all around including the nose and the taste, but the malts have the backbone to support the whole thing. Nice bitterness bites in the end.



Very smooth, and although the alcohol is obvious it's very do-able and the whole thing comes together well. Perhaps a touch more edgy than the Bastards, nevertheless this is a very nice substitute. I suggest getting some soon."
Pittsburgh Brewing Co.,Iron City Beer,,,American Adjunct Lager,4.50%,bottle,2.65,2,2,3,3,2.5,6/17/2007,"Single, 12oz bottle, Jax, Sandy Springs, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Perhaps a little lighter and cloudier than your standard crystal clear macro pour, but much the same in all other respects. Brief, highly carbonated head, gone in seconds, no lace.
A very large whiff of corn/adjuncts on opening and the classic veggie tastes. Finishes clean, so that's in its favor, but that's about it. Ice cold on boiling hot days at approx $5-6 a sixer I might consider it; in all other situations I almost certainly wouldn't.
Nothing to report here - move on."
Hop Back Brewery plc,Hopback Summer Lightning,,,English Bitter,5.00%,bottle,4.55,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,6/16/2007,"Very nice.



Clear, golden pour with good carbonation but this fades quickly and there is not much lace. Mildly disappointed in the look (perhaps a function of the bottling). Very distinct hop aroma with almost a sweet, oak aged or whisky type smell - VERY attractive!



Extremely light drinking, this is well named. Refreshing and initial sweetness is backed up with perfect balance that takes the drinkability to a new level. I am guessing that this suffers a little in the bottle, so, fresher and casked (or even kegged) I'd imagine that this would blow my mind. Has a slight herbal quality, and is smooth as silk.



Final thoughts - can't wait until I get home to try this."
Mahrs Bräu,Mahr's Christmas Bock,,,Bock,6.00%,bottle,3.53,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,6/16/2007,"Bullock's, Marietta, GA, USA as a single. Quite why a Maibock/Helles is being marketed as a ""Christmas Bock"" I'm not sure, but there it is.



Opening the bottle produces some pretty aggresive foaming. Pour is a cloudy, honey colored body and comes with an impressive, rocky head. The carbonation continues to impress in the glass. Good looking beer. Plenty of residual sweetness with brown sugar and burned molasses - surprising for such a ligh colored brew. Minor hop bitterness cuts across the finish (like a mild Pils) with some alcohol. Despite the initial sweetness, it still finishes quite dry.



To me this is a bit of an odd combination of textures and flavors but it sort of works. Not sure if this is a very typical Maibock/Helles, but it presents nicely and drinks OK."
Stoudts Brewing Co.,Stoudt's Gold Lager,,,Munich Helles Lager,5.00%,bottle,3.63,3.5,3,4,3.5,3.5,6/16/2007,"Pretty new addition to the Stoudt's line that makes it to GA. $4.25, 12oz bottle, Taco Mac, Marietta, GA, USA.



Label is black, gold and white rather than the one in the db currently.



This is the kind of beer I refer to as a craft standard. Absolutely nothing spectacular, but a solid example of the style and in some ways an excellent crossover beer for the BI's. Nice balance of malts and a little bittering hops.



Looks like a macro (except for the deeper gold color and the better head and lace) and also drinks a little like one. Obviously there is a lot more depth to the body and taste, and a ton more flavor, but it still has some typical, adjunct lager characteristics.



Nice, simple beer, the kind of thing that Stoudt's does very well."

Hop Back Brewery plc,Hopback Entire Stout,,,English Stout,4.50%,bottle,4.25,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,6/15/2007,"Black body with a colossal head and persistent, big carbonation. Great looking, but the carbonation is mildly annoying. Great lace and the towering almost solid-like head makes this an impressive beer in the glass. Single 1 Pint .9 fl oz bottle from Michaels, Marietta, GA, USA.



Plenty of lactose sweetness in the nose.



A light and easy drinking stout that manages to pull it off by still being full of flavor and satisfying. Sometimes these lower ABV stouts can be a little light and not creamy enough, but this beer pulls the whole package together beautifully.



A definite milk chocolate feel. Even as far as being a slightly lactose taste. Smooth (despite the minor prickle from the carbonation) and highly drinkable.



Best English beer that I have had in a while and I would love to try this fresh and closer to the source."
Steinhaus Brewing Co.,Jumping Cow Amber Ale,,,American Amber / Red Ale,5.50%,bottle,3.88,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,6/14/2007,"Yet another pretty decent beer bought as a single from Trader Joe's for $1.09. 12 oz bottle.



Very light color for an amber, this has a real orange color that is reminscent of a classic English IPA. A thin film on the surface and some minimal lace. Extremely malty and sweet in the nose and this is reflected in the taste. English type biscuit malts are very obvious. Nice.



Lots and lots of sweet, toffee and caramel malts. Kind of mild hop bitterness in the extreme finish.



Another, good value, solid offering from the Trader Joe stable."
Steinhaus Brewing Co.,Fat Weasel Ale,,,American Strong Ale,7.10%,bottle,3.45,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,6/13/2007,"12 oz single from Trader Joe's, $1 for the bottle.



Pour shows a mid-gold color with some head and surprisingly some lace. This looks (and looks) much more like a lager than an ale.



Quite a prevalent alcohol content (seems even higher than it actually is) and the feel is quite viscous too. To me this is a bit of an odd beast. An Ale that feels like a high alcohol malt liquor, but finishes with the bitterness of a Pils. Pretty dry in the finish too. Mild burn on the way down. This brew is a little rough around the edges, I might even say unrefined.



Not a bad beer, and good value (again) from Trader Joe's, but having said that I didn't really care for it much."

Better than average AB product, poorer than average Amber Ale (which for me is what it most closely resembles). Standard pour with a decent color but as usual head and lace are basically non-existent.



Aroma and tastes are vaguely based in toasted malt and caramel sweetness but remain non-descript. Decent carbonation, good clarity.



Drinks OK, but this is a pretty bland beer in the grand scheme of things. I wonder if this is actually EXACTLY the same as so many other AB stealth beers? BLAH. Low expectations are largely met here."
Brouwerij Smisje,Wostyntje,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,7.00%,bottle,2.58,2,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,6/11/2007,"Michael's, Marietta, GA, USA. Stubbie 11.2 oz bottle, I think I paid either $3.99 or $4.99. Poured fairly vivid orange color with some unpleasent looking floating sludge. Even with the sediment in the glass there was still a LOT of yeast in the bottle that simply wouldn't come out. I don't think this bottle is the freshest sample, but without any dates on the bottle it's difficult to make an assessment.
No head and no lace apart from a little film on the top of the beer. Thinnish in all respects. Not much in the way of body or flavor. There is a little bit of a sweet and sour thing going on, but I don't really distinguish it as mustard. Mildly acidic finish.
To me this is just a bit BLAH. Rather thin Belgian Pale, and I wouldn't describe it as ""strong"" in ANY respect. Glad I tried it, but in the bottle I don't think I would bother again, however if I saw it fresher and on draft I think I may be tempted to give it another chance."
Nøgne Ø - Det Kompromissløse Bryggeri A/S,Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),6.00%,bottle,3.38,3.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,6/10/2007,"Picked this up along with the Nogne Brown Ale at Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA for $3.99 for the 1 PT 0.9 fl oz. Relatively new to GA, they also have the Imperial Stout on the shelves. Having tried the Brown Ale yesterday, I was not surprised to find this beer also WAAAY heavy on the hops for the style. EXTREMELY bitter for the style.



Mid-orange color with brown highlights, some chill haze, a smallish head and a little lace. Aroma is inviting with a nice English biscuit malt balance and citric hops. I was hoping for the biscuit malts to be incorporated in the taste, but to be honest the hops completely take over. Light but satisfying in the mouth.



Very astringent citrus in the finish, which for me, takes this almost out of style. Quite dry. To all intents and purposes this is an American IPA rather than a simple Pale Ale."
Steinhaus Brewing Co.,Frugal Joe's Ordinary Beer,,,American Adjunct Lager,4.70%,bottle,1.53,1,1.5,1.5,2,1.5,6/10/2007,"Actually pretty nasty. Having had a whole bunch of GOOD experiences at around $1 a single form Trader Joe's, this was the first serious letdown. 



Head on the pour is good, but it fades just about as fast as I can remember for ANY beer. Gone literally in seconds. ZERO lace. A tiny bit of carbonation.



The classic aroma and taste combo of cooked vegetables, corn and mild skunk. Really quite nasty even in the context of the style. A drainpour and that doesn't happen often at all."
Trader Joe's Brewing Company,Trader Joe's Vienna Style Lager,,,Vienna Lager,5.70%,bottle,3.6,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,6/10/2007,"Another pretty decent hit from the Trader Joe, single, $1 a bottle recent haul. Nice carbonation, good head, but not a great deal of lace. Good clarity in the amber body. Good depth in the nose with plenty of malty goodness and sugar promised.



Pretty straightforward but done well. Toasty malts, residual sweetness, smooth with an easy finish. Not much to shatter the world here, but at the same time a well made and simple beer that represents good value for money and a nice example of the style."
Nøgne Ø - Det Kompromissløse Bryggeri A/S,Brown Ale,,,English Brown Ale,4.50%,bottle,3.75,3,3.5,4,4,3.5,6/9/2007,"Extremely interesting. $3.99 Green's, Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA, 22 oz bomber. I like the label - simple and very informative, mentioning Ibsen, ""spicy hoppiness of the new world"" (which I take to mean American hoppiness in a Brown Ale) plus some other info.



First off this is most definitely NOT an ""English"" Brown Ale. It is clearly an American version of the style with a LOT of extra hops added to the original style. Emphasis on the hop profile rather than the malt, unlike the English style which is the exact opposite.



Very dark pour and a lot of cloudiness. Not especially attractive. Some head and a little lace. The arom ais suprisingly chocolatey, with a strong bakers, cocoa or bitter chocolate powder smell.



Tastes reflect the bitter chocolate theme. Finishes shows some extra bitterness and a little floral note.



Glad I tried this, pretty interesting."

Much darker pour than many of the other Unibroue ""pales"". A peachy, tea-like color with good head and lace in the Westmalle chalice.

Plenty (and I mean plenty) of residual sweetness amongst the Belgian yeast and mild spice.
The best Unibroue anniversary for a little while - enjoyable."

This ""Blonde"" has an appearance that has a good head and some lace, but a rather unattractive Dubbel like experience (I hate that dirty, murky pond water look). Aroma is almost port like, but without a strong alcohol presence. Very nice.



A little acidity in the initial taste, but then comes a small amount of sugary yeast. A little alcohol comes through in the finish.



Belgian Pale? Well I suppose so, but from the appearance through to some aspects of the taste, this is not a typical Pale."

High, fluffy, off-white head and some lace. The body is an attractive, pale gold, lightly clouded and mildly carbonated combo. The tastes and the aromas are linked together via a over-sweet, artifical apple flavor. Doesn't seem very natural at all. Not much else present.



Quite drinkable, but only in very small quanties. Another Lindeman beer ""for the ladies."""

A nice, well made beer, and great value too. 22 IBU according to the label.



Very attracive, dark golden body with plenty of head and some lovely lace. Good carbonation. Very nice, sweet malty aroma. A little grassy hop and malt, all pulled together with a surprisingly big alcohol bite in the finish.

Having given this a 3.45 (overall score) back in 2004, this is now a completely different beer. It pours ridiculously dark (as did all of the beer on this visit, I wonder if they are using just ONE malt for all thier brews!) and it SUCKS!



No head, completely still and lifeless this is a horrible looking beer with a murky brown body. It has a nasty, chemical acidity to it and both the aroma and taste resemble a raspberry vinagrette. A total disaster. I sent it back and the barman said ""Yep, nobody likes that very much!"" Drinkability and taste should be zeros.



Undrinkable at the moment, avoid it."
Hilton Head Brewing Company,IPA,,,American IPA,?,on-tap,1.95,1,3,2,2,1,6/2/2007,"Had my first pint of this on my latest visit to Hilton Head in June of 2007. An IPA is apparently a new venture for the new owners of the brewpub (as of December 15th 2006).
This poured close to black, and at least very, very dark brown! Alarming at the best of times, but on the same visit ALL five beers that they were offering were VERY, VERY dark. Not a problem for the Scottish/Wee Heavy or the Porter, but the Wheat, the IPA and the Summer Blonde(!) were at best odd looking, and at worst just a disaster. I wondered if the were using just one roasted malt for all five beers! (The barman said, ""Yes, it turned out a bit darker than we expected!"") - No shit!
As well as the dark pour, the beer was lifeless. Very little carbonation. Decent aroma (hop presence), but the taste fails badly. Not much balance and finished dry and unbalanced. Ultimately I sent it back."

375 mL paper wrapped botlle, corked & caged. Brownish, tea like pour with a cloudy body and some chill haze. Some figs in the nose. Aroma is VERY tart and sour with raspberries, almost like a vinagrette. Taste is MUCH sweeter than the nose would suggest. Clean, balanced and a well defined sweet and sour sensation.



Finish emphasizes the sweet and sour theme and gives a final burst of raspberry.

Poured into an over-sized wine glass. Definite light reddish hue, and looks fine (thin). Classy color as the light catches this on an early summer evening on a deck in South Carolina. Not much head or lace (even with an aggressive pour) but some spotty lace left on the surface.



Definite vinous quality. Mild and tempting alcohol in the nose. Fruit based. A little more fruit in the nose, but I don't necessarily get any specific raspberry or blueberry. Quite alcoholic, but smooth and not rough around the edges. Quite dry and certainly a wine like character.



Definitely one to split amongst several friends and one to introduce people to the new side of craft beer. Once again Sam and the boys at DFH produce something that is absolutely unique."

VERY, very sweet and malty. Some alcohol present, but this is one large, malt bomb. If you don't like sweet, malt based beers you will not like this - I do, so it was OK. Even for me this lacked balance, and more than a couple of pints would be too much even for me.

I would describe this a combination of a Belgian Pale (some yeasty, spice and candied sugar characteristics) and a malt liquor (it has a oily consistency and is still very sweet with alcohol prominent). A little hop bite in the finish, but not much.

Frankly, very disappointed. This beer looked and drank like an American macro lager! Apart from a little banana in the aroma and taste I could have been drinking a BMC swill product.

Essentially this is an American Pale Ale with a splash of ginger flavoring in it. Very unispiring and quite insipid. No character apart from an obvious ginger flavor in the finish, but outside of that the background is one of the blandest beers I can remember.

Great looking pour. Fantastic deep brown color and a very nice, large and substantial head that leaves some nice lacing. 



Aroma and tastes are halfway between an amber/red and brown ale. Some dry character as one would expect from an amber/red, but also some nice malt which gives it a little more brown ale character. The smell and the tastes are definitely not huge (it's slightly light in its feel), but they are good enough to make the beer very drinkable and enjoyable.

Very cloudy, dirty orange pour with some nice fluffy lace.



Hoppy aroma that doesn't quite come across as strong in the taste. This is a very simple American IPA that whilst unremarkable, is still drinkable. I'm not crazy about the appearance (being so cloudy), but I can get past that.

Served way too cold, this couldn't be appreciated until it warmed up quite a lot. Thin, wispy lace, small head on top of the reddish brown body. Mild bitterness lingers all the way through with the malts becoming more apparent as time passes. A small, bitter, grapefruit finish. Pretty average Red, but OK.



I'm not generally fond of Abita products, in fact I think they are a pretty mediocre brewer, but this wasn't bad. Served under better conditions I could manage a few of these."

Looks good (for a macro lager). Plenty of carbonation and a decent head. No skunk, pretty clean, but indistinguishable from thousands of others.

Typical North American macro looking pour with some thin lace. Pretty clean beer with a little residual sweetness and a smooth mouthfeel, but very little in terms of taste. Very simple brew. Seemed to have a slightly green tinge to it amongst all the yellow ""macroness.""

Rogue Brewery (Brewer's on the Bay),Dad's Little Helper Malt Liquor,,,American Malt Liquor,7.20%,on-tap,3.55,3.5,3,3.5,4,4,5/20/2007,"On-tap at the Brick Store, Decatur, GA, USA. $4.50 a pint.



I really enjoyed this! Macro golden pour with a very nice head that left some pretty nice lace. Very smooth (no nasty skunk or edges on the beer). Served at just the right temperature and in the late Atlanta Spring, a couple of pints of this really hit the spot!



It is very sweet so if you are not keen on that sweet, malt taste then you should stay away. Also I would imagine that a few pints of this could give you a NASTY hangover, so treat it with care. Not a huge ABV, but the sweetness could repeat very badly in the morning. Has a slightly viscous look and feel, but not overpowering."
Shmaltz Brewing Company (He'Brew),He'Brew Origin Pomegranate Ale,,,American Strong Ale,8.00%,bottle,3.78,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,5/20/2007,"22 oz bomber, Jax, Sandy Springs, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Very light, orange amber pour with a fast fading, small head and not much lace. A little persistent carbonation.
Some fruit in the nose. Taste is a tart, bitterness with a hint of some kind of fruit. I wouldn't recognize it as pomergranate, but there is a sharp grapefruit finish to the beer. The astringent dry, bitterness hangs around for a while too. A little dry and mildly alcoholic in the finish. Some lingering grapefruit juice too. As it warms more sweetness comes through.
Not bad but the combo of the dry fruit, bitterness, alcohol and other elements (including the tartness) make this beer a bit too clean (if such a thing exists)."
Abita Brewing Co.,Andygator,,,Maibock / Helles Bock,8.00%,on-tap,3.28,3.5,3,3,3.5,4,5/13/2007,"Part of the $5.95 sampler at Wild Wing Cafe, Marietta, GA, USA.
Errr...Doppelbock - NO. (Subsequently changed in the BA database to read American Barleywine....errr...NO!)
Straw colored lager looking pour with some creamy white head. Looks OK. Aroma is non-descript and the taste seems to be a cross between a relatively high ABV Malt Liquor and a sweet Pilsner without the hop bite. Quite creamy in the mouth.
Pretty drinkable, but God only knows what this is supposed to be; Doppelbock or Barleywine it certainly isn't. Alcohol feel is quite prominent so coupled with a hot day and its drinkability you could find yourself in a spot of bother with this beer."

Pour is a very clear, urine yellow with good clarity and a small white head. Lots of carbonation. Nose and tastes have some rye character but it is VERY weak - very muted. Finish is dry and mouthfeel is rather weak as well. Put this against a full bodied Terrapin Rye and it's like drinking soda water!



I dunno, this seems like a half-assed effort at a rye beer that falls very flat. Grain characteristics, but no real flavor. Refreshing but very bland. A little over carbonated too.



Tried it once, that's that for now."

Love this beer. My favorite style, and this is a really nice American example form a super brewer.



Pour gives a lovely clear, rich brown color and an impressive head. Biscuit malts run across the palate making the whole experience a silky smooth, delightful experience. Plenty of body holds the beer together and as it warms it reminds me of a classic English Bitter from back home. Very mild hop presence lends a surprising complexity to this simple beer. Great stuff.



Off the chart drinkability for me, and a 5.00% it means I can enjoy quite a few - not exactly a session beer in my book, but a beer I can drink a few of with great pleasure. That's the key word - PLEASURE."

Nice looking golden yellow pour with a medium head that unfortunately fades quickly. Nose and taste have the Pils feel, but the finish lacks that typical hop bite. This is especially disappointing since this is advertised as a DOUBLE Pilsner. A bit lightweight all around.
Goes down easy and it is a refreshing summer drink, but for me this was a disappointment - not a bad beer by any means, but I was expecting more. I think Sweetwater can do better, and this is just very run of the mill."

No pop on lifting the cap, and the beer pours out as a completely lifeless, murky brown tea like color. I suspect that this bottle has somehow lost its carbonation completely or is just a plain bad bottle. Still reviewing for my own records.
Despite the lack of carbonation you still get the full effect of taste and aroma. Plenty of dark fruits and sweet caramel, all dressed up in a little bit of alcohol, but nowhere near as big as the 12.0% ABV would suggest. Sherry notes too.
VERY thin in the mouth. I suspect that this stems from the carbonation problem that I am experiencing with this bottle.
I'm guessing that this could be a high quality Quad, but for now I am going to reserve judgement until I get a properly carbonated bottle."

Pour is a light brown murk, with a nice head and a little lacing.



Typically light Belgian with candy notes and plenty of mild, dark fruit sweetness. A little typical Belgian yeast, but not a great deal. Slightly sour with a mild lambic tartness. Finishes with a whiff of sherry based alcohol, but very little.



Lightweight Belgian with an amber body that is a long way from Blonde or Pale. Mildly disappointed, plenty of other better Belgian examples out there."

Interesting, but not very good. 2.7% ABV according to the label.



Nice looking pour with lemon yellow colored pour and plenty of carbonation. Nice head and some lacing, looks promising.



Dreadfully weak aroma, taste and body. Reminds me of what it basically is - an English lager shandy. Virtually no alcohol detectable and a rather plastic, artifical taste - not even as good as a Shandy Bass in a can from the late 70's! A little smoke in there too? Sweet malts and some honey, but no lemon. I think this is because in Europe ""lemonade"" means Sprite/7-Up NOT ""lemon"".



I dunno, I suppose it is what it is. No more no less. Not really a beer, more of a kids drink. Drinkability is OK if it's 100+ degrees and you don't really fancy a beer!"

I've been drinking this for a few months now, finally got around to reviewing it.
Interesting beer. Has the taste (and aroma) of an English Barleywine up front (malty, sweet and fruity), but then finishes with a little alcohol kick and that telltale American Barleywine hop bitterness. The finish is sufficiently restrained to keep this in the English category, but it is a little more astringent than the typical, English version.
Highly drinkable considering the style and the ABV, and it marries two ends of the same style spectrum rather nicely. Good value too, I think I paid around $6.99 for a four pack."

A close look through the brown bottle reveals plenty of easily disturbed sediment. This settles quickly. Lively pour into the Duvel tulip with a good head that leaves some thin lace. Color is a macro-like golden hue.



Nose is a medicinal herb mixture with some lemon pine bathroom cleaner and a little Belgian yeast! Not quite as disgusting as that combo sounds!



The taste is VERY unusual. A combination of lemon, pine, soap, yeast, pepper and Belgian spice. Odd. The label mentions ""gin"", so I assume some juniper inspiration too.



A little thin in the mouth - lacks real body.



A very odd beer, but pretty interesting. If you like gin (as I do) you'll probably enjoy this, but I don't think anyone could drink a huge quantity. I like it, I bet that many won't."

Not much pop on the bottle opening, but a generous rush of fine carbonation still rises quickly. Poured into the Urthel goblet, it forms an impressive head with an atractive lemon straw body. Very nice lacing, a good looker.



Saison qualities all around, but light. Very refreshing. Fine carbonation and very mild hop presence coupled with the mild funk, almost gives this a champagne like feel. Finishes with a crispness that is classy. A light, citrus tartness completes the package.



Would be very nice as an aperitif on a warm afternoon, or even the kind of thing one could serve at a wedding as a ""welcome"" drink.



A delicate Saison, not as robust as some others, but a very nice addition to the light, summer drinks arsenal."

Pour is a bit of a lacklustre, mid-brown effort with a fading head and a tiny bit of carbonation.



Nose is pretty strong with a mild sherry like aroma.



Very chocolately. Lots of bakers chocolate in the initial tastes and this hangs on. Average mouthfeel and the chocolate lingers in the finish. Slight alcohol bite in the end that eventually overcomes the chocolate.



OK, but I wouldn't purchase again."

Grassy hop nose with a strange hay-like smell over the top.



Astringent grapefruit like bitterness, quite strong. Mild malts barely hold the whole thing together.



This is a bitter beer without much subtlelty. Not a very good Pils but I'm not sure if that is the beer or the Organic element that make it different. Not something I would bother with again, lacks a clean edge."

Typical American adjunct filled macro pour. Initially a large head that fades to nothing almost immeadiately. Highly carbonated with streams and streams of bubbles rising to the top. Bright golden yellow body.



Mild, sweet adjunts....and that's about it. No skunk, non-offensive and did a thirst quenching job on a late April afternnon in Atlanta in front of the grill at around 85-90 degrees. Won't buy it again but I wanted to try it once."

Given that this is the Ambree (compared to the Blonde) I was expecting a deeper copper colored hue than I got. It was surprisingly light in color. Huge, billowing head in the Duvel tulip, it looks pretty good. Some nice lacing.



Fine carbonation, slightly prickly in the mouth. Sweet nose, a little Belgian yeast. As others have mentioned, the label says 10.5% ABV and it certainly drinks above the BA database listed 6.5%, but at the same time it is not overpowering.



Mouthfeel is where this beer lets you down. Very thin for the style and a little watery.



Sweetness dominates, but there remains some dry, pepper spice. Decent Belgian Pale without the depth of a classic Duvel or one of the ""better"" or more classic Belgian pales."

11.2 oz plain brown bottle with an attractive label. Pours typically golden with a fluffy, billowing head - looks good. Smells yeasty, with typical Belgian Pale characteristics. Some mild pepper and hop profile in the nose makes you think this is going to be a dry, hoppy Belgian but the taste is MUCH sweeter than you would initially be led to believe. The sweetness is NOT overwhelming to me, and I suppose it is because of the honey base, but it doesn't really seem honey-like to me.



Smooth in the mouth and incredibly drinkable on a warm Atlanta afternoon - gone in a few minutes!



From the few other reviews here, it appears that some thought this was too sweet. I didn't, but it is certainly true that I enjoy the sweeter side of things."

Plenty of chill haze on the pour, probably simply too cold. Mid copper-colored pour with a decent head that fades quickly. Minor spotty head left on the surface.



Viscous mouthfeel and syrup characteristics. Sweet alcohol in the nose.



Sweet initially with harsh, biting hops in the finish. Like most American BW's of this ABV, it feels edgy, young and harsh. Also like most, I would like to let this mature a little before I could drink much of it."
Butte Creek Brewing Company,Butte Creek Winter Ale,,,American Brown Ale,?,bottle,3.68,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,4/27/2007,"12 oz single from Jax, Sandy Springs, Atlanta, GA, USA.



Dark, dark brown pour with a certain murkiness about it. Spotty head left on the surface of the brew, not much lace.



Sweet and malty nose which is surprisingly reminiscent of an English Brown Ale. However, very quickly this is cut through by the typical taste of the American version of the style. Very hoppy for a traditional Brown Ale, but very typical for the American version.



The hoppy, bitterness is tolerable, but toward the end of the bottle I was craving the original version of the style - nice beer, but I still prefer my English, sweet, malty Brown's."

Very bright, seriously golden pour with some good head and a little lacing. Lots of clarity - good carbonation. Much lighter color than most Bocks, but I think this is a reflection of the Maibock style rather than this beer in particular. 



Very flavorful and fragrant nose. Lots of sweet malts and a grassy hop smell.



Very smooth. Great combination of simple malt, biscuity sweetness, light hop bite in the finsh and a little alcohol edge. Very well put together. Reminded me of a malty/sweeter Pils with a darker color.

Kulmbacher  Brauerei AG,Kulmbacher Reichelbrau Eisbock,,,Eisbock,9.20%,bottle,4.85,4,5,5,5,4.5,4/22/2007,"Good grief. I think I got really lucky here. Picked this up as a 12 oz single. On the label it has ""Mindestens haltbar bis: 22.10.04"" which is obvioulsy a reference to October of 2004 either as a bottled on, or best before date. It matters not, since this beer has aged beautifully.



Dark, Porter like, noisy pour which tells me that this beer is going to be class. Brown with some light orange highlights. Large head that fades quickly to leave little or no lacing on the glass but a small, spotty head on the surface of the body.



WOW, this is RICH. Velvety and vuluptuous! Sweet malts and mild alcohol (it drinks well below the 9.2%) coupled with a silky mouthfeel gives this beer a perfect mouthfeel. Drinkability is also very high considering everything.



Huge Port and sherry notes in the aroma and the taste, but without the harshness that sometime accompany such brews. Mild dark fruits (raisins) and a little Christmas cake marzipan too. Caramelized malts and burnt brown sugars - it's a treat.



In summary: I wish I had a case."

I must admit I was a little disappointed in the small pop on opening - I was expecting more. Into the Tucher weizen glass. Pour has a light, golden hue with a slight cloudiness (chill haze?). Obviously plenty of carbonation and a large, fluffy and impressive head.
Aroma has a little Belgian yeast character (good) and a little bit of skunk (bad).
Taste is definitely vinous. It has a dry, almost white wine like quality about it with grape flavors and a very subtle dry fruit flavor. Very tasty and moreish.
Drinkability is HUGE. I was expecting a higher ABV for this beer, but the manageable 8% makes this a beer you could drink a LOT of, VERY quickly - take care.
I get the feeling that this brew could be used in many different ways. I like it paired with food (chicken and fish are the obvious), and I think I would like it as a potential apperitif.
Very good, worth a try if you've not had it."

Pale pour with a little too much yellow color as opposed to orange hue for my liking. Some half-decent head and lacing make up for the lack of color a little bit. A little grainy in the nose.
Looking through the reviews for this beer I get the feeling that there is a pattern. To me this is a decent enough, simple English IPA with mild hop bitterness and a tiny bit of lingering grapefruit in the finish. Good malt balance is present too. Unfortunately, many American palates fail to recognize the value or the beauty in a MILDLY hopped IPA! Of course, this type of beer is much more like the English version of the style that has been hijacked so often in the US.
Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the American IPA's and DIPA's, but in that mix, too many of these more subtle, less aggressive, well made beers have been lost and under-appreciated."

Nice looking pour, pretty deep brown color with a decent head and good lacing. Plenty of malty caramel notes, a dryish finish and some final bitterness. Smooth. The dry character makes this a good Red Ale, but the overall character is more reminiscent of a solid Brown Ale. Pleased I tried it.

Brown Ale type pour with a decent head - not much lacing. Brown and garnet highlights, a little less black than some in the style. Has some sweet malt characteristics and finish with a little bitterness. Nice example of the style, simple and straightforward. A little lacking in body, but decent enough.



I often look at the Schwarzbier's and feel that there is something missing from the experience. A little more depth in malt, sweetness or body would suit me better, but that's a personal thing rather than a hang-up with any particular beer.

Bottle is different to the style shown in the BA database - no foil. Surprised at the light, butterscotch color of the pour with some serious murkiness - also highly carbonated.



Aroma starts drifting across the room from the Koningshoeven small goblet. Has some sour and faintly funky notes - again, not really what was I expecting for an Old Ale.



As far as the taste goes, AGAIN not at all what I was expecting for the style. A serious tartness and a lingering bitterness in the finish. In fact, I'd challenge the categorization as an Old Ale. Creamy in the mouth, but not really what I was expecting and frankly this was not all that enjoyable or drinkable.

Quite a pale orange color with a little haziness. Nice creamy and frothy head that subsides to give a creamy finish on the surface. Very good, layered lacing.
Pretty much your standard American version of the original English IPA style. Pronounced aromatic hop aroma and a fairly bitter, grapefruit based finish. Dryish and quite astringent, this is not very subtle and lingers a little bit too long in the mouth. This takes away from the drinkabilty some and gives a mild metallic, coinage type taste.
It is what it is - an aggressively hopped version of a style that I prefer in the original, more subtle context. Highish ABV too, so a little difficult to really settle down with."

Dave cracked this one as part of an ""informal"" tasting on a Friday afternoon. Just as well, because at $40 a bottle I wasn't crazy about springing for this!
Attractive bottle and packaging. Pour is dark burgandy/browinsh with a lack of clarity, some smallish head and zero lacing. A thin film of spotty lace is left on the surface of the beer. Some large bubbles.
Highly vinous and woody in the very funky, farmhouse nose - aged Saison type smell. Taste reflects that, but has some mild (not overpowering tartness). Drinks well below the 15.5% advertised on the label so be careful.
Apparently this is aged in wine barrels and you can definitely detect a lot of that character. Thanks Dave."

Orange, chill-hazed pour with a nice high head with a little lacing in the Duvel chalice. Alcohol is quite prominent in the nose, but to be honest, whilst it IS fairly astringent it is also not overpowering. Obviously very sweet, but I get a LOT of tangerines and other mild orange tastes. A tiny bit of pepper too. Drinks below the ABV and can be enjoyed quicker than the ABV would suggest.
I don't see this as a traditional Quad, rather a super-fruity Tripel. It pours darker than a tripel but it has all the characteristics of a tripel - a lot of sweetness and a typical underlying Belgian yeast flavor. I like this, but I wouldn't put ths down as a typical Quad.

Pale orange pour with a nice head, some decent carbonation and some nice, simple lace.
This is a very nice beer. The kind of beer that revels in its simplicity and the kind of beer that the top US brewers are making way too few of. Some mild hop presence in the nose but not overpowering. Lovely smooth mouthfeel with a soft, biscuit malt presence that is reminscent of many bottle conditioned English beers that we get in the States.
Lovely balance of bitterness and satifying roundness and malty finish.

Pretty much pure orange color with a very fine amount of head and lace. To be honest, more head and lace than I was expecting considering the ABV.



Before getting into the specifics, this is obviously still way too hot. The alcohol is going to need at LEAST a year to even out and after that we are probably looking at several more years of great cellaring ahead of it.



Very typical of the American version of the Barley Wine style. Initial sweetness is tempered by a hot alcohol burn and wickedly bitter grapefruit and metallic finish. Aftertaste lingers and really bites with some serious alcohol warmth.



Some slickness in the mouth, but not too cloying. Not my favorite style (I prefer the original, English style) and I really should learn to lay these baby's down before I crack 'em - I'd enjoy them even more that way. Not easy to drink this young, and one of these over the course of a complete evening with three or four glasses of water is how I like to handle it."

Nice mid-orange pour with very little carbonation but a nice formation of creamy head and some sticky, creamy lace. Looks classically good.
Very hoppy nose - seems quite dry. Clearly a simple beer, but why such huge hop presence even in this simple brew? I understand the Stone/West Coast philosophy, but this strikes me as a perfect beer to have more malt balance, and at 4.4% *could* be presented and marketed as a perfect session, easy drinking English type bitter (even though it would NOT be any of those things in reality). To me, a great opportunity missed.
Despite the very dry hop presence, this is still a drinkable beer, and indeed a half-decent Amber, but the harsh, dry, metallic bitter finish and aftertaste is really quite hard. For me it takes away from the beer. More malt balance required to smooth out the hops.
I dunno, where's the balance?"
Unibroue,Eau Benite,,,Tripel,7.70%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,4/7/2007,"In English, Holy Water. Corked & Caged 750 mL bottle as a part of the Unibroue tasting at The Brick Store, Decatur, GA, USA. Not currently available in the USA.
Well, I'm running out of new things to say about the Unibroue range. So many of the beers are similar, solid examples of Belgian styles with much to please.
Beautiful light orange, slightly hazed color with a large, billowing white head. Decent lacing.
Characteristic mild, light fruits with the unmistakable prominent yeast character that follows in everything Unibroue. 
A little lighter than most and not a huge ABV makes this extremely drinkable.
All in all another solid (if somewhat predictable) Belgian style beer from North of the Border."

Classic English BW in all respects. Deep orange pour with little or no carbonation and minimal ring of lace on the surface of the beer (as expected).



Very sweet. Strong aroma is dominated by Sherry and Port notes. Alcohol comes through quite strong but this is still amazingly drinkable. Smooth, but with a kick in the finish. Aftertaste is minimal (a good thing I think). Plenty of caramelized malts and a little bitterness (in true English BW style).



No complaints, exactly as one would expect. One glass is plenty consumed alongside a large glass of water."
Královský Pivovar Krušovice a.s. (The Royal Brewery of Krušovice ),Krušovice Imperial,,,Czech Pilsener,5.00%,bottle,3.15,4,3.5,3,3,3,4/6/2007,"$1.99 Cheers, Carrollton, GA, USA. 500 mL bottle.



Looks good. Golden with some nice sticky lacing and some small but persistent head. Some pretty good carbonation in the Sweetwater 420 ""logoed"", Pilsner glass. 



Dry, hop aroma that is clean. Saaz? in the nose.



Pils taste, that is clean, but this beer really lacks a BITE. There is a serious lack of bitterness and not the kind of hop presence I look for in my Pils. A lack of sharp aftertaste.



Too soft around the edges for me in the style, with a lack of crispness and an average body. Lots of potential but ultimately it fails."
Molson Breweries Of Canada. Ltd.,Molson Canadian Lager,,,American Adjunct Lager,5.00%,on-tap,2.8,3,3,3,3,2,4/6/2007,"On-tap, $3.25 Taco Mac, Douglasville, GA, USA.I think I last drank this at The Maple Leaf in Covent Garden - MEMORIES! WOW, that brings back MANY, MANY HAPPY days!



What to say? Not much. Light yellow pour (could be any macro in the world), some decent lacing but no head of any description. Some spotty cream on the surface of the beer.



Mild corn aroma, not too offensive and just the usual in the taste. Just about managed to finish one of these, but it wasn't easy - all in the name of research! Keep it cold and quick and it's OK.



Fairly non-offensive, but as usual this is non-distinguishable and utterly forgettable."
Unibroue,Raftman,,,Belgian Pale Ale,5.50%,bottle,4.3,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,4/5/2007,"12 oz bottle. Currently not available in the USA. Tasted at the Unibroue dinner meeting at the Brick Store, Decatur, GA, USA. Several of the Unibroue guys in attendance to give us the low down on the beers.



If you know Unibroue beers the first thing you will notice is that this beer is by far the most easily distinguishable of all of the Unibroue range. No huge Belgian yeasty tastes that are SO patently Unibroue. Don't get me wrong, I love the classic Unibroue Belgian yeast tastes, but many of their beers are difficult to tell apart.



The smell and the taste certainly does have the smoked, peat present, but I think it seems stronger than it actually is simply because this is such an unusual brew for them.



Golden pour with a high head but no huge lacing to match. Good carbonation and some fruit aroma. Nice bitterness mixed in with the sweeter sugar notes with serve to round this out nicely. A thinner beer than you may have come to expect from Unibroue but in some ways even more balanced.



Highly drinkable, really quite refreshing. Very nice."
Brouwerij Van Steenberge N.V.,Leute Bok,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,8.20%,on-tap,2.7,3.5,3,2.5,2,3,4/1/2007,"On-tap at the Brick Store, Decatur, GA, USA. Upstairs in the Belgian Bar.



As Dave suggests, the silly glass and wooden block (like Kwak) means the kids love this without understanding the very average nature of this beer.



Looks decent with a dirty, Dubbel like color (that I am not fond of) and a nice looking (small) ivory, rocky head.



In terms of a Belgian Strong Dark, this is a very weak beer. Its main shortcoming is the mouthfeel, but the whole experience is very muted. It has a lot of potential but it simply feels like a watered down version of a style that usually delivers big time. Almost like a Belgian Dark Lite, there is a mild yeast presence, low alcohol presnce (despite the ABV) and muted fruitiness.



A poor version of the stlye that literally relies on looks & style over substance."
Brauerei Heller-Trum / Schlenkerla,Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Weizen,,,Rauchbier,5.20%,bottle,3.85,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,3/31/2007,"500 mL bottle, Tower, Piedmont, Atlanta, GA, USA.



Nice looking with a decent darkish amber body and some attractive head. Very light lacing, decent carbonation.



In typical Heller-Trum style, the aroma is a basically a side of smoked ham in a glass! A great beer to enjoy with your grilled or BBQ'ed meats.



Unlike some of the other beers in the style, I found that the smoke here did not really overpower the beer. In other examples I found the smoke to dominate to such an extent that other qualities were lost. Some nice malty sweetness that was unexpected and that melds well witht e smoke. A much fuller and more satisfying body than I was anticipating too.



I liked this a little more than I expected so I was pleased that I tried it. Another example of the value of persisting with a style that has been a little less than stellar in the past."
Broughton Ales Ltd,Kinmount Willie Oatmeal Stout,,,Oatmeal Stout,4.20%,bottle,3.7,4.5,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,3/31/2007,"500 mL bottle, Arbor Place Beverage, Douglasville, GA, USA.



Dark, dark brown body with some slightly lighter brown highlights and the extreme edges. Initial head fades to gives a small film on the surface. 



Very nice beady and cereal based nose in the beer. Good sweetness in the aroma too. A little too muh carbonation in the mouthfeel for me - it's a wee bit prickly for the style.



In terms of the taste there seems to be a little bit of smoke in the flavor, but the oatmeal/cereal comes through really quickly and in my eyes this is a really good example of a style that I am not totally in love with."
Coniston Brewing Co. Ltd,Old Man Ale,,,English Brown Ale,5.00%,bottle,2.35,4,2.5,2,3.5,2,3/31/2007,"Green's, Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA.



500 mL bottle. Best before 13th June 2006 so this is somewhat past the brewery recommended best, but I am still reviewing it for posterity. Usually I am not too othered by best before dates as the whole process can be some subjective, but here there does seem to be a genuine problem.



Huge, billowing head on the initial pour. Quite a lot of carbonation. Some chill haze as the light amber body form. Some good lacing.



Initial nose and tastes maybe give away the age of this bottle. There is a distinctly acidic feel about it and I suspect that the beer is beginning to suffer somewhat. Everything is usually great at Green's, but this beer seems to be an unusual exception. Mildly sour lambic qualities that I am sure should not be present!



Dry finish with no much bitterness. Biscuit malts that I was expecting were not present either, again possibly becasue of the age of the bottle.



Note to self: re-review a fresh bottle soon."
Private Landbrauerei Scheuerer,Moosbacher Weissbier,,,Hefeweizen,5.00%,bottle,2.58,2,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,3/31/2007,"500 mL flip top, best before 10/06. Single bottle from Tower, Piedmont, Atlanta, GA, USA. Probably past its best.



Honey, butterscotch pour but it has a weak, watery appearance and a very light mouthfeel. Sweet wheat in the nose and replicated in the taste. Mildly acidic (perhaps because of the beers' age) and slightly musty.



The head is way too airy and light.



A poor example of the style in my opinion. I wouldn't bother."
Rogue Brewery (Brewer's on the Bay),Brewer (JLS Release #17),,,American Strong Ale,7.30%,on-tap,2.8,3.5,3.5,2.5,3,2.5,3/31/2007,"On-tap at the Brick Store, Decatur, GA, USA.



Dark, chocolate colored pour with a small head but some decent sticky lacing. Certainly looks above average. Bready, hoppy nose with plenty of character.



Rogue is stamped all over this. Huge hops that give a cloying bitterness that is not subtle in the least. The hops cut into the finish and even over-shadow the relatively high ABV. I just can't seem to get to grips with many Rogue beers. Everything seems super-hopped for no apparent reason that tends to consistently knock these beers out of style and into areas that are not suitable."
Brouwerij Kerkom,Bink Blond,,,Belgian Pale Ale,5.50%,bottle,3.45,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3/25/2007,"$3.99 Green's, Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA. Purchased along with the Brune.



Poured into the Brasserie de l'Abbaye des Rocs chalice it sits fairly lifeless and deep, deep cloudy orange. Low lacing, very thin spotty film on the suface.



A little yeast, a little fruit and smooth in the mouth. A very subtle mild hop bitterness in the background (like a sweetened grapefruit) but it's not much at all. Certainly nothing like some others have reported, although the bitterness does seem to be cumulative as the beer drinks.



Refreshing and drinkable but not my idea of a Belgian Pale. looking for paler colore, a little more alcohol and more fruit. Not bad but I probably shan't bother again."
Private Landbrauerei Scheuerer,Moosbacher Lager,,,Munich Helles Lager,5.00%,bottle,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,3/25/2007,"$2.99 Smyrna World of Beverage, Atlatna, GA, USA. 500 mL flip-top bottle broken out from the original four pack. Best Before 10/06 (this stuff did not shift well at SWoB).



Pour is standard a golden color that looks a little paler than normal toward the bottom of the Sweetwater 420 Pilsner glass. Plenty of active carbonation, but a small and short lived head that ultimately leads to a very thin misty foam sitting atop the body.



Sweet, malty aroma. Sweet taste with a very mild hop presence. A slightly odd aftertaste that I cannot place in which the bitterness is raised. Nicely balanced. A refreshing drink with a pretty smooth body. A decent brew for a hot summer day."
Lagunitas Brewing Company,Lagunitas Lucky 13 Mondo Large Red Ale,,,American Amber / Red Ale,8.60%,bottle,4.35,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,3/24/2007,"22 oz bomber from Smyrna World Of Beverage, Atlanta, GA, USA. SWoB nips in ahead of Green's on this one.
This is indeed a BIG red, no doubt. Good clarity with the orangey/amber pour with some good head and some very nice, sticky lacing. Looks inviting.
Plenty of citrus hops in the nose and this is replicated in a BIG way in the initial taste. On first taste this seems like a big, West Coast hopped, resious, citrus and floral DIPA, but the finish cuts in quickly to remind you of the malt balance which is also large. The finish is actually alarming sweet given the upfront hop presence. Huge citrus followed by a devastating combo of alcohol and sweetness.
Plenty of big hoppy burps ensue - a great sign. A very well put together beer. Good work."
Brouwerij Kerkom,Bink Bruin,,,Belgian Dark Ale,5.50%,bottle,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3/23/2007,"11.2 fl oz bottle, Green's, Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA. $3.99 purchased in conjunction with the Blond. Notched label with Lot number ABDE showing and a date of Best Before 2/06. Some moron as written ""Belgium Beer"" on the label. That REALLY pisses me off.



Poured into the Duvel tulip it shows a huge head that is gone pretty quickly. Dark, dark brown body that looks very viscous.



Muted sweetness in the nose. Very mild fruits. Thin mouthfeel with a mild smoke element. Dry fruits present but the whole package is subdued. Finish is strangely yeasty and bready with a dry, bakers (cooking) chocolate ending.



I like my Belgian darks to have more alcohol and more fruit. This is a rather subdued version and I'm not crazy about it."
Mendocino Brewing Company,Red Tail Ale,,,American Amber / Red Ale,6.00%,bottle,3.08,2.5,3,3,3,3.5,3/23/2007,"Picked up as a single at Jax, Sandy Springs, Atlanta, GA, USA. Not sure of price.



Fairly lifeless pour without significant carbonation, head or retention. Light amber pour, muted aroma and similar attributes in the tastes. Slightly dry, flavor is low but non-offensive with very mild malt and hop character. Body is average and reflects the beer as a whole. A simple offering (good), but in a style that is difficult to get enthusiastic about. The kind of beer you could drink with pizza and not remember anything about.



Session potential I suppose, but lacks much taste, depth and/or character."
Brasserie Des Géants,Saison Voisin,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,5.00%,bottle,2.45,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2,3/18/2007,"$6.99 Green's, Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA. 750 mL bottle.



Well, this came out of left field to say the least. Like no other Saison I have had. Dark, dark orange cloudy pour with a huge, dirty, light and fluffy head that leaves some filthy lacing. Many, many degrees darker than any Saison I have experienced, in fact it looks more like a Dunkel of some description.



Thin body, and lacks any kind of farmhouse funk aroma. Atypical in that respect too. Not much to this beer, in fact rather bland outside of a very, very bitter finish (grapefruit and dry tea). In fact the over-stewed tea-like look of the beer and the tanin taste are the major features of this brew. Rather odd if you ask me, not really part of the contemporary Saison crowd, and in addition really difficult to pin down outside of that moniker too. Frankly I didn't like it much."
Brouwerij De Dolle Brouwers,De Dolle Oerbier,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,9.50%,on-tap,4.35,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,3/18/2007,"On-tap, Brick Store, Decatur, GA, USA. Thanks to Dave for the hospitality as usual, he generally gets his hands on one of the few kegs that make it to the US and he was kind enough to persoanlly deliver this to me downstairs from the Belgian Bar. As ever, served in the correct, thin stemmed glassware, it has some immediate fine condensation on the outside of the glass.



A dirty brown, Dubbel like pour with some great head and lacing and quite a bit of floaty yeast sediment. All the components of a quality Belgian are there with the aroma and tastes having the standard dark fruits and spicy depth. All the attributes are enhanced as it gently warms. A beer that definitely benefits significantly from the temperature increase. Alcohol is evident, but still controlled. Big candied fruits in the finish with less than subtle sweetness. The finish gave me a little warming alcohol as well as some surprising acidity.



On-tap this beer gets higher marks for me than in the bottle, and if only the appearance were a little darker and less murky it would be up there amongst my very highest scoring Belgians. Nevertheless, still a favorite."
Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),LongShot Dortmunder Style Export,,,Dortmunder / Export Lager,5.50%,bottle,4.4,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,5,3/17/2007,"12oz bottle as part of the mixed LONGSHOT sixer, $6.49 @ Cheers, Carrollton, GA, USA. The LONGSHOT six-pack just made it to GA in the last few days. Notched label suggests Best Before June 2007.



Lovely golden color with great clarity, nice carbonation and a smallish, but perfectly formed billowing, pillow-like head. Looks like a hgh quality Pilsner. Light and crisp hop aroma.



Very smooth, silky mouthfeel that is almost slightly slick, makes this feel like a much higher ABV beer than it really is. Crisp initial sweetness (almost honey like) gives way to a mildly bitter finish that builds slightly in the aftertaste. Mild lingering hop finish. A nice combo indeed.



HIGHLY drinkable and a very TASTY beer above anything else, this is another winner in the LongShot series. This and the Old Ale would make me buy the LongShot sixer again as long as my wife would drink the Boysenberry Wheat!"
Terrapin Beer Company,Terrapin Rye Squared,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,9.50%,on-tap,3.73,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,3/17/2007,"On-tap at the Brick Store, Decatur, GA, USA. 2007 release. $4.50.



Same great dark orange pour and some nice carbonation leading to a large, off-white head. The aroma on this is really very strong witht he rye coming through HARD - almost herbal.



Alcohol is quite strong and to be honest the beer still seems a little young. Aging should be an interesting experiment. Hops are big and the finish is really dry. This is the second year for this and I still can't make up my mind if I really like it or not. I guess I'll have to keep drinking to find out!"
Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,Red & White,,,Witbier,10.00%,bottle,4.38,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,3/16/2007,"Well, unsurprisingly Dogfish does it again in terms of pushing the envelope and producing a beer that is at the cutting edge of what is thought of as ""normal"". The guys that are guiding this company, and those that are brewing these beers are truly extraordinary, BUT in a way that many in the USA do not appreciate. Many US brewers are simply piling in loads of hops/malt/alcohol or whatever, in order to produce silly, ramped-up versions of classic styles that are frankly more miss than hit. Many of these beers are crass and in bad taste (in both senses of the word), but DFH continues to manage to walk the fine line between everything that is good in America/American brewing (i.e. entrepreneurial spirit and daring experimentation) BUT AT THE SAME TIME creating innovative styles that do not trample all over tradition (a rather unusual attribute in the USA and especially in US ""monster"" beers). Anyway, you can probably tell that I respect DFH a lot more than many American brewers for their ability to be TRULY innovative WITH class - it's an uncommon combo.



Back to the beer in question. 



A capped, 750 ml bottle, $10.99 Green's, Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA. (BTW, I think this should be a 10% ABV). Bottled 02/09/07.



A significantly red tinge to the copper colored pour as it sits in the Brasserie de l'Abbaye des Roc chalice. A nice, noisy pour with significant (if somewhat short-lived) head and some nice lace. 



A Wit ""type"" nose, but with a heavier emphasis on the spice.



The combination of spices and aging produces a smooth beer with a definite Belgian Pale Ale feel. Reminiscent of a ""light"" Duvel. Surprisingly sweet but finishes wit a mild hoppy bitterness.



A lovely beer that certainly has the potential to elevate beer in social circles and is typical of the kind of brew that can make our mission as BA's easier when trying to espouse the virtues of craft beer as an alternative to wine at the dinner table.



Rock on DFH!"
Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),LongShot Boysenberry Wheat,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,5.40%,bottle,3.3,3.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3/15/2007,"12oz bottle as part of the mixed LONGSHOT sixer, $6.49 @ Cheers, Carrollton, GA, USA. The LONGSHOT six-pack just made it to GA in the last few days. Notched label suggests Best Before June 2007.



Standard cloudy pour for an unfiltered wheat with some decent head (and retention). Mild carbonation amidst the pale, clouded gold color.



Aroma is a full-on artificial (kids juice) type fruit flavor that is VERY strong. Luckily this is not repeated in the taste which is much more subtle (just as well). The fruitiness reminds me of toothpaste or mouthwash, but having said that it drinks better. Very floral. I didn't get much citrus or much (if any) hop bite. Quite bland, but a tart finish.



Very light, crisp and refreshing, this beer would come into its own in the summer months and I would hazrd a guess that it would be a big hit with the ladies. Drinkability is good, but it apart from the fruit it lacks much character. A simple beer that is its strength and pleasure. I am glad I tried it, but I can't see myself seeking this out again."

The LONGSHOT six-pack just made it to GA in the last few days. Notched label suggests Best Before June 2007.



If I had to blind taste this I would have described it as an English/American Barleywie hybrid. It certainly has the big malt character that the Old Ale style should show, but it also shows an interesting mild hop bitterness. Plenty of caramel and some dark fruits - figs and other Christmas type tastes.



Nice noisy pour with some frothy head and a little lacing. Suprising clarity and some good carbonation considering the ABV. In fact for a beer close to 11%, it definitely has some life beyond what one would expect. Bags of sweet malt upfront in the nose and the taste, and a touch of alcohol in the aroma.



Again sweet malts dominate the taste, but there is very mild bitterness in the short finish in addition to some liuor like character.



Very nice beer, and reminiscent of the Double Bock from BBC."
Oskar Blues Grill & Brewery,Oak Aged Gordon,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,?,on-tap,4.43,4,4,4.5,4,5,3/11/2007,"On-tap at the Brick Store, Atlanta, GA, USA.



Dark orange/brown pour with great head and lacing. BIG hoppy nose that is reminiscent of the standard Gordon fare. Extremely smooth vanilla and bourbon finish which is the only hint of change from the original. The flavors are VERY subtle and light, and a testament to brewing prowess. 



Great ABV coverage and presence, with a smooth, sweet hop and malt balance, followed by silky smooth mouthfeel and off the chart drinkability.



Another great beer from OB."
Weyerbacher Brewing Co.,Raspberry Imperial Stout,,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,8.00%,bottle,3.58,4,3.5,3.5,3,4,3/10/2007,"Thanks to SilentSabre for the opportunity to try this.



At first glance this appears to pour jet black with a small coffee colored head with some garnet hues, but a closer look reveals a dark raspberry red/brownish color. This color is especially vivid when there is only a very small amount in the glass.



Aroma is a milk chocolate sweetness and a hint of fruit but nothing close to the strong smells that some others have reported.



Thin in the mouth, and that respect this is barely stout-like at all, so I think the Fruit Beer moniker is correct. The raspberries are muted to me. They cut in right at the finish, but do not linger. What does linger is the acidic tartness which could be from a number of different fruits. Some milk chocolate cooking chocolate bitterness too.



Interesting beer, but I would certainly NOT call this a stout more like a fruit infused Schwarzbier."
Avery Brewing Company,Collaboration Not Litigation Ale,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,8.70%,bottle,3.43,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3/9/2007,"22 oz bottle, $5.99 Hiram Bottle Shop - thanks to Matt (aka SilentSabre) for putting a bottle of this aside for me.



Pours like a Dubbel with that typically unattractive thin looking, dirty, mid-orange/brown pour. I dislike the look of Dubbels in general, and although this is not necessarily billed as one, that's what it looks like. Plenty of fine sediment particles present and some pretty decent carbonation. If anything, a little too much for the style for me. Not much head and not much lace. Appearance generally looks thin, and is a little disappointing to me.



Luckily it drinks better than the looks would suggest. Plenty of yeast notes with mild ester based fruit. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side for my liking and the alcohol is very well hidden. Finish is dry, yeasty and has a small amount of bitterness that you would not necessarily expect. Maybe a little spice too, but not a great deal.



For me this definitely lacks the depth of a Belgian Strong Dark, and is MUCH more like a Belgian Strong Pale, despite the slightly darker color of the beer.



Glad I tried it, but I want a Belgian Dark that looks darker, has a more substantial mouthfeel and has much more depth in general. Although the ABV is up there, I prefer something that shows the alcohol more. A bit lightweight for the style for me."
Lexington Brewing Co.,Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale,,,American Strong Ale,8.20%,bottle,3.08,2.5,3.5,3,3,3,3/3/2007,"Tried a few of these on a recent trip to Lexington, this was the last one in the back of the DBF.



Light orange pour wih complete clarity. A very reluctant head that has no stickability at all.



Colossal bourbon character right throught the aroma all the way to the end of the taste. Not subtle at all, and although it is quite nice at first it very quickly becomes rather tedious. If I wanted bourbon I'd have ordered bourbon!) In fact so strong and obvious I would almost characterize this as a novelty beer. The only other elements are a big warming alcohol and a dry finish.



I dunno, as a one off novelty I would say go for it, but for me the bourbon quickly becomes overwhelming and not something I am interested in."

Encouraging burst when the flip-top is ""flipped"", despite the fact that I know this bottle is a little past its best date. This has been hanging around in this store for quite a while.



The pour is horribly murky (fair enough for the style) but this goes beyond that and looks like a nasty Debbel crossed with pond water. Not good.



Big carbonation, but it is very light and gassy. Mouthfeel is weak, and this beer is too thin for me all around.



Quite fruity with a little wheat based finish, but this simply not a good brew. An odd combo. This doesn't seem like a Dunkel Weizen at all, more like a estery euro dark lager - quite odd."
Harpoon Brewery,Harpoon Celtic Ale,,,Irish Red Ale,5.40%,bottle,3.35,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,3/1/2007,"12 oz single from Jax, Sandy Springs, Roswell Rd, Atlanta, GA, USA. $1.39. Jax in SS is a long, long way from the best store in the ATL but the ability to split sixers keeps bringing me back in when I am passing.



Copper colored pour with great clarity. Small head and some lace. Fades quickly. Not much aroma to speak of.



Quite a dry beer with a decent hop bite. Good malts back it up, quite tasty. A pretty dry and bitter aftertaste - surprising. A little thin for my tastes but this is largely in line with the style.



Definite decent beer and lots of session possibilities."

Having had the 05-06 Winter offering and really enjoyed it, I was keen to get hold of this. Not my favorite style, so I was equally delighted to find it as a single at Mac's (saved me buying the full sixer).



Drinks well below the % ABV. A nice black pour with decent head and lacing. Standard aromas, but the taste was really quite smoky. I wasn't expecting such a smoke intense flavor, it was really surprising.



The usual coffee/grain/chocolate roasted notes, with the emphasis on roast! I didn't really care for the emphasis much."
Clipper City Brewing Co. / Heavy Seas Beer,Heavy Seas - Peg Leg (Imperial Stout),,,Russian Imperial Stout,8.00%,bottle,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,2/24/2007,"This was described to me by a fellow BA as a RIS wannabe. I largely agree. Thanks to BA SilentSabre for this sample.



Nice color (jet black) with some head (very small), well formed but pretty short lived. Some lacing.



This may be advertised as a RIS, but this tastes and drinks like a lactose milk stout. Typical, slightly sour tastes with a rather thin body for the style. Very light for the style but still decent.



Not a heavy RIS by any stretch, but a nice lactose, milk stout. Don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed."
"Lion Brewery, Inc.",Stegmaier Porter,,,American Porter,5.40%,bottle,3.58,5,4,3.5,2.5,3.5,2/24/2007,"Thanks to SilentSabre who gave me this a few months ago. It finally made it to the front of the DBF! Cheers Matt.



12 oz bottle.



WOW, what a pour! This looks exactly like a high quality RIS! Jet black body and the (high) head has the appearance of that mocha/dark espresso type head - very impressive to look at.



Nice malty chocolate nose, quite strong and is nice.



Some sweetness in taste but the mouthfeel is where this beer fails a little. I like a creaminess in my Porters and this fails to live up to expectations. Taste is a little thin and has a fleeting bitterness in the finish - just not quite enough.



Outside of the mouthfeel a nice Porter and an exceptional looker."
Spoetzl Brewery,Bohemian Black Lager,,,Schwarzbier,4.90%,bottle,3.58,4,3,3.5,4,4,2/24/2007,"12 oz single, Mac's downtown, Atlanta, GA, USA.



I wasn't expecting much from this beer, since my experience with Shiner has been average at best but its often worth persisting with this kind of brewer. Nice loud pour with a pretty lively head and some nice lacing. Head has some persistence.



Dark brown body with some rust/orange colored highlights. Some sweet caramel notes in the nose, but surprisingly you don't get a lot of this in the taste. I suppose I shouldn't really be surprised because even though this looks like a sweet, malty brown ale, its actually a Schwarzbier. 



Dry finish, a little acidic and sharp and clean. Not a lot of malt here and only very mild bitterness. Not bad."
RCH Brewery,Ale Mary,,,Winter Warmer,6.00%,bottle,4.05,4,4,4,4.5,4,2/21/2007,"$4.95, VERY substantial 500 mL bottle, Green's, Buford Highway, Atlanta, GA, USA.



Pretty unusual beer.



First off, it pours and smells like a pretty standard, English Pale Ale, bottle-conditioned offering that we get in the USA. One difference, there is a cloudy, honey colored appearance that is a little different. Lots of simple, sweet biscuit malts (as expected) in the nose and the taste, but then things change fairly rapidly. Creamy head.



There IS a spice element, but not in the way one would expect from a standard, malty Winter Warmer. It is a bit more funky than one expects - a sort of English ale meets Saison! MUCH more herbal than your typical Christmas spiced beer (cinnamon, nutmeg, all spice etc. are all absent) and it finishes pretty dry.



A rather interesting and nice change of pace beer. I enjoyed it and was pleasantly surprised."
SweetWater Brewing Company,Sweetwater Happy Ending Imperial Stout,,,American Double / Imperial Stout,9.00%,bottle,2.68,4,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,2/19/2007,"Following up on last years on-tap offering, the newly bottled version at $8.99 a sixer from Green's, Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA.



Excellent black color and plenty of (if somewhat thinnish lacing), but this is where the really good quality ends. Wierd, herbal notes in the aroma, somewhat floral and soapy. Hops way TOO prominent for the style.



This is an odd beer to me, at least in terms of the style. A thin body, very high hop bitterness for the style, edgy and not at all smooth. Soapy bitterness and all in all a pretty underwhelming beer.



I wasn't over-excited about this beer on-tap, and in the bottle I am even less impressed. Sorry Sweetwater, I love you guys putting out some of these seasonal offerings but this is a miss. Keep trying!"

Black body with some ruby red highlights. Some spotty lace on the surface of the beer. Licorice in the nose. Tasty beer but not really stout like. Good malts, but not much bitterness. A little thin in the mouth for the style I think, and in many ways this isn't really very ""stout like"". Quite sweet with a little alcohol in the background of the finish.



Expensive for what it is."
Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),Samuel Adams Honey Porter,,,English Porter,5.50%,bottle,3.95,4,4,4,3.5,4,2/15/2007,"12 ozer as part of the mixed pack made up of this, the Black Lager and the Brown Ale (two bottles of each). $6.49 at Arbor Place Beverage.
Looks nice with a high and dense head and a very dark brown pour. Sweetness is definitely there with the honey influence (in the aroma too) but this drinks like a high quality brown ale. Smooth, drinkable and whilst not exactly rich, still smooth and drinkable.
Easy drinking and simple, but certainly sweet. Not everyone would like this but I enjoy the sweeter malt brews. Not a great deal of Porter character here for me, but good nonetheless. Another solid beer from BBC."
Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company,Leinenkugel's Big Butt Doppelbock,,,Doppelbock,5.70%,bottle,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,2/15/2007,"12 oz single from Mac's downtown, Atlanta, GA, USA. Now also available in GA in six packs.



Good carbonation (lots of fine bubbles) and some small head; a little lacing. Good deep brown color with a slight tawny-red hue. A little alcohol in the nose. Obviously malty, obvious sweetness but an alcohol taste that is bigger than the ABV would suggest. A tiny alcohol bitterness in the cleanish finish.



Not a bad offering, and the kind of beer I could enjoy a few of in a session. Decent, simple, Doppelbock, a good intro to a different style for BI's and as such some crossover potential."
Brasserie Fantôme,Fantôme Saison D'Erezée - Hiver,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,8.00%,bottle,3.9,3,4,4,3.5,4,2/14/2007,"750 mL bottle shared with BA brickstoredave and Miles at the Brick Store.



Poured into a small goblet the beer has a very Dubbel like appearance. Very cloudy and typical brown, I'm afraid that is not at all attractive.



Aroma has a LOT of herbal content. It reminded me a lot of the Cinzano Bianco dry vermouth that was so popular in the 1970's. That drink has a number of herbs and spices listed as artemesia, gentian root, clove, and cinnamon mixed with notes of agrumes. 



The beer has a very distinct herbal quality that is very clear. A clean edge to the herbs make this an easy drinker. Pleny of the usual Fantome funk. 



This will not appeal to eveyone by any stretch of the imagination, in fact I'm not at all sure that it would ALWAYS appeal to me! It's a mood beer in my book and is definitely going to be hit and miss on many fronts."
Redhook Ale Brewery,Copperhook Spring Ale,,,American Amber / Red Ale,5.70%,on-tap,2.43,3,2,2.5,2.5,2.5,2/12/2007,"A pint of this was more expensive than a pint of Lagunitas Censored at Taco Mac, Douglasville, GA, USA.



Golden pour. Looks OK. small head, disperses instantly. Average beyond average in all respects. Strikes me as low quality and cheap. Mild malts finishing with mild bitterness. The kind of beer that is unoffensive and must fit the AB mold perfectly. Bland as bland can be. Generic APA in a style that already struggles for identity this should be called BLAH beer by Redhook.



NOTHING to report here."
Brasserie Dieu Du Ciel,Péché Mortel (Imperial Stout Au Cafe),,,American Double / Imperial Stout,9.50%,bottle,4,5,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,2/11/2007,"I'd been sitting on this for a while. 660 mL bottle purchased at Brawleys, Charlotte, NC, USA back in January of 2006. Michael was kind enough to get this from ""the unadvertised stash"" that he often has.
Bottled in August of 2005. In a unusually pleasing scenario, the notch system for dating the bottle had been replaced by what appeared to be a Sharpie type mark - certainly very clear, I suppose it has the potential to be ""false""? It cost $16 + change.
Having drunk some Oskar Blues RIS (the Ten Fidy wih the cherries) last night, I was inspired to continue on with the ""BIG stout"" theme this evening.
Poured in to the Brasserie de Abbaye des Rocs chalice (also purchased on the same trip to Brawley's) it is jet black in body and virtually opaque. Smallish head, but nice espresso type thin, fine carbonated lace and a thin film on the surface of the beer. Great looker.
Very big coffee in the nose, but even bigger in the taste. This is nothing if not coffee based. If you don't like coffee based beers and stouts, this is most definitely NOT for you. There really isn't much subtlety here. Dark roasted beans with a mild smoke finish completes the coffee immersion experience. I was a little surprised at the lack of alcohol presence too.
For such a huge beer the mouthfeel was surprisingly small. It would be a stretch to say ""thin"", but it wasn't as I expected.
A bit of a struggle to get through 22 oz on my own, definitely would have been better off sharing this one. Drinkability is hampered a bit by the overwhelming coffee experience which simply doesn't let up, AND has nothing else to off-set or complement it. I wouldn't mind trying this again, but it would have to be; (a) on-tap, (b) fresh and (c) a little cheaper for me to be tempted again."

Also previously on draught at the Brick Store, Decatur, GA, USA. Sweet looking champagne style, corked, caged and dimpled bottled. Rustic and organic looking label.



Nice clouded yellow appearance with plenty of cloudy sediment. Very light particulates, make this a cloudy gem. Good head and some nice lacing.



Great pepper undertones. The mild pepper spice is the undoubted strength of this beer. Refreshing and drinkable, a smashing beer. Quite a dry, sharp and hop based finish. Delicious."

Black pour with some dark brown and a few ruby red highlights. Not much lace, but a decent creamy and spotty head forms on the surface of the beer that is pretty persistent. Good looking.
Aroma has LOTS of sweet malts and caramel notes. Some sweet, sweet liquor in there too.
This is a pretty sweet beer with some smoke character. There are some real sherry like notes in there too, and if you were looking for a description I think I would call this an Old Ale with a little extra hop bitterness. Sherry and warming liquor notes too, but VERY sleek and smooth. No edge to this beer and in that respect a little short on Porter character.
I like this very much, plenty of character and lots of depth and complexity. A high quality product."

Let me start by saying a couple of things. I didn't think I would like this a great deal and at the same time, one of these is plenty in one sitting to make sure that you still enjoy it.



Jet black viscous pour with a large, dark brown mocha head. This is THICK, but considering everything, very drinkable. To be honest I didn't notice the cherries a great deal. Either in the nose (this is a weak spot for me when reviewing) or the taste. I think that is a good thing since it means the beer has not been infused with artiicial sweetness or fruit, and the whole experience is more authentic.



Outside of that all that you would expect from a RIS. Big alcohol, big burned malts, some mild cocoa and coating mouthfeel. Delicious sipper than actually got consumed a little too quickly."

Well, what do you expect? Uttterly bland with virtually no taste at all. In its favor there was a decent head that lingered much longer than I expected. Some scant lace and an ultra clear, very, very light colored body. Peppery astringent nose.



Nasty stuff, but I knew that before I opened it."
Mendocino Brewing Company,Eye of the Hawk,,,American Strong Ale,8.00%,bottle,3.75,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,2/4/2007,"12 oz single from Mac's downtown, Atlanta, GA, USA.



Light color for the style, with a nice amber/orange body and some decent head. The lacing is there but scant and loose. Some sweet malts and some ethanol in the nose.



Lots of sweet caramel malts in the taste with a little toffee, and the alcohol is low key - until the finish, when there is a blast of EtOH again. Hops are surprisingly muted for me, with the alcohol replacing the bitterness that I was expecting.



I quite like this beer, although it is definitely a poor man's American Strong, a Stone Arrogant bastard wannbee. Having said that, it's OK and worth a try."

HIGHLY carbonated. Enormous initial head that fades very quickly to virtually nothing. Head and lacing is thin and light. Butterscotch clouded yellow. Alcoholic pepper in the nose. Aroma is consistent with the style. 



Mouthfeel is the missing component here. Too thin for the style and a little too sour. It lacks the depth and the funk of many similar beers, and in that respect is mildly disappointing.



Main problem here is the cost and therefore the value for money. With cheaper Fantome available in GA, it's a non-starter."
Genesee Brewing Co.,Dundee Festive Ale,,,Winter Warmer,6.20%,bottle,3.68,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,2/3/2007,"Picked this up as a single 12 oz at Mac's Downtown, Atlanta, GA, USA. I've not seen this in Atlanta before (in any form) so I was pleased to be able to get hold of it.



Nice looking clear amber pour with an impressive pillowy, ivory head, a spotty film on the surface and some good lacing. Nice looking.



Some mild spice in the aroma, but much more pronounced in the taste. Dark holiday spice with some fruits, all supported by a solid malt backbone. Good bitterness in the finish. Smooth and sweet.



To me this is reminiscent of Sam Adams Old Fezzy. Not quite as good, or cultured (a bit more edge) but a really decent beer that I would be happy to have a sixer of."

Light orange pour with a small but persistent, bright white head. Significant lace, quite thick on the inside of the glass. An all malt nose with typical biscuit sweetness. Nice.



The tastes are more bitter than I was expecting and the mouthfeel a little thinner. A little drier in the finish than many of the style. Mild soap in the aftertaste. A little less smooth than many of the other English Bitter imports that we get in the USA."

Extraordinarily pale yellow body, and after a large head from the pour, this fades to almost nothing. Some small amount of lace left behind.



Typical adjunct style macro, but at least it's clean and fresh. No lingering aftertaste - good, mild corny sweetness - as expected and average for the style in all other respects. Could be one of thousands of others."
Mendocino Brewing Company,Blue Heron Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),6.10%,bottle,3.38,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,1/28/2007,"12 oz single from Mac's, Atlanta, GA, USA.



Hazy, lemon colored pour with (as others have mentioned in their reviews) perhaps a light tinge or hint of green - an odd color indeed. Creamy, piled high head with some pretty nice lacing. Appearance is nice.



Aroma - clean hops, quite astrigent.



As is typical for an American IPA, this is very hoppy to the point of being soap like. Very pronounced bitterness and drying, lingering aftertaste.



A pretty good example of the style, but a little too puckeringly bitter for my English IPA tastes!"
Pivovar Klaster,Dark Beer / Kláster Tmavé 10%,,,Munich Dunkel Lager,4.00%,bottle,4.05,4,4,4,4.5,4,1/28/2007,"Thanks go out to Penney for this - apparently this IS available in Georgia but I've never seen it - maybe at a place like Beverage Warehouse in Kennesaw where the odd, East European stuff usually turns up.



Lovely rich, red/brown pour with some decent lacing and some nice head.



Aromas are all sweet, bready notes - very nice. Very tasty with toffee and molasses sweetness. Some banana richness almost like a dark Hefe! Very rich, and the mouthfeel is the most surprising aspect of this beer. Exceptional for the style.



Very low ABV brings the whole thing together. A very suprising beer, one of those that is a delight to encounter."

I dunno, I guess it's the style but this doesn't do much for me.
Dirty dishwater (Dubbel) appearance, scant carbonation and a decent head, but it fades quickly (ABV?). A little lacing but not much. Plenty of sinus clearing acid in the aroma and the repetition is there in the taste. Highly acidic rather than sour and to me very little other character. Remind me very much of a rough scrumpy West Country cider without the charm.
The mouthfeel is OK and the alcohol is very well hidden, but this beer does nothing for me."
The Matt Brewing Company,Saranac Brown Ale,,,American Brown Ale,6.00%,bottle,3.7,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,1/27/2007,"12 oz single.



Delighted to find this at Mac's, Atlanta, GA, USA as a single (mixed sixer $6.99), I presume from a broken down mixed Winter 12 pack. I've had quite a number of the Saranac beers, and although generally serviceable, I was not expecting much. This was a nice surprise. I may be a little biased since this (Brown Ale) is one of my favorite styles.



Nice pour with classic color and a really impressive head and lacing. Very good looking. Quite citrusy in the nose. A surpise to start with, but when you analyze it, if this is an AMERICAN brown then I shouldn't be that shocked!



Deinitely an American version of the Brown Ale style. More bitterness than I would like, but it works well within the confines of the style. The mouthfeel is good and the finish allows the bitterness to fade to show more of the typical malt sweetness that one would expect from the original English style.



All in all a good beer, very much in the style, BUT the American version of a brown is less appealing than the English version for me. I am looking for sweetness and malt in my Brown Ales and this obviously falls short; having said that one of the better Saranac offerings."
Brauerei Pinkus Mueller,Organic Münster Alt,,,Altbier,5.10%,bottle,3.18,2.5,3,3,4,3.5,1/26/2007,"Not really at all sure what is going on here, like the other Pinkus beers that I have tried it's rather odd. This beer has a slightly clouded macro yellow color with plenty of carbonation. Nice head and some good lacing.



The beer is an ester-filled, malty and sweet bomb. It finishes quite acidic and with a mild hoppy, dry presence. 



Very smooth, quite drinkable, but where it fits into the traditional ""Altbier"" scheme is difficult for me to tell. I often wonder if the Organic moniker has anything to do with the apparently odd interpretation of the styles that Pinkus seems to apply."
Clipper City Brewing Co. / Heavy Seas Beer,Heavy Seas - Small Craft Warning (Über Pils),,,American Double / Imperial Pilsner,7.30%,bottle,3.95,4,3,4,4.5,4.5,1/26/2007,"12 oz single, Best Before Feb 2007.



I'm an increasing fan of these ""Imperial"" (or whatever you want to call them) Big Pilsners. I like the way the higher alcohol seems to sit in the syrupy, thick body and they really create a large drinking experience. This was a good example.



Really golden color to the body, plenty of head and lacing and a really sugary, syrupy mouthfeel evident. Sweetness up front, nice alcohol too. The higher alcohol Pils certainly detract from the typical, dry, hoppy clean Pils edge, but I enjoy the different interpretation. Nice stuff.



Thanks to SilentSabre for passing this along to me."
Russian River Brewing Company,Pliny The Elder,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,8.00%,growler,4.45,4.5,5,4.5,4,4,1/23/2007,"Thanks to zrrbrrt for the trade. Been waiting on this one for sometime, and he did me proud.
64 oz of pure hoppy pine! Light amber/orange color with absolute clarity with some light carbonation. A few bubbles but not much. Huge frothy head with some significant lacing. The lace is really sticky (that's one of the crucial things I look for in an American IPA), a nice looker.
The aroma is one that is difficult to ignore. Huge resinous pine, organic hay, grass, hops and other sweet meadow like fragrances fill the nose. Obviously the tastes reflect all of this. Sweetness is there for a fleeting few seconds, but this is followed by a massive kick of those resinous pine notes. A very small touch of mild aspirin, but it is tempered and fits in perfectly with the rest of the American DIPA experience. Some drying bitterness in the finish. Good hoppy burps induced (another GREAT sign!)
It's ALL, West Coast American DIPA, so you get all the good and the bad that comes with that, but it is typically resinous and high level in the hop department. Don't expect to enjoy this if you are looking for an English style IPA or if you do not like West Coast hops - simple, take heed."
Brouwerij Het Anker,Gouden Carolus Ambrio,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,8.00%,bottle,4.38,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,1/21/2007,"I've been wanting to try this for some time, so I was delighted to find it at Green's on Ponce it Atlanta, GA, USA. $6.99 (I think).



Corked and caged 750 mL bottle. The pour is interesting in as much as the color is very much that of a Belgian Dark rather than a Belgian Pale. However, once you get into the taste, the Pale moniker begins to ring more true than the appearance would suggest. Quite dry and light, mild spice and mild candy, and although nice, there is a lack of depth of fruit flavors in keeping with a Belgian Pale. Surprisingly light, drinkable and even mildly hoppy (or at least at little bitter).



Quite highly carbonated with a good, fine bubbled head, but it fits very nicely with the rest of the beer.



I really enjoyed this beer and was somewhat surprised at how light and simple it was. A ""Belgian Light"" if you like!"
Ridgeway Brewing,Ivanhoe,,,English Pale Ale,5.20%,bottle,3.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,1/20/2007,"A significantly different bottle label than the one in the BA database. The stillness and the lack of carbonation from the bottle make this perform almost like a cask ale. Despite the lack of head there still is a significant amount of lacing.



I get some buttery hops in the nose, and the beer is light and drinkable. A simple, hop based medium bodied beer with very little surprise in store. This beer drinks exactly as one would expect for the style and some may call it boring, but the power of this beer is in the ease of drinking and the subtlety.



Finishes a little dry with some tartness."
Brasserie D'Ecaussinnes,Ultra Brune,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,10.00%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,1/19/2007,"11.2 oz stubbie bottle. The label has been modernized significantly since the one in the current BA database picture.



Poured into the Brasserie de Abbaye des Rocs chalice, the body is dark and cloudy (Dubbel look) with a small head and little lace.



Wonderful aroma breaks free from the bottle. Dark fruits, sweetness and yeast overtones envelop the beer and this is coupled with a little lingering alcohol. The alcohol IS well hidden (after all it is a 10% beer), but it still finishes with a bit of a kick and some drying, harsh bitterness.



This is not quite a smooth as others in the style, it is really a grown up Belgian Strong Dark - it's a bit too edgy, a bit too strong and a bit too bitter. Nice, but a Belgian for the experienced rather than the novice."
Brauerei Pinkus Mueller,Organic Ur Pils,,,German Pilsener,5.20%,bottle,3.65,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,1/19/2007,"Unfiltered Pils!



Extremely light yellow with some haze and a lot of fine carbonation. At the bottom of the glass it is so light it almost looks watered down - literally. Good head and some nice lacing.



Bread like aroma, with a little yeast character.



Tastes are wheat based and almost Hefe like. In fact if I was drinking this blind, the combination of the appearance, the head, the lace and taste would have me thinking it was a Hefe rather than a Pils.



Perhaps a little less traditional Pils being unfiltered, but drinkable still the same. This beer has a creamy mouthfeel and is less sharp and clean than a regular Pils (and obviously lacks the clarity) but still works well. I'm not sure if that is associated with the organic nature of the beer, but it is unusual."

Splendid presentation in the pale green, paper wrapped 750 mL corked and capped green bottle.



Pour is pretty much as anticipated with a good yellow hue, some very good looking, rocky head and a minor chill haze apparent. The aroma, taste and mouthfeel are all rolled into one. A very mildly hoppy experience with a lovely silky feel but with an understated dry finish. The combination of bitterness and Belgian works much better than in, say the Houblon Chouffe, and this is just more subtle and a better put together beer. A little mild grapefruit in there too, and incredibly light on its feet. The spices leave you with no doubt that you are still drinking a quintessential Belgian and the beer comes together very nicely.



This is a beer that I could drink a lot of without feeling the effect. It's simply an unusual beast in as much as this manages to marry so diverse characteristics very well."
Oskar Blues Grill & Brewery,Ten FIDY,,,Russian Imperial Stout,10.50%,on-tap,4.43,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,1/16/2007,"On tap, The Brick Store, Decatur, GA, USA. $6.00
The beer arrived in a thistle type glass, as black as night and with about a quarter of an inch of dark, mocha colored, highly pitted, dense foam being supported by the upper surface of the beer's body. What I first notice is that when I lift the glass to get a good whiff, it appears as though the glassware has an unusually thick or dense foot. Closer inspection suggests that it is actually the sheer density of the liquid inside the vessel that is causing this illusion. This is literally one HEAVY beer, and I don't recall recently experiencing anything quite like it. Like Mike said, you can almost feel the mass of the ingredients in the glass!
The aroma is powerful with plenty of burned malts, mild hops and the requisite chocolate, toffee and espresso hints. The mouthfeel is certainly thick, but it does not overpower the beer. The alcohol is certainly present, but again is in good balance. Nothing is too much, everything is well put together and constructed.
This beer grows on you as you consume the glass and I found this increasingly drinkable considering the ABV and the style (not known for its ease of consumption).
All in all another spectacular offering from CO."

Acidic, citrus notes in the nose with some apples.



Tastes are quite acidic and almost cider like. Sweetness comes through after the initial surge to yield a kind of odd, sweet and sour combo. Thin mouthfeel.





Lacks the maltiness and smooth sweetness I was anticipating. A little too citrus and apple-like for my tastes. Dry hoppy finish.



I thought I would like this a lot more. I was anticipating a darker, maltier and heavier brew but got something that was really rather light."

Typical English Pale Ale (a little stronger in the ABV stakes), dark orange pour with a bubbly but not dense head - some sticky lacing. A lot of malt sweetness in the nose, very tempting.



All the usual, US imported, bottled English Ale (bitter) characteristics are present. Biscuit malts are in abundance, with some dry hops and acidity in the taste. Fruity and complex, this beer has all the attributes would should expect from a classy version of the style. Slightly thinner in the mouth than others in the style, but still a delicious import for those of us hopelessly deprived of these types of beers, and a long way from home.



Mild but lingering aftertaste.



Oh what I would give to taste this closer to the source and cask-conditioned."
Brasserie Fantôme,BBB Dark White,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,4.00%,bottle,3.55,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,1/13/2007,"Fantome BBB White



$9.95 Green’s Atlanta, GA, USA. 750 mL corked and capped.



Nice orange, slightly clouded pour with excellent high head in the Duvel tulip. Head retention and lacing is not great, but OK.



Aroma is very peppery and this is a pre-cursor to a MASSIVE pepper flavor. There is a mixture of mild funk, light grapefruit, slight hops and perhaps a little cilantro but the white pepper is what prevails. It’s a very prevalent taste and feature of this beer. It even extends to the aftertaste where the pepper sits on the end of my tongue, giving some extra tingling sensations. Light on the mouthfeel which is OK because it adds to the tart refreshing nature.



This is true to the Fantome brand in as much as this is a very unusual beer and I bet this can vary greatly from batch to batch. In truth, I’m not mad about it, but having said that, despite the fact it is such an odd beast it was still surprisingly drinkable."

I was in the mood for a Hefe - not a very common occurence - but I was. January in Atlanta and the sun is out and the temperature is in the mid-60's so I thought it was a good time to crack one. Unfortunately this came up short in almost every department.



Pour came with a decent head, but lacked the huge pillowing effect that I was looking for. Color was a little too butterscotch influenced (lacked the yellow color, had more orange). Nose was especially lacking. No cloves, no bananas and just a little wheat. Mouthfeel was way too thin as well.



Some Hefe character in the taste, but it's all muted and thin. I don't know if this is a problem associated with the organic moniker, but it doesn't really cut it for a German Hefe. Disappointing effort."

Presumably 2006 vintage, but despite the bottle saying that ""Best Before Date and Lot Number"" are on the ""bottle top"", apparently they were not - not on the bottle itself or the cap (inside or out).



A still pour, with a real nice dark brown amber color with plenty of serious red highlights. Minimal lacing and head consistent with the ABV.



Very little hint of spice to place this in the WW category. Without question this appears to drink much more like an Old Ale. Aroma is VERY heavy on the sherry and port notes (which I like). These notes are very much upfront in the tastes too, but the beer ends VERY abruptly and sharp with some serious bitterness. It is grapefruit based, but not hop based - extreme burned notes, almost charcoal like.



I like this beer, and I like the WW style, but I don't think this beer IS a WW. As an Old Ale it works, until the exremely bitter end. A slightly odd marriage of styles but an interesting beer, especially for the holiday period."

Light Amber clarity with a head that disappears quickly to leave virtually no lace or head. Aroma? Not much at all.
Some light biscuit malts and a dryish clean feel. Distinct lack of bitterness but a surprisingly creamy feel to the body. This is unusual to say the least because everything else about the beer is light and uninteresting. Increase in sweetness as it warms. Rich moutheel (considering) is surprising.
Well, I suppose this is a decent light lager, but what's really the point?"

$3.50 on-tap, Taco Mac, Douglasville, GA, USA. 
Quite light, but still a decent brown sugar golden color with nice clarity. Little head and low head retention.
Some odd kind of plastic/metal taste which is persistent and annoying. Dry and hoppy finish with a little alcohol in the finish too. Some decent bitterness at the end. I was a little confused over the odd, difficult to place ""funny"" taste. I suppose this could be down to a number of factors (how well the beer is kept?, age?, organic?, adjuncts? or something else), but in any case I found it off-putting to say the least. Without that, I think this beer has some potential and I would like to try a really fresh sample."

Lovely dark brown and noisy pour with a massive nose emanating across the room. All the spices are there, nutmeg though cinnamon through all spice through orange zest. Delicious.



Tastes are all the same, with a really good body. Figs, dark Christmas fruits the full package. 



Fantastic, reminiscent of Sam Adams Old Fezzy. I could drink gallons and gallons of this. Rock on Left Hand."

OK, first off I'm of the opinion that this fits much better in the category of English ESB. It lacks the truly ""brown"" appearance of a classic English brown ale (don't get me wrong it still looks great) and has much more of a dark orange amber pour with great, dense head and some really nice lacing. 



Very full bodied, smooth as silk, malts and hops balance and a really prevelant residual sweetness. The nuttiness is apparanet in the sweetness - super. Absolutely delicious. Biscuit malts are in abundance and the drinkbility has me gulping this! A great beer."

Very significant pop on opening.The pour is good looking with a cloudy orange pour and a large head. The carbonation is extreme and annoying.



Significant sweet Belgian candy and some yeast notes in the nose. The taste has a surprising hop base and all of the typical Belgian notes (candied sugar, yeast). I am not a huge fan of the hop influence in the Belgian style and it grates a little with me - doesn't quite sit correctly. It seems to cloud the taste and introduces some Saison funk notes. A bit of an odd beast.



I think that this beer lacks the depth and taste that a Belgian Strong Dark should have, and it drinks much more lightly. The mouthfeel is both too light AND annoyingly carbonated, neither of which help the beer in the context of the style.



Not the best beer in the style, but despite that still interesting."

Nice clarity to the reddish brown pour with a very nice head and good lacing. Cream wisps are left behind on the glass. Aroma and upfront tastes are thinnish but distinguishable as grassy hops. Immediately I think I am drinking an IPA rather than the BA categorized ESB. This beer lacks any kind of significant malt biscuit profile that I would be looking for in an ESB or equivalent.



Finishes quite harshly with a burst of fresh hops. Quite green, sharp and clean a nice beer.



Only complaint here is if this is supposed to be an ESB it horribly out of style for me. This feels much more like an American IPA (green, vinous hop profile) ad lacks subtlety, body and smoothness. Quite edgy. As an American IPA I like it, as an ESB it's all wrong."

Tastes are more typical of an English Barleywine than a Pale Ale. Quite of bit of alcohol upfront, and some dry hops. Actually quite viscous in the mouth - a little bit of syrup. Sweet.



Fnishes very dry considering the style.

Reddish, copper colored pour with small ivory colored head and minimal lacing. No spice, very little malt and fading hoping bitterness.



Very little here. A weak, very bland amber that at least resembles the style but lacks any depth or character.



Extremely average in all respects, and the fact that is supposed to be a ""special"", ""seasonal"" or one-off brew this is horribly disappointing. Pretty much in line wth the disappointing Abita range, which at best is crushingly average."

Despite this being available in GA, I only recently got around to buying it when I was in Lexington at the Liquor Barn simply because I was allowed to purchase singles. Take note all stores/law makers.



Very dark pour, bordering on a blackish stout rather than dark brown porter. Very little light passing through even at the extremeties. Some nice lacing.



First off a WONDERFUL aroma that is apparent the second that the cap is removed. Very big chocolate smell with some hoppy bitterness and a little alcohol. The taste reflects this with a very smooth chocolate flavor and some stinging sharp bitterness. Finishes with a significant hop bitterness again, a little dry taste and some lingering aftertaste.



In many ways this reminds me of a chocolate based stout.



This is at the extreme edge of the porter definition, and in my mind goes beyond it into some kind of stout/porter hybrid. Having said that I did quite enjoy it, but a sixer would get a bit tiring for me. Another very interesting Avery beer."

Also as part of a $6.99 mixed sixer from Mac's, Atlanta, GA, USA!



Potentially one of the better/best of the Flying Dog range. Great dark brown/garnet color with a nice size head and plenty of lace. A pretty good looking beer.



Bigger than I was expecting in the nose and the initial tastes. Plenty of malts and significant hop bitterness. Quite a package. Caramel malt notes and a nice finish. To me this drinks bigger than it's advertised ABV, but at the same time it remains very drinkable. A beer that I would call moreish and one that I could learn to keep around as a fridge staple.



Good effort from Flying Dog."

OK, I've given Thomas Creek every opportunity to come through and this is just another let down in a long line of let downs. Actually this was much worse than a let down, and I am not at all sure what this beer is supposed to be.
First off it's NOTHING like a bock to me. Medium brown pour with a decent head, but it fades quickly. The smell and taste are UTTERLY bland and weak. Lots of wet cardboard, some nasty plastic aftertaste and a mild bitterness. I have no idea what they were attempting to do here, but whatever it is they failed. It drinks a little like a homebrew where the brewer forgot to add an ingredient. It kind of resembles ""beer"", but it has no character or characteristics that would distinguish it from slightly bitter grain water.
Ridiculously light and thin in the mouth, I have no idea how this relates to the style. Bock? I don't think so. No malt, no body and no alcohol.

Nice looking pour with the dark brown body, red highlights and an impressive pitted, rocky head about half an inch deep with plenty of lacing. Looks inviting and well put together.



Typical mild, burned malts in the nose, nothing out of the ordinary. Thinnish mouthfeel (I like a creamy porter) with a lack of outstanding characteristics all around. A rather exaggerated bitterness in the finish too. Low carbonation (good), but a blandness that was just ""blah"" (bad).



Plenty to make me want to try this on tap, but not much to make me come back to the bottle. A good looking, if somewhat average porter that was not offensive but equally not especially impressive."

Crystal clear pour with a small head that disappears quickly to leave a ring of lace on the surface of the beer and a few wisps of low density lace on the glass.

Simple orange pour with good clarity, nice, rocky head and very good lacing.



A simple and effective English IPA. Good grassy, fresh hop nose - clean and strong, with the taste reflecting that aroma. Mild grapefruit bitterness, nicely balanced with a little biscuit malt that finishes dry and bitter exactly as an ale of this description should. Reminds me aof better cask ales, and the alcohol is very well hidden. Lots of session possibilities despite the price and the higher than usual ABV.



Nice job form Ridgeway, the kind of beer that I expect is infinitely better closer to the source, but still does a nice job bottle when we get it here in the USA."

Don't really know why, but I've passed up the chance to try this on several occasions and have only got around to trying it and reviewing after several years of not bothering. Shame, because I really like it.



Much more orange color in the pour than a traditional, light pure yellow Pils, and a bigger head with more dense fluff characteristics and good lacing. Nice looking beer.



Aroma has hops, but not astringent and sharp. MUCH more rounded with a fuller feel than a bitter smell. Mouthfeel is large and rounded and the taste has sweetness, subtlety and a very mild aspirin bitterness. That aspirin feel is a difficult one to pull off because if it gets to a certain level it is nasty, but this walks the line carefully and successfully.



Drinkability is good, and this reminds me less of a pure pils and more like a Pils and other lager, hybrid. I like the combination and it strikes me as a very interesting crossover beer with session potential too. Having said that it does seem to drink a little above the advertised 5.2%.



Rogue manages to stay away from over-hopping in Uber Pils which is a fault in so many its beers, and this goes to prove that without the heavy hand they can still produce a fantastic beer."

Pour is a decent mid-orange with a pleasing amount of lace and head. Nice looking.



Plenty of citrus (lemon) flavors upfront with eveything wrapped in a dry, mild biting hop bitterness. Pretty one-dimensional in my opinion with a lack of malt presence strikingly evident. Like others have said, a soapy taste present, reminiscent of Courage Best Bitter! Not bad, and if you want a simple beer then it's fine, but none too complex.



Dry finish and a lingering aftertaste.



No my favorite example by a distance, but at the same time a decent alternative to swill."
Three Floyds Brewing Co. / Brewery & Pub,Dark Lord Imperial Stout,,,Russian Imperial Stout,15.00%,bottle,4.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,12/24/2006,"Review #1000, December 24th 2006. 22 oz bomber, 2006 vintage, gold wax dipped neck. Poured into the Duvel Goblet.
Thanks to Beerinator for the trade as part of Xtreme BIF 39.
Pours jet black with a wonderful expresso like head that becomes a simple film fairly quickly. Milk chocolate color to the head and the spotty film. Perhaps the ""blackest"" beer I have encountered, but definitely not the most viscous.
Nose is all sweet alcohol and the initial tastes match that aroma. Actually a lot more sweetness upfront than I was expecting. This gives way to a big bitterness fairly quickly. The bitterness is a burned charcoal. Bitterness bites in the finish. Increasing charcoal and burned malts are present with a hint of hop bitterness but not much. A combination of early milk chocolate and then some later dark chocolate. The overwhelming sensation is a something burning! Coal comes to mind.
Mouthfeel is very good with a silky smoothness descending on the mouth pretty quickly.
Drinkability is not great, and this beer definitely fails to live up to the hype, but that's not at ALL surprising to me. All the nonsense about ""Dark Lord Day"" etc. is almost certain to raise the beer to silly heights that are difficult to live up to. Having said that, it's still a super drink that is worth trying once, but I would not bother making a great effort to seek this out again."

Cork pops with a pleasing burst, and the beer pours beautifully with a dense head of very fine bubbles forming on top of the Dubbel brown body into the Gouden Carolus glass. Head has a definite espresso feel about it, both in terms of the color and fine film it leaves on the surface.



Strong and typical aroma with plenty of dry, dark fruits, alcohol and Belgian yeast. Exactly the same is replicated in the taste with a lingering, round alcohol finish and some distant pepper too. The sweet candy also makes a brief appearance. Dry ending emphasizes the alcohol and fruit beautifully. Mouthfeel is light and silky - perfect for the style.



If you like dark Belgians I suspect that you'll love this, a perfect seasonal beer."

Dark brown, nearly black pour with a small, tan head. Ruby red highlighs at the bottom of the glass. Good, strong and balanced aroma with malts prominent.



Slight bitter chocolate taste with a fairly dry finish. A touch of alcohol, all together a nice balance. More chocolate in the aftertaste. A very mild roasted taste, nothing very strong.



Simple, quality product. Lacks a little body, perhaps a little too much carbonation but pretty good overall."
Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,120 Minute IPA,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,18.00%,bottle,4.83,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,12/21/2006,"Nearly two years since I tried this on-tap for the first time, this is a 12 oz bottle sampling, bottled on 03/30/06. Part of my haul from my recent trip to Lexington, KY, USA, I seem to remember it was around $8 for the 12 oz single from Liquor Barn.
First of all this seems infinitely different to my original, on-tap serving from a couple of years ago. While that beer was really just like a strong DIPA, this beer drinks much higher in the alcohol stakes, and seems much less like an DIPA and more like a super-liquor laden bomb!
First impressions are all about the aroma. It is BIG. It's all sweet hops, soaked in mild liquor. I get huge amounts of figs, brandy and plums and it is exceptional. After I have recovered from the nose I can get a good look at the beer. Mid-orange body, nice rocky head and some lacing but not as huge as I was expecting. A surprisingly large amount of persistent carbonated bubbles rise from the bottom of the Sweetwater pilsner glass.
Amazingly sweet and alcohol laden, but for me it's still good. I'd bet that many would be put off by the combo, but to me it screams decadence. Even I like to drink this WITH a glass of cool water next to me. MUCH less hop presence than I remember from the tap a couple of years ago, this version seems a lot less bitter and more like an English Barleywine - not the American version of a BW with silly hop presence, but the original version with mega alcohol and sweetness. It reminds me of a Gold Label from years and years ago.
This is currently a vicious alcohol experience, but remains amazingly drinkable. I'd imagine that many would hate this, but for me it's an extraordinary beer. Of late I have been a little underwhelmed by DFH (perhaps because they set the bar so high), but this reminds me of their greatness.
A GREAT beer."
Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.,Sierra Nevada Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),5.60%,bottle,3.03,3.5,3,3,3,3,12/21/2006,"Hard to believe that I have never reviewed this from the bottle, so here goes.
I end up drinking quite a lot of this beer, but it's really only by default. In the majority of bars that one finds oneself in much of the USA, this is often the only palatable option amongst the nasty BMC swill. As a result I feel it has a somewhat better reputation than it deserves in the grand scheme - some people rave on about it like it is some stellar product. I think it is very average.
Light yellow body, almost macro looking in terms of the color, and a light and wispy head. Some lacing, but not a great deal. Overall this is a pretty thin, average beer with a slightly bitter hop presence that is mildly unbalanced. Soapy bitterness is a bit too much and an astringent and tangy aftertaste is left."

Mild vanilla tones in the nose, nothing too overpowering which is a good sign because this type of beer has a tendency to go over the top. This seems relatively balanced. A very mild nutty character too, almost like a hazelnut sweetness.
Definite mild lactose sweetness, but again this is in check and manageable. The real weak spot is the mouthfeel which I think is a little thin for the style and the beer.
On the whole, pretty good. I don't think I could (or would want) to drink a lot of this, but the odd bottle now and then would be acceptable."

Frankly, very disappointing for the style. My Belgian darks need to have much more body than this, and unfortunately this has an acidity and tartness that is completely out of place in my opinion.



Pretty decent looker with a nice tan head and burgandy body. Not much lace, and the head dies quickly - rather too carbonated for the style.



Nose reveals a yeasty fruit, but it lacks the real depth that one would expect. Not much there. The tastes continue the theme. Yeast, acid and a lack of fruit depth. This drinks MUCH closer to an Oud Bruin with a thin body and a tartness all the way through. Not at all what I am looking for in the style. This is especially true considering this is a Christmas/Winter brew.

My understanding is that this beer is called ""Light"" to help it sell amongst the BMC crowd, and it is not supposed to be a ""Light Lager"" - HOWEVER, quite frankly it looks (mega pale), smells (nothing much going on) and tastes (blah) very much like a mass produced, light, BMC lager. There is certainly a little more taste, body and mouthfeel than your average macro swill product, and it's drinkability is igher, but it's close.

Jet black pour with some orange highlights at the extremeties. Nice milk chocolate head froms which provides good lace.



A mild funk in the aroma that I suppose is the lactose/cream element but it smells a little odd - slightly sour. Taste reflects the style but lacks any serious sweetness and the lactos element seems to have turned to mild cheese in my sample!



Doesn't really do it for me, the beer lacks a certain depth and taste. Not bad, just not up to the usual high standards that we have come to expect from Bell's."

Everything about this beer says ""light"". I actually like it, but if you are looking for an English Pale with good levels of bitterness and malt backbone then I think you will be a little disappointed. If, on the other hand, you would like a watered down version of the style, then this will hit the spot.



Very light color (a watery orange) and a sweetish malt nose. Distinct lack of bitterness throughout the drink.



Significant lack of head, but some lace, there is a lot of mild sweetness about this beer.



Good drinkability and DEFINITE session potential (I mean pints and pints and pints). In the final analysis this is an easy drinking, mild, sweet and non-bitter beer that can act as a thirst quencher. I'd say a good summer beer."

Turbid tan, brown pour with some head and lace, but only as a result of an aggressive pour. As others have noted the aroma was special - deep cherries, and it is very natural. Not artificial and sweet, but really genuine.



A lot of sweetness in the initial tastes but this quickly gives way to a sharp, cherry based tart finish. The tart finish seems to stick in the throat a bit and is quite astrigent. Mild heartburn results. The whole package is a bit too reminiscent of cough syrup for my liking, including the body which is not much fun.



Definitely glad that I tried it, but I don't think I would bother again and under no circumstances is this an easy drinker. Perhaps a small glass with desert once a year, but as a ""beer"" this is not really a go. Can you say ""Marinade""?"

Chill hazed mid-orange pour with no head or lacing. 



I get blue cheese and other cheese notes in the arom and taste. What that is all about I don't know - perhaps it's part of the ""West Coast"" angle on a Hefe that is mentioned on the label. Frankly a piss poor Hefe and pretty weak beer all around. I wouldn't bother if I were you."
Tommyknocker Brewery,Cocoa Porter Winter Warmer,,,American Porter,5.70%,on-tap,1.7,3.5,2,1.5,1.5,1.5,12/9/2006,"Oh dear.
I first saw this in Atlanta a few weeks ago at the Taco Mac in Marietta and at that time the barman advised me against it since he thought it was sour or perhaps even off. I avoided it then, but a couple of weeks later a barman gave me a taster at the Decatur Taco Mac. I thought it still tasted very sour and it seemed very, very thin.
So, fast forward to today and I find myself at Taco Mac in Douglasville which had just got this in yesterday, and I finally decided I should order it and try it properly for myself - a mistake.
Looks are not bad with some thin lacing and a decent brown body. Mouthfeel is the real problem here. Woefully weak and completely lacking any kind of substance for a Porter. The tastes are not much better. A distinct acid/apple acidity, much like an infected beer. Sour and weak, a poor effort.
Mild cocoa or coffee aftertaste but it remins an afterthought.
Not good at all."
St. Peter's Brewery Co Ltd,St. Peter's India Pale Ale,,,English India Pale Ale (IPA),4.90%,bottle,4.15,3,4,4,4,5,12/8/2006,"As far as I can tell this is relatively new to the US. The St. Peter's ""flask"" bottle remains a classic. Green's, Ponce de Leon, Atlanta, GA, USA.



I suspect that this beer is going to be horribly misuderstood in the USA. People without the knowledge or experience of an ENGLISH IPA will think that this is just too light and not hoppy enough. The mistake that they will be making is that the English (original) version of the IPA is always going to be more balanced and understated, without feeling the need to shove the hops down your throat.



Orange pour with some scant lacing and a disappointing lack of head. Not the best looking beer I've ever seen. Simple malt and hop balance in the nose and the taste. Biscuit flavors in the background. Mild citrus peel and zest make up the bitterness, and as expected not a huge hop profile.



Too me this is amazingly drinkable, beautfully balanced, tasty and sessionable. I bet many will get it wrong and slam this beer for being something that it is not supposed to be."

Thinnish looking pour, but nice lacing. A little spotty head left. Body is a ruddy, red brown.
Not much coffee in either the aroma or the taste, but there is some coffee-like residual bitterness in the finish. Body is pretty thin, but this doesn't detract from the experience too much. Definitely over-carbonated for the style, but again this doesn't seeem to matter too much.
A stout? Well, I guess so, but the lack of body leaves me with a little doubt. The bitterness (surprisingly not via Coffee) is there."
Bluegrass Brewing Company,Jefferson's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Stout,,,American Double / Imperial Stout,8.50%,bottle,2.03,2.5,2,2,2,2,12/2/2006,"Thanks go out to BEERchitect for the chance to try this one. 12 oz bottle. Dark brown body with no lacing and virtually no head.



Don't really get this on a number of fronts. If this is 11% I'm a Dutchman. It drinks nowhere near that. Secondly this is amazingly light to drink - even to the point of having no body. Dry tastes with a VERY mild bourbon taste somewhere in the deep, deep background. 



I can't beleive that a beer that has the words, ""Reserve"", ""Bourbon"", ""Stout"", ""Double"" and ""11%"" in the description was so weak and light.



Considering the style and a number of other factors, a really rather disappointing beer."
Brasserie de l'Abbaye du Val-Dieu,Val-Dieu Grand Cru,,,Quadrupel (Quad),10.50%,bottle,4.55,4.5,4,4.5,5,5,12/2/2006,"I am adding this beer since I feel sure it is a ""new"" version of the Winter offering from Val-Dieu.



Beautiful pour with initially what looks like an almost black pour, but becomes more brown as the contents of the Val-Dieu chalice are emptied. Nice head, good sticky lacing and plenty of that spotty, creamy head that you are looking for in the style. 



Aroma is yeasty alcohol, almost ""meaty""! Tastes reflect a typical, high quality Belgian Dark/Quad. Layer after layer of alcohol, dark plummy and fig based fruits. Candied sugar and yeasts back up the package. Full and silky mouthfeel - absolutely perfect. Soft and smooth, it exudes and feels like a wonderfully quality product.



Drinkability is OFF the chart for me! I could drink this in pints (at least for about 30 minutes) before I fell over. The 750 mL bottle has disappeared in minutes! GULP!"
Rogue Brewery (Brewer's on the Bay),Monk Madness (JLS Release #18),,,American Strong Ale,7.40%,bottle,4.25,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,12/2/2006,"Interesting.



22 oz Bomber, Green's, Buford, Atlanta, GA, USA.



First off there is nothing ""Belgian"" about this, nor is there much that makes it a Brown Ale. Typical for Rogue the hops are upfront, huge and out of balance. In this beer the hop presence is ridiculous for a Brown Ale, but not too overwhelming when you consider the Rogue style. Often Rogue can get completely out of hand, here it's just big.



This is really a Bitter, or perhaps even close to an Irish/Amber, but either way it's very hoppy. GREAT lacing with a nice, persistent head. Red clarity in the pour - simple, but really good looking.



In terms of the aroma and taste I could be drinking a souped up English bitter - added hops, ABV and bitterness, but you can feel a simple biscuit malt base underneath. Take a typical English Pale Ale/Bitter and ""Imperialize"" it, and you have this beer.



I think it would get tiring after a while, but a nice beer in small quantities. Definitely lacks sessionable qualities, but an interesting Rogue offering. One where their typical over-hopping doesn't kill the experience for me."

Good black color with some dark brown highlights at the extreme edges. Nice looking pour with a very good creamy head that lasts well, with some latte coffee type lacing. 



There's a real creamy sweetness about this beer, and a distinct lack of bitterness. VERY mild, sweet and ""lactose like"" considering the style. In fact the more I drink it, the more lactose notes that creep in. 



Slightly lighter body than one would expect for a RIS, but this does not detract from the enjoyment of the beer. Clean aftertaste, very tasty.



Milk chocolate finish and much more refreshing than this style otherwise should be. Not your typical RIS, a bit more like a souped up (double? or Imperial?) Milk Stout. Nice."

Solid offering of the style. Pour is really dark brown. Small head with very little lacing. Plenty of mild, smoky malts. Delicious. Good caramel malts apparent too.



Good bitterness and malt balance with some chocolate and some mild coffee notes."

Very fizzy pour indeed. Noisy effervesence. Large, light head disappears very quickly to reveal a typical macro pour. Light and golden body with rising bubbles.



Stacks of corny, grainy aroma and tastes this is basically a standard American macro. Clean and dry, very little bitterness, just a simple macro type lager. I guess it could be just about any macro, but at least it's simple and non-offensive (unlike some)."

Very lively and loud pour produces great lacing and a lovely, deep, pillow like ivory head. Body color is a cloudy orange amber, but perhaps not quite as dark as I would like to see. Very nice sweet, malty and nutty aroma.



Tastes are true to the style with plenty of malt and noticeable sweetness and tangy nut taste.



Very easy to drink and rather tasty. If you like Brown Ales (as I do) I think you will probably enjoy this very much."

Not my favourite style, but I am happy to persist! Typically cloudy orange pour with some chill haze. The lacing is a sticky treat, much like a top quality IPA. Not much head though except a small covering of white foam.



Plenty of sweetness with a bitter finish, pretty ordinary, but to be honest that's just the way I see (and often find) this style. It's very unoffensive, quite simple and rather ordinary but drinkable and OK. Good quality, steady craft product."
"Bell's Brewery, Inc.",Hell Hath No Fury Ale,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,7.70%,bottle,3.6,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,11/26/2006,"12 oz bottle, batch 7673, purchased as a single from Liquor Barn, Lexington, KY, USA.



Basically a black pour with a very coffee/tan colored light, spotty head. Very little lacing, almost a stout like appearance. A bit too dark for the style I think. Quite a lot of very fine sediment suspended in the body of the beer as it sits in the Duvel tulip.



Aroma is light Belgian candy sweetness and some alcohol. Aroma carries through to the taste with some alcohol but rather a lot of roasted bitterness too. A little too bitter for the style I felt, and there is a lack of Belgian yeast and sweet candied character. Having said that it is still very tasty, perhaps just a little out of style.



An American version of a Belgian Strong Dark with too much hop presence for my liking, to the point of taking it a little out of style. Despite that I still enjoyed drinking it, just don't expect a typical Belgian Dark Ale."
Red Brick Brewing Company,Wizard's Hat Brew (Mellow Mushroom),,,American Pale Ale (APA),?,on-tap,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,11/26/2006,"OK, origins of this are not really very clear, but the best I can come up with is this;



ABC have been contract brewing a beer for a group of restaurants in the Atlanta area, noteably the Pie Bar, for some time. The Pie Bar has been marketing this as ""Numbers Ale"", but to my knowledge ABC has never sold this as such. Anyway, the word is that ABC are attempting to create a beer that they can market to groups of restaurants, namely Pizza joints, BBQ places and Mexican restaurants and each case it is likely to be a tweaked version of ""Numbers Ale"".



I drank a couple of pints of this at the Mellow Mushroom in Douglasville, GA, USA. I know that they (MM) are experimenting with this to see how well it sells, with the view to making this a much more permanent fixture. 



Mid orange color with decent head retention and some mild lacing, the beer looks like a typical APA (I don't know how MM/Pie Bar/ABC are actually classifying this, but I'm going with APA for now). Very mild grapefruit hop bitterness and a simple but well constructed malt profile. Very inoffensive, non-filling and a simple pleasure.



Nothing much to report here other than another typical ABC brew. Pretty solid offering, and nice to know that MM continues to promote and encourage local, craft products."

Classic dark brown body with some nice lacing and some good creamy head retention. Mild lacing - good looker. 



Excellent bitterness. Nice malts and the bitterness is NOT a hop based one, rather a dry roastiness. Finish with some lingering bitter dry character. Quite a high ABV for the style, but that is not a problem, it's hidden very well. Drinkability is high, a very nice beer.



Fine example of the style, especially pleasing to be coming from an American brewer. Worth a try."
Bluegrass Brewing Company,Professor Gesser's Mind Numbing Ale,,,American IPA,7.10%,bottle,4.03,4.5,4,4,4,4,11/25/2006,"Thanks to BEERchitect for the opportunity to try this one. 750 mL bottle with gold foil capped neck.



Very big and bold pour with stacks and stacks of large head and plenty of wonderful lacing. Clouded orange body. Aroma is that of robust citrus hops and some significant sweetness.



Good solid hop bitterness with some serious resinous grapefruit tastes. The malt backbone is significant and manages to hold the whole thing together. This is MUCH bigger than your average IPA and is getting into DIPA territory. Lots of bottle conditioned yeast in the pour."
Shmaltz Brewing Company (He'Brew),He'Brew Monumental Jewbelation (10),,,American Brown Ale,10.00%,bottle,3.93,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,11/24/2006,"22oz Bomber, Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA.



This is a big beer all around. Very dark red pour with nice ruby highlights. Very bold upfront in all aspects - aroma, bitterness, malts, alcohol and general character. Great head and persistent nice lacing.



This skates at the very edge for me. Reminiscent of a cross between a Stone Double Bastard and Terrapin BHM. Lots of hyped-up amber/red character (quite dry), but it also hits hard in the American Strong Ale tradition.



A sweet and sour experience with all kinds of things going on. Rather complex, but the complexity is a little overshadowed by the alcohol and the hop bitterness. This beer is right at the edge of being huge and hugely delicious, and being a bit of a mess. I found that each mouthful seemed to give me bits of both!"

Pours still, as expeced, to reveal a lovely, simple light amber body.



Alcohol in the nose is huge - also as expected. Very strong, almost medicinal or chemical.



Tastes are better and smoother than the aroma would suggest. No real burn which is amazing considering everything. Drinkability is good when taken in terms of the beer and the fruit character comes through more than I expected."

Great looking pour with mild carbonation but a super large frothy head and some nice lacing.



Aroma is a dry, laer/cider smell. Some apples.



Tastes are EXTREMELY fruity. I was amazed at the amount of flavor that was here. A mildly tart, cranberry and apple sweetness. Very tasty. Taste is not too dry.



Quite light. The more you drink of this the better it is."

Good dark brown pour with some serious red highlights. Small head that quickly pulls back to a spotty lace and watery top to the body. Lacing is present but a bit too light - no sticky component.



A little light in the mouth I thought. Lacks the big malts and chewy body that I would like to experience. Some caramel notes and a touch of malt, but I felt that the whole beer was just a tad too light.



Finish is mildy acidic but has a pleasing bitterness.



One of my favorite style, but I was left wanting a little more. Not a bad beer by any stretch, but there seemed to be *something* lacking."

In the store, at first glance this looks like it is probably a Schwarzbier but closer inspection of the label reveals it is indeed a Dunkel.



Excellent appearance with the requisite dark, cloudy body and a huge head. Poured into the Tucher Weizen 0.5L glass this looks very good.



Aroma is very rich in bananas. Tastes reveal mild bananas and some mild carbonation. Mouthfeel is a little thin for my liking, and this is the weakest point of the beer. Creamy to some extent, but it's not big.



Not my favorite style (although it's growing on me), but a pretty decent example."
Kiuchi Brewery,Hitachino Nest Celebration Ale,,,Winter Warmer,9.00%,bottle,2.25,4,2,2,3.5,2,11/21/2006,"Well this is a very odd beast. Bought as a single stubbie from Green's, Ponce de Leon, Atlanta, GA, USA.



Pours like an American strong ale - reminiscent of a Double Bastard. Hazed amber body with a dense, light coffee colored head and some decent lacing. Aroma and tastes are ethanal (apple) infected. Alcohol is evident but the apple funk is very off putting. No spice of any description and if you are expecting a WW of some description you'll be disappointed.



Maybe a bad bottle, but I know for a fact that this was a fresh bottle from a new batch, so I don't know what to make of it. Judge for yourself, but this is my last bottle for a while."

The usual ""coke like"" pour with burgandy highlights at the edges. Very small head and some lacing, but the lacing seemed a little thin. Lack of substantial body also reflected in the mouthfeel.



Obviously OSA like, with darker spices (cinnamon and all spice) very upfront. This years version seems to lack a bit of body for me, although I will definitely have to drink more to get the full effect. A bit more bitterness than I remember in the past and the combination makes it definitely less smooth for me. Slightly bizarre, atificial ""plastic"" taste seemed to linger in the finish too. What's that all about?



All in all, OSA standard, but a little less enjoyable than some other vintages."

Mild Belgian characteristics but this is NOT an authentic Belgian Dark by any stretch of the imagination. Pretty weak and insipid. Somewhat murky brown pour, Dubbel looking. Small head with no retention and no lacing.



Sweet, bubblegum character. Dry finish with very thin mouthfeel. A little fruit - not much.



Not good."

Extremely interesting beer.
Lovely pour with mountains of frothy, deeply pillowed head and a light golden hazed body. Lacing is superb. Nice looker.
OK, here we go with an explanation of this beer. The best I can offer is a ""hoppy, thick Saison"". All the characteristics of Saison Dupont with a much hoppier edge. Mouthfeel is huge for the style and lacks any feeling of a letdown. Beautiful balance as the hops give EXACTLY the correct amount of bitterness to complement the funk notes of the style.
Wave after wave of pleasure. Small bubbles of carbonation stimulate the palate, but their softness is extreme. Velvet like. Gets sweeter and sweeter as the beer drinks.

Great color with crystal clear copper notes and a lot more carbonated than I remember in the past. Lots of rising bubbles. Smallish head and not much lace.



As usual very clean grapefruit notes are all over the place and not much else. I don't mind Celebration, but I simply do not find it to be a very complex beer. It's really just a hop concoction without much character to me."

Annoying carbonation on the opening of the impressive looking bottle. Wave afer wave of light bubbles waste a substantial amount of beer on the kitchen counter. Cloudy apple juice colored liquid (a lot of yeast sediment), not really what I am looking for in my Tripel's.



Decent Belgian yeasty and mildly spiced aroma. A little bit of a honey cheerio grain/cereal smell too.



Tastes are incredibly sweet even for my sugar loving palate. It ends with a huge alcohol finish and a psuedo Belgian spice note and some bitterness. All a bit of a mess.



This is definitely not a very good Tripel, but it seems to have a certain charm. I managed to drink it despite its obvious shortcomings."

12 oz single, Liquor Barn, Lexington, KY, USA.



Very disappointing Winter Warmer, but a nice Brown Ale! Pour is basically solid brown wih some head and a little lacing. Lacks the red highlights that sometimes accompany WW's. Malty sweetness in the aroma. 



Tastes seriously lack the spices I was expecting from the style. What we get instead is a nicely balanced Brown Ale with good tasty malts and a satisfyingly dry finish.



Enjoyable as a beer - it'll disappoint you as a WW I expect."
Avery Brewing Company,Avery Anniversary Ale - Eleven,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,9.00%,bottle,3.95,3,4,4,4,4,11/16/2006,"22 oz bottle, Liquor Barn, Lexington, KY, USA.



Gold foil on the neck with an attractive silver and green label. 



Murky orange pour with a little bit of sediment. Nice frothy substantial head an some sticky lacing. Overall this reminded me of Sam Adams Imperial Pils. Hoppy (peppery) resinous with huge sweet malts backing them up.



Aroma is a lot of fruit pineapple notes.



Dry grapefruit and noticeble alcohol in the finish.



Nowhere near a frea\sh sample, and although that means I'm not drinking it as nature intended I still enjoyed the development of the beer. 



Once again, VERY similar to SA Imp Pils."

Initially a nice head with the aggressive pour, but of course this is quickly lost to absolutely nothing because of the ABV. Good legs come with the alcohol.



Color is a beautiful, roasted tawny, deep color. Massive alcohol sherry notes in the nose - delicious.



Tastes are obviously huge alcoholic caramalized malts and not much else. Having said that it is very drinkable and easy to consume despite the fact that sipping at the end of the evening is the best way to enjoy this baby. Considering the style and the ABV, this is extraordinarily drinkable.



Quite dry in the finish, and it lacks the burning warmth that some of these types can deliver. Drier and less challenging in the alcohol department that some."
"Anheuser-Busch, Inc.",Winter's Bourbon Cask Ale,,,Winter Warmer,6.00%,on-tap,3.95,4,4,4,3.5,4,11/12/2006,"Even better on draft than in the bottle. I like this because of the sweetness and the vanilla character. Many will not like this much, probably for one of several reasons not least of all being the fact it is an AB product. I'm over that, and I must say this drinks pretty easily.



Less spice than your average Winter Warmer, almost like a sweet, vanilla brown ale. That is not going to be to eveyones taste, but it's right up my alley.

Yep, does a super job for an American version of the style. Dark orange pour with a lovely head and some first classs lacing. Some chill haze.



Very fruity nose with equally fruity initial notes in the taste. Mild hops with malt balance, delicious. Not as dry in the finish as many of the style. Mild acidity, but great balance and really tasty and refreshing feeling.



At the right temperature, this is everyday drinking material - very good."

Bluegrass Brewing Company,Bluegrass Nut Brown Ale,,,English Brown Ale,5.00%,on-tap,4.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,11/12/2006,"Good stuff. On-tap at Mellow Mushroom, Lexington, KY - around $2 a pint!



Dark brown pour that suffers from being served too cold, but after the beer wams all the attributes start to be enhanced and come through nicely. The temperature affected the pour making it look rather flat. After warming and with a little agitation we get what the beer should resemble Lovely deep color and excellent head and lacing.



Lovely nutty sweet nose. A little edgier than say, Rogue Hazelnut, but it has any of those great characteristics. Sweet nut nose and initial tastes, loads of sweet malts and a finish that is pleasing both in terms of the taste and bitterness. Very tasty, very moreish.



The nutty brown ales live and die by their mouthfeel and their ability to hold together the whole drink. Watery brown ales are a disaster and you need body - this one does the job well.



Delicious once it warms, a really nice offering."
Boulder Beer / Wilderness Pub,Hazed & Infused,,,American Pale Ale (APA),4.90%,bottle,3.33,4,3.5,3.5,2.5,3,11/12/2006,"Decent beer, but the style is somewhat uninspiring to me. 12 oz bottle purchased as a single from Liquor Barn, Lexington, KY, USA.



Copper colored pour with good head and some lacing. Good balance between a really quite hoppy nose and a more malt based taste. A little too grainy for the style I felt. Not bad all around but the mouthfeel is what lets this down. Rather thin. When that happens it reduces the drinkability and the pleasure.



Maybe this was a beer that was hyped beyond what it could realistically deliver and because of that I was disappointed."

Typically Belgian, but with one or two odd twists. Firstly the body was very clear - almost like a macro lager. It did come with a great, rocky and pillowed frothy head and some chill haze, AND all the other usual Belgian attributes were in place; plenty of fruit character, typical Belgian sugars and yeasts and lots of spice character. Just like BEERchitect suggested, I got some salty tastes as well.
Rather against the grain was a lingering bitterness that didn't seem like a hop based flavor. Much more like some kind of artificial bitterness like Angostura. Nevertheless I still enjoyed it and found it to be very drinkable. If anyhting it seemed to drink a little stronger than the 7.3% ABV advertised."

Well, here we go with another Sam Calagione/DFH inspired ""concept"" (for want of a better term) beer. Frankly I'm not really *that* interested in the thinking behind such beers, only if they taste good now! The history and context is nice, but without a quality, highly drinakble product at the end of the process there is not much in it for consumers at the sharp end. DFH may have learned a lot about brewing via the process, but the drinkeres won't be very concerned with that. Luckily, this one does taste good!



Pours cloudy orange with a nicely formed, thick head that has some very good retention. Lacing is mid-range with a thickness that is a little deceiving. Sweet, honey based, slightly floral (hop) nose, light and rather attractive. Nice thick and satisfying mouthfeel - seems quite luxurious - velvet like.



Tastes are light and sweet. Honey with some very mild acidity. Much like the DFH Pangaea, this feels like a bitter shandy with English lemonade (Sprite/7-Up) added to a low ABV sessionable typical bitter. It's very drinkable but ultimately quite poor value with a price tag of $12+ .



Very smooth and really easy to quaff, this is a very interesting beer, but it's a little pricey for what it is. Worth a one-off purchase definitely, but I don't think I could justify regularly spending the cash for this brew. Since we don't get DFH in GA, that's not really a huge problem!"

Nice light color, but a fast fading head. A small amount of lacing.
To me this drinks more like a hybrid English/American IPA. It lacks the biscuit malt subtlety of a typical English Pale Ale or Bitter, and it fails to deliver that mild fruity aftertaste, but it does compensate for some of those shortfalls with pleasing American IPA bitterness that I was not expecting.
A little more harsh than I would like, with a bit of fruity acidity up front. Once you get used to it it's not unpleasant, just a bit alarming at the beginning. Fruit continues throughout the beer, and in the finish the hops compliment them well. I get pears and pineapple? perhaps.
Not bad, a good everyday beer and decent ""sessionable"" potential, but not your classic English Bitter by any stretch of the imagination."
"Anheuser-Busch, Inc.",Jack's Pumpkin Spice Ale,,,Pumpkin Ale,5.50%,bottle,2.43,2,2.5,2.5,2,2.5,11/11/2006,"$6.99 for a sixer at Hiram Bottle Shop, GA, USA. Bought a sixer of this PURELY on the strength of my enjoyment of the AB Winter Bourbon Cask (which I thought was decent). Should have known better than to trust AB for a second time, and I should definitely have gone with some more WBCA instead!



To be fair this was fairly unoffensive, but that's where the compliments end. Decent orange color with good clarity but the usual lack of life. No head, no lace, looks dead.



Aromas and tastes are mildly spiced wih that typical off-pumpkin smell but with this beer we have eveything muted. The mouthfeel is very poor, it's simply way too thin to hold up to any scrutiny. In the end just a notch or two above macro swill."
Goose Island Beer Co.,India Pale Ale,,,English India Pale Ale (IPA),5.90%,on-tap,4.33,4.5,5,4,4,4.5,11/11/2006,"On draft at Mellow Mushroom in Lexington with BEERchitect. Very good value at about $2.00 a pint!
Fairly standard looking in terms of the color, but the head & lacing was superb. The lacing was both extensive and sticky. Aroma was overwhelmingly that of orange zest. Delicious to look and to smell. I'd surprised if these attributes could be reproduced quite so well in the bottle.
In terms of taste it drank like a quality American micro IPA. Nothing really special, but solid, realiable everyday drinking and at these prices it would be! Mild hop profile (at least for the American version of an IPA) but not remotely astringent. Held together with good malt balance, and you have just about all you can ask for in the genre. Tasty with a good mouthfeel."
"Pyramid Breweries, Inc.",Thunderhead IPA,,,American IPA,6.70%,bottle,3.98,3.5,4,4,4,4,11/11/2006,"$1.20 bought as a single from one of the Liquor Barn locations on my recent trip to Lexington.



Dark orange pour, slightly cloudy, small head and a little bit of sticky lacing. Mild citrus hops in the nose.



Mild grapefruit with a sugary, malt backbone that pulls it all into balance.



I like this beer mainly becasue it is typically ""American IPA"", but it seems to have a West Coast feel that IS in balance. Unusual for some West Coast over hopped IPA's. I suppose that in that respect this will disappoint some, but for me it incorporated all the good things about the American version of the style without the resin based mouth stripping hops that cn sometimes accompany the style.



Good job - not sure that ""Bursting with Hops"" is accurate, but a nice, mild IPA that is drinkable and tasty."
Belhaven Brewery Company Ltd.,Belhaven Twisted Thistle IPA,,,English India Pale Ale (IPA),5.30%,bottle,3.7,2,3.5,4,3,4,11/10/2006,"Liquor Barn purchase, Lexington, KY as a 500 mL bottle.



UnGodly amount of sediment in the pour. Sediment fails to settle well, and as a result this is a pretty unattractive pint. Nice head and some super lacing - this is NOT an easy beer to give an appearance score to!



Aroma is muted sweet malts. A DEFINITE smokiness! Odd.



Tastes are somewhat typically ""British"" IPA with a distinct lack of hops (I've been in the USA too long!) Finishes dry, but that's OK since the malts earlier in the drink support the whole thing nicely. More light smoke.



Don't come here looking for a hop-bomb, you won't find it, but what you do get is a nice biscuit malt British Pale Ale with a bit of a added hop dry finish.



A little over carbonated for my taste. Nice malted aftertaste. A bit of an odd combination, but despite that it drinks and tastes above average."

Thanks go out to nlmartin as part of Secret Santa 2007. Much lighter in color than some of the same style. Still seems slightly alcoholic for the style. Still tastes good, but a little odd.
Originial Review 11/06
===
Purchased as a single on a recent rip to Lexington, KY. 12 oz bottle. GREAT clarity with a copper color and a nicely formed, capped head. No lacing. Some decent legs.
Aroma is the typical spice with sweet alcohol notes. Taste is a tad more alcoholic than many of the style, but it still drinks with plenty of orange flavors. A little more tart (citrus peel) than other Christmas spiced ales.
Definitely of the genre and the style, but it has a characteristic and slightly different flavor. One of my favorite styles, this is a tiny bit too edgy for the style for me since I like more malt content and some bigger body. Having said that a nice beer."
Bluegrass Brewing Company,Homewrecker,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,?,bottle,3.38,3,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,11/9/2006,"Thick gold foil on the neck of the capped 750 mL bottle. Thanks go out to BEERchitect for the gift.



Cloudy, honey colored pour with excessive carbonation. The carbonation is too much for me, too much for the style and frankly a little annoying. Some sticky lacing and some foamy head but it is a little inconsistent. The carbonation imparts a prickly mouthfeel that I don't much care for.



This is a VERY typical over-the-top American Double IPA. Huge, west coast style piney and resinous hops that are frankly a little out of balance. While this is NOT a bad beer, for me it typifies a lot of what is wrong with the American version of this style. Hops way too green and out of whack and it seems big for the sake of being being and lacks balance and subtlety. I did enjoy it a little more with a small knob of strong English cheddar - it seemed to mellow out the mouthfuls.



The kind of beer I CAN drink, but it lacks craft in my opinion. The kind of thing I feel I could knock up in the basement myself."
Thomas Creek Brewery,River Falls Red Ale,,,Irish Red Ale,5.70%,bottle,2.58,3,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,11/9/2006,"Single 12 oz bottle.



Another below average offering from Thomas Creek. I've had a number of their beers now, and I'm about to give up - they're simply not very good.



Mid-amber pour with a short-lived head and very little sustainable lacing. Slightly acrid smell with some apple (ethanal) notes. Possible infection?



Tastes reflect the aroma. Mild apples, slight acid and weak. Weak is a good word for the whole experience.



Very light mouthfeel (a constant problem with Thomas Creek) which really means a very significant lack of body. Thin."
Breckenridge Brewery,471 IPA,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,9.20%,bottle,4.2,5,4,4,4.5,4.5,11/8/2006,"12 oz single, $1.70, Liquor Barn, Lexington, KY, USA.
Very light in color, an orange hue with some lovely, sticky lacing. Looks great in the glass with layered, complex lacing.
The nose and the tastes are really rather sweet which would not be to some peoples liking, but suited me just fine. Hops are there, but so is balance. Alcohol is present in the nose, but I was ASTONISHED (and I mean ASTONISHED!) to see this listed at 9.2%. I quaffed this at an alarming rate and didn't notice a thing. The alcohol is certainly amazingly well hidden.
This was my first experience with this brewery and I was delighted with the quality and the value of this beer. Most impressed and really nice DIPA."

Several years ago this was one of my favorite beers - I used to drink it a lot on regular trips to Northern France and Belgium. Since leaving England and coming to the USA, I have not had an opportunity to get hold of any, and as a result I have been craving it for a long time. I was worried that nostalgia was getting the better of me, and that I would be terribly disappointed, but it held up extremely well.
Very, very nice in all respects. Sweet yeasty malts, velvet smooth in the mouth and quaffable by the bucket load. Probably too sweet for many, to me this is a typically rich, alcoholic and smooth Belgian - a treat that with a sensible ABV I can enjoy lots of.
Malt and complex, this is a beer that has a lot of detractors but although somewhat unfashionable, I think does really well."
Bluegrass Brewing Company,Altbier,,,Altbier,?,bottle,3.65,3.5,4,3.5,3,4,11/5/2006,"Thanks to BEERchitect for this offering.



Mid amber pour with some lacing and a small head. Nice legs on the beer considering the relatively (I assume) low alcohol. Smell is really fruity. Surprising! I get mainly pears.



A little dry for me in the mouth, but not to any alarming extent. The tastes are typically Altbier. Brown ale malts but more reserved than an English (or indeed) an American version. Fruit comes through a little in the taste, but not to any extent. Tiny hop finish. Tasty."

Pour is jet balck with some ruby red highlights at the extreme edges. Not much head and some lacing. Strong port and alcohol aroma.



Mouthfeel is huge with layers and layers of thick sweetness.



This drinks as if it were a RIS. Burned malts, strong alcohol, bitter-sweet and large, this is a porter that is busting out of its pants in an attempt to be an imperial/double stout.



Drinkability is limited becasue of the combo of alcohol, sweetness, syrupy mouthfeel and general ""largeness"".



A little too strong and aggressive in the style for my liking, but obviously an exceptional brew."

""Born on"" Oct 13 2006. Blue and White main and neck labels, ""Limited Edition, Seasonal Brew"", featuring the Snowman character lifting a glass of the beer.



Nice looking copper colored clarity, with an initial decent head, but this fades fast. No lacing, but some spotty head left behind. The aroma is an odd combination of indistinguishable spices and some cooked vegetables.



Tastes are slight vanilla with a dryish hop finish. Fairly dry in the mouth. Lacks smoothness, malt backbone for my liking and the style, but not bad. Glad I didn't get a sixer, but worth a try. I think I might try it on draft the next time I see it."

2004 Vintage.



It's an extraordinary beer, in fact in many ways it's barely a beer, but it is just about what I expected.



Pour is a deep orange viscous liquid with a head that disappears immediately. Amazingly sweet nose and tastes but the finish tempered by a really nice, warming smooth port finish. At 11.50 % this is close to unbelievable. The alcohol is there and is warming, but hardly noticeable. I could drink a huge amount of this - I'd probably regret it, but the drinkability is off the charts. Obviously amazingly rich.



A great example of the difference between American And English Barley Wines - all sweetness here with virtually no hop bitterness."
Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company,Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat,,,Witbier,4.90%,bottle,3.35,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,10/28/2006,"From a brewery that I have been underwhelmed with in the past, and a style that is certainly not my favorite, and drinking it at the wrong time of year when it was probably older than was good for it...I wasn't really expecting this to be a very good experience, but actually not bad. Just goes to show that you never know.



Cloudy, butterscotch pour with a decent head, but shortlived. Some lacing. An odd aroma of licorice at first followed by a more familar corriander, lemon and orange. Mouthfeel is a little prickly and too carbonated for my liking.



Quite tasty with the orange and lemon notes dominating, but again some kind of add licorice taste mixed in there too. Typical Wheat aftertaste with accentuated citrus. Would probaly add a half point to this if drinking it fresh in the early summer."
Bison Brewing Co.,Bison Organic Belgian Ale,,,Tripel,8.10%,bottle,3.08,3.5,3,3,2.5,3.5,10/27/2006,"22 oz bomber.



Pale golden pour into the Duvel glass. Clear, golden pour with a somewhat thin and disappointing head. Watery lacing - not much of it.



Very mild yeast and spice in the nose. Tastes are extremely mild too. This drinks like a Tripel lite, which of course defeats the whole purpose of a really alcoholic, heay, sweet tripel. Having said that, the more to the bottle that I drink, the more it grows on me. Definitely ""different"" tastes which I suppose is the Organic nature of the product.



Extremely mild pepper in the finish, nowhere near the big pepper bite that you would expect for the style."

If you are wondering what a Seaweed flavored Ale drinks like, the answer is that (this one at least) drinks like a light bodied, brown ale without the malt.



Pours Porter black/brown with a nice head and some decent lacing. A good fruity, alcohol type aroma that is frankly better than the taste. The body (or lack of it) lets this beer down. Thin and a little unsatisfying. A wee bit dry and earthy too.



Finish is an unusual combination of organic soil (maybe that is the seaweed?) and slight stout like bitterness.



All in all I'm glad I tried it, and it is a bit of a weird combo, but this is strictly a one off for me."

2005 Vintage.
Pour is close to black with some dark brown/red highlights at the extremeties. Not much sustainable head, and not much lacing. Some creamy spottiness on the surface. A little more carbonated than I was expecting. In fact, quite fizzy hen you listen carefully - takes a little away from the mouthfeel for me.
Aroma is amazing. Sweet, sweet smoke that is obvious but beautifully understated. NOT like many Rauchbiers that I have had. This is definitely an example of a smoked sausage or smoked ham type beer, but the sweetness gets bigger and bigger as you drink. Wave after wave of mild smoked cheeses, meats and fish - I'm not a huge fan of smoked foods, but this is exceptional.
I am amazed at the drinkability and the smell of this beer, both are exceptional. Sweet smoke. If you don't like smoked beers much, try this. It just may change your mind."
Williams Brothers Brewing Company,Grozet Gooseberry & Wheat Ale,,,Scottish Gruit / Ancient Herbed Ale,5.00%,bottle,4.05,3,4,4,4,4.5,10/18/2006,"Cloudy orange pour. Hazy and cloudy, like a poor quality iced-tea. No head and very little lace.



Very sharp, lemony and refreshing all around. Reminiscent of some other beers from this brewery. The Heather ale and this one drink like bitter shandy - that classic mix of English Bitter and English Lemonade (7-Up/Sprite) to produce an easy drinking and very fresh and light tastes.



Good beer - different - and worth a try."

Chill-hazed, bright orange pour with what seems to be an unfiltered look about this beer. Head goes quickly but there is some sticky lacing.
Mild spice in the aromas and fairly mild in the taste too. The finish is really very citrus peel bitter - almost soap like. I was a little taken aback by the sharp bitterness in the end. Lingers a little. Not unpleasant, just more than I was expecting.
Nice mouthfeel and drinkable and refreshing. A little less tasty in the spice department than say, a DFH version of the style, but nonetheless a decent beer."

Huge billowing, fluffy head with tons of lace. Great pour. A little drab on the color side of things, a dark brown with a little haze and cloudiness.
Colossal aromas fill the nose in the Duvel tulip. Yeast fruits dominate.
Big estery mouthfeel and huge Belgian yeast presence. A little hoppier than the regular Abt 12 and in that respect it reminds me a little of Houblon Chouffe. Complex sugars at first that fade to really quite a bitter finish. Despite that pretty smooth.
Drinkability is obviously high and a wonderful addition to the St. Bernardus range."
Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,Punkin Ale,,,Pumpkin Ale,7.00%,bottle,4.58,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,10/15/2006,"Thanks go out to SilentSabre for generously thinking of me on one of his recent trades - I am absolutely delighted he did.
Label has this described as a brown ale which is immediately contradicted by the ""English Pale Ale orange colored"" beer that flows from the bottle. Nice tight head forms with some lacing.
Aromas and tastes are one and same with a wonderful combination of all-spice, nutmeg, a little pumpkin and plenty of brown sugar - one of the few times that a label very accurately describes what comes out of the bottle!
Smooth, tasty, and massively drinkable this avoids all the pitfalls of many pumpkin ales with body, satisfaction, taste and drinkability far surpassing most other examples of the style.
It just so happens that, after a few years of thinking DFH was one of the best breweries in the USA, I had been a little disapointed by some of my recent experiences - this beer restores the faith! A great offering."

Pour is good looking with a small but dense head on top of a dark orange cloudy body. Aromas all all scrumpy cider and that's the taste too. My guess is that this is infected, but there is no date on the bottle so it's difficult to tell how long this has been hanging around.



I am assuming that this Hefe is not supposed to taste like that but I'm not sure."

Pour was much lighter than expected but still produced a decent head and some nice lacing.



Quite metallic and bitter, with a lack of the sweetness that I was expecting. I suppose because of the Oktoberfest name I was expecting some more malts and a little more sweetness. I see that this is listed as an Amber/Red and that would explain a lot. Mild hops and some light warmth.



Nice, session potential and a good, solid offering. The few beers I have had from Otter Creek I have enjoyed very much."
Wychwood Brewery Company Ltd,WychCraft,,,English Pale Ale,4.50%,bottle,4.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,10/14/2006,"New to GA, USA this week. Classy looking brown bottle, 500 mL Beverage Resort, Kennesaw, GA, USA, $3.99.



Very pale orange pour with some decent carbonation, a small but really fluffy head and some good lacing. Looks nice. Lovely combination of hops upfront, balanced malt backbone and some classic English PA biscuit tones in the background. Full and creamy mouthfeel.



Pretty dry finish but the combination still manages to give that classic buttery, baked flavor.



I know that Wychwood gets some bad press in the USA but I suggest trying this because I think it has the potential to make Americans feel better about the brewery. Nothing that we get bottled stateside will ever been the same as sucking back a few in Oxford, but this is a decent substitute and I think it should be received well here."

2008 vintage from a 12oz bottle.
Thought that it was time to re-review a fresh vintage so here we go with the 2008 version.
The usual dark, dark brown almost black pour with the promise of a creamy experience in the head and lace. Large, creamy and coffee-milky bubbles form at the edge of the head. Some lace.
Nose and tastes this year seems a little less spicy to me, but there is a VERY distinct harsher, solvent alcohol edge to this beer. 
Some acidic, orangey licorice notes.
Quite sultry and dark; definitely less highly spiced on my palate in 2008.
Worth looking at my other reviews of earlier vintages for some more perspective.
2006 Vintage

1.5L wax covered swingtop #5249.
The new 2006 vintage out of the bottle is drinking like a brown ale (just like the 2006 draught version - see my review of that).
A little thinner in the bottle (perhaps just my imagination) and it seems to have a touch more alcohol content in the bottle."

Again less spice than some of the first vintages and this year more licorice flavors. Still drinking well though. === 2006 Vintage - on tap. Taco Mac Linbergh City Center, $4.50. Still the same attractive pour and nice head and lacing - in fact perhaps even better than in the recent past. This year the vintage is drinking very nicely but VERY differently.  MUCH less spice, and flows like a malty brown ale. Color is pretty much the same as it has been in the past, what is different is the aroma and the lack of spice bite. Significantly smoother than it has been in the past. Plenty of malts and very smooth. I have a feeling that some may be disappointed by this, but the funny thing is, is that although this seems to go from Winter Warmer to Brown Ale, it's still a lovely beer if somewhat confused over its identity from one year to the next!"

12 oz bottle poured into a regular 16 oz glass. Pale, golden orange with not much head but some nice sticky lacing. A little chill-haze.



Clean and sharp in the taste with some lemony hops. Balanced with really nice sweetness. Mild grapefruit twang in the finish. A little more ""west coast"" than I was expecting.



A very simple, balanced APA. Not usually a favorite style of mine since I think this can be really bland, but this was above average."
Greene King / Morland Brewery,Old Speckled Hen,,,English Pale Ale,5.20%,bottle,4.28,4.5,5,4,4.5,4,10/9/2006,"I first drank this way back in 1990/91 in various pubs around High Wycombe (Mac, Ian, Lea, Jim, Auks I hope you are all well, I miss you all very much). Amazing that I am reviewing this now after all these years so far away from the source. Odd how things sometimes work out.



500 mL bottle (clear bottle haters get your panties out of a wad), approx. $4.00 Taco Mac, East West Connector, Austell, GA, USA.



Lovely burned orange color with a super head (small) with wave after wave of clinging lace. Typical light biscuit, sweet malts are present in the nose and the initial tastes - so far so good -but then I get a rather soapy bitterness that I don't remember from the draught versions years ago. A ""drier than I remember"" yeasty finish too.



This is a little bit unusual amongst the bottled English PA's that make it to the US. There is a much more pronounced dry bitterness about this. Not that those characteristics are unusual in an English bitter in general, but it is a bit odd in one of these imported PA's.



Ultimately still good, but not the truly exceptional beer that this when you drink it in the pubs of High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire or similar English locations."

Big caramel malts in the nose but there is a lack of sweetness in the aroma that one usually finds. The tastes reflect that in as much as the caramel notes are there, but it is a bit drier and more bitter than some of the style. Not fully malted up.



A little thin in the mouth and lacks the sugar overtones that often accompany these malty beers. A nice beer that is certainly drinkable, but for me it's a litle light for the style."

On-tap in October 2006 as part of Sweetwater's re-introduction of Exodus as an ocassional guest (not a seasonal, but an infrequent re-visit) - maybe ESB will do the same soon.



A bit flat. Lack of life makes this look like a coke. This beer is much better than this sample suggests (see my bottle review) and this is a bit of a worry if they are going to re-release this from time to time at this lower quality. A little more bitter than usual too. If possible, it looks a little less black than the bottled version - more brown?

Nice dark orange color with some impressive sticky lacing. Very unusual nose - a real floral, fruity mix with a combination of watermelon and marmalade. Unique and very attractive.



Tastes are balanced with some hop bitterness and sweet malts in equal measure. I get some orange based, grapefruit tartness that is very attractive too. Quite light and floral and zesty. Hoppy to the extent that this doesn't really drink much like an Amber, it'smore like an American IPA.



Unusual combination of tastes and textures that works well for me. Very drinkable and a unique beer."

Into the Duvel tulip this has a huge head that settles down a little in time. Some lace. Body is darker than many Tripel's and has a rich dark gold feel about it. Lots of sweet alcoholic yeast in the nose.



A tart bitterness holds this up nicely and the sweetness that is typical of the style is unusually well balanced. The alcoholic yeast makes the beer finish quite dry. Very mild pepper notes. Quite creamy in the mouth and full



Unusually balanced for the style, the sweetness is muted and in no way overwhelms the beer. Nice example, slightly unusual, but good."

Good ""pop"" on opening the can and a really nice pour with a great head, plenty of lacing and some pronounced chill haze. Clean and tight aroma with some fruit (bananas?) and some yeasty alcohol. ""Wheatiness"" too.



Drinkable and refreshing, re-established my faith in the style - thanks Travis."

Poured into the Southampton Weizen glass, this is picture-book perfect. The head is that oft searched for but seldom found, deep, dense three inches of smoothed out ice-cream dolloped, thick clotted cream foam - perfect. This sits on top of the butterscotch body.



Aroma is typical Hefe, but somewhat muted - not strong. The tastes kind of reflect that too. Banana and clove in there as expected, but we do not get the strong presence of either that the appearance would suggest. Slightly dry, alcoholic finish. Smooth.



Perfect looking beer, but then it fades to just above average. Some prickly carbonation in the mouth that is a little annoying.



I enjoyed it, and it's not a bad example, but it failed to live up to the appearance that was stunning. Maybe it was a victim of its good looks!"

Aroma and tastes are one and the same. Layers and layers of West Coast resinous, pine hops, loads of Christmas based orange citrus fruits (satsumas and tangerines) and lots of alcohol sweetness.



I was very suprised at the level of sweetness in this beer. Coupled with the rather significant orange and alcohol content this drank a bit like a beery Cointreau - seriously! Despite the potentially unappetizing sound of that combo, the drinkability is off the charts (a 5+). Oily mouthfeel without going too far and a satisfying bite.



Alcohol is quite pronounced - be careful.



All in all a very significant and stand-out beer. You've really got to try this, and Stone proves again that they can produce some astonishing beers."
Capital Brewery,Autumnal Fire,,,Doppelbock,7.80%,bottle,4.08,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,10/3/2006,"From BigLove as part of BMB 48 BIF.



Mid-copper pour with a lighter color than I would expect for a DB. Prettylow carbonation. Samll head and only a tiny amount of lace and film on the surface.



Nice, sweet alcohol malt nose that carries through to the taste. A bit of a peppery alcohol burn in the finish.



A little too bitter in the finish for me for the DB style, but nevertheless a nice beer. Enjoyable."
Lagunitas Brewing Company,Lagunitas #10 (aka #9),,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,6.60%,bottle,4.05,5,4,4,4,4,10/1/2006,"Lagunitas just made it to GA a few weeks ago, but this was NOT one that made it from California just yet. Received as part of Blue Max BIF (48) from BigLove. 22 oz bomber.



In terms of the style this is not a typical Saison and it is appropriate that it was poured into the Duvel tulip because this is somewhat reminiscent of that great beer, and it drinks much more like a spicy Belgian Pale or Wit than a Saison.



Fantastic clarity and color. A deep golden body (really beautiful), a big head, some lacing and some nice spotty cream left on the surface. Good carbonation. A slight viscosity associated with the pour too.



Smooth, easy drinking with some yeasty bitterness. The yeast taste is pronounced despite this being a filtered offering. The alcohol content seems well above 6.6% ABV (on label) and feels much more like 7.70 ABV (on the BA database).



Creamy finish with spice notes. Good drinkability.



An interesting beer that seems to cross several boundaries, but anyway you look at it, it's a nice brew. Good late summer/fall drink."
Tröegs Brewing Company,Tröegs Oatmeal Stout,,,Oatmeal Stout,7.00%,bottle,3.95,3,4.5,4,4,3.5,9/30/2006,"Thanks to BeerBeing and SilentSabre.



Good bitterness. Lots of oat character. Dark brown pour with a nice head and some good lacing. Real earthy character that revealed oatmeal charateristics. Significant cereal character in the nose, really nice.



Not much sweetness nor is there much smoothness - this is a stout with some rough edges - as it should be."
The Duck-Rabbit Craft Brewery,Duck-Rabbit Porter,,,American Porter,5.70%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,9/29/2006,"Classic Porter color with it varying between black and dark brown depending on the light. All the different lighting conditions have some red highlights at the extreme edges. Short lived head but there is some lacing and a little spotty film left on the surface.



Good chocolate aromas with the standard lightly roasted malt and nice sweetness.



Mouthfeel has the good creamy nature that I demand from my porters but is often lacking in many examples of the style.



Nice, light cocoa powder tastes, with a little dry finish.



Very good example - if you want to know what a decent Porter is, you could do much worse than this."
Coors Brewing Company,Blue Moon Harvest Moon Pumpkin Ale,,,Pumpkin Ale,5.70%,bottle,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,9/28/2006,"Nice color in the body, a kind of burnt orange with great clarity. Initially a decent head but fades very quickly to nothing. A little Pumpkin flavor in the aftertaste (a vegetable twang) but not much up front. The aroma has something in it too that I simply cannot place - maybe it's even some pumpkin!! Drinks well with a clean taste about it and a mildly bitter finish.



Decent value at around $6 for a sixer, and I might just buy one sixer each year to have on hand for curious guests. I suppose it has some Autumn crossover potential.



Frankly this is a bit like Blue Moon itself, a half decent stand-by if you're in a situation where you can't get REAL craft beer."
Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),Brewer Patriot Collection - George Washington Porter,,,American Porter,?,bottle,3.3,4.5,4.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,9/27/2006,"Well, interesting if nothing else. Pour is good looking. Nice Porter color, dark red/brown and a really rather impressive head (if somewhat airy) and lacing - looks good.



Smell is really nice too. Creamy alcohol sweetness and some dark treacle.



As far as the taste goes I was impressed with the way it literally mimicked what it claimed on the label - DEFINITE ""licorice"" notes, ""assertive hop finish"" and ""medium bodied"" so at least it has that going for it. However, for me the licorice was a little too much, so the Porter became more like a dry stout without the creaminess of a Porter. I suppose that Jim Koch is saying that this is what a Porter once was, but for me it's disappointing in the context of what I want from a Porter now. Even putting that stylistic issue aside for a moment, I simply didn't care much for the taste, it's quite odd, a little bit ""plastic"". Glad I tried it though."
Weyerbacher Brewing Co.,Heresy,,,Russian Imperial Stout,8.00%,bottle,4.53,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,9/25/2006,"Thanks go out to BeerBeing and SilentSabre for this. 12oz bottle poured into the Koningshoeven small chalice.



Pour is black with a nice brown head. Little lacing. Film on the surface of the body.



Some serious chocolate alcohol aromas - fantastic and it promises much. Mouthfeel is light without sacrificing too much. A nice drinkable combo of real taste and depth without turning into an effort to drink it. In fact high drinkabilty for the style.



A little too much carbonation for the style, but a very nice milk chocolate alcohol mix. Ate a chocolate brownie with this for a wonderful combo. Delicious."

The Helles moniker is more evident in this beer than almost any other I have seen. The lightness and the clarity of the body are extraordinary. Extremely pale golden color like Bud Light!!



Aroma is that familiar mild skunk lager smell.



Pours into the Southampton Weizen glass with an enormous rocky head. The head fades slowly to leave some spotty presence and some (not a lot) lacing.



Very crisp clean malts, and a tiny hop presence. A little spicy pepperness but it's muted. Mouthfeel has some creaminess, and the aftertaste is extremely clen - almost water like.



This is a beer that is not especially characterful, but surprisingly I would put this into the crossover category. It really drinks like a macro with class! Clean, refreshing and like a grown-up Bud!"
Greene King / Morland Brewery,Olde Suffolk English (Strong Suffolk Vintage) Ale,,,Old Ale,6.00%,bottle,4.53,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,9/24/2006,"$4.95 Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA. Pretty dark pour with real ruby highlights. Dark wood seems to be present in terms of color, aroma and taste. Nice tan head but not much lacing, however there remains a spotty presence on the surface of the body. Nose is all malts with some port like alcohol fruit sweetness - very, very nice.



Taste is a little more bitter than I was expecting. Some metallic hops against the expected rich malt backbone. A very interesting beer indeed. The oak is present and obvious as is something a bit more complex which I guess is the combination of the blended old and new ales. Gives a multi-faceted feel. It drinks MUCH bigger than the 6.00 % ABV advertised.



This is a multi-layered and complex beer that if it is available cask conditioned I'd imagine it would be spectacular. In the bottle it is just very, very good."
Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel,,,Dunkelweizen,5.30%,bottle,4.38,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,9/23/2006,"$2.49, Green's on Ponce de Leon, Atlanta, GA, USA.



Poured into the Southampton Weizen glass, this has a head that looks superb. Initially huge, it dies slowly to give a rocky and pitted perfect froth. Surprisingly little lacing. Typical cloudy orange body underneath.



Aroma has some bananas, but there seems to be a spiced overtone to it as well - maybe some apples? As it warms the bananas become increasingly apparent.



The tastes are mainly muted bananas. What I like about this beer is it is quintessential for the style. Ask me what a Dunkel should be - this is it. Maybe I should have scored it 5 across the board, but my ratings are not only style based.



Nice round mouthfeel - satisfying and refreshing and light. Surprisingly light actually. Delicious.



Drinakability is excellent, a lovely example and a quality beer."
Broughton Ales Ltd,Old Jock Ale,,,Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy,6.70%,bottle,4.43,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,9/23/2006,"Deep brown color with some head but this fades very quickly. A film forms on the surface. No lacing.



Wonderful rich malts in the nose. The tastes have some great caramel sweetness with a hint of smoke and then a very nice tart cranberry fruit flavor that replaces any bitterness. The sweetness is controlled by the fruit taste. I'd even go as far as to say that it almost drinks like a fruit beer.



Deep and rich flavors with complex fruity sweetness - delicious."
Great Divide Brewing Company,Hercules Double IPA,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,10.00%,on-tap,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,9/23/2006,"On tap, Taco Mac, Decatur, GA, USA. $6.25.



All I have come to expect from this fine beer, at last on tap! This has been constantly out of stock at the Taco Mac East West Connector and I was delighted to be able to snag a pint here instead.



Fine looking brown pour with great lacing. It's all hops - aroma, taste, aftertaste and burps. A classic that is balanced wih some mild sweetness and malt. It teeters on the edge of going too far, but it just about manages to pull it off. It's close, but it works.



A little pricey I gues, but it was nice to try it on tap for the first time. Hop lovers come quickly!"
Jolly Pumpkin Artisan Ales,Calabaza Blanca,,,Witbier,4.80%,bottle,3.28,4.5,2.5,3,4,4,9/23/2006,"$2.49, Green's on Ponce, Atlanta, GA, USA. 12oz bottle.



Annoying huge head that eventually falls back to something managable and sensible. Some lacing. Great color - a hazed, clouded bright yellow, like a top quality Hefe or better. Nice looking pour.



Aroma and tstes give the JP signature acid/funk. OK, now I am beginning to lose some patience with the brewery. This is nothing like a contemporary Wit, and to describe it as such is plain misleading. I like the taste of the beer with that typical West Country (England) farmhouse cider twang, but this is totally out of the modern Belgian Wit style. Perhaps it IS true to some traditional Wit, but for now this is not what I want to purchase when the label says Wit, hence, although I like it, I still took significant points off.



JP appears to be an off the wall brewery to say the least. Right now I have no handle, I guess I have to keep trying!"
Left Hand Brewing Company,Sawtooth Ale,,,Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB),5.30%,on-tap,3.35,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,9/23/2006,"On tap Taco Mac, Decatur, GA, USA. $5.00.



Light, APA mid orange color with a lot of chill haze. Extremely mild citrus hop flavor with some orange or lemon notes. Served way too cold and as a result the aroma is difficult to pick up, but whatever it is it is muted.



Somewhat thin in the mouth, fairly non-descript all around. Some lacing (above average) with an odd sweetness to the beer. In my experience a typical Left Hand product - OK, but rather run-of-the-mill."
Murphy Brewery Ireland Limited,Murphy's Irish Stout,,,Irish Dry Stout,4.00%,nitro-can,2.95,4,2,3,3,3.5,9/22/2006,"$3.75 for the ""draft style"" can at Taco Mac, Douglasville, GA, USA. Brewed in England under license from Murphy's. Imported to the USA.



Good clean looking appearance with a nice ""lace"" aka ""a nitro foam head that sticks to the glass"" with jet black body. Head is thin. Smell is non-descript to me with a feint, sweet alcohol aroma.



Taste is dry and smooth with very, very little taste. Thin mouthfeel and very easy to drink, but this is an extremely ordinary offering in the can. Much better on draft."
Flying Dog Brewery,In-Heat Wheat,,,Hefeweizen,4.70%,bottle,3.65,2.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,9/21/2006,"Above average drinkabilty in this ""Hefe"" (self proclaimed). Head was disappointing but good color with what appears to be a butterscotch chill haze. Good banana/clove sweetness and a very refreshing taste. Kind of beer that hits the spot in the right circumstances, that is when a thirst quencher is required."
Gordon Biersch Brewery Restaurant,Gordon Biersch Blonde Bock,,,Bock,7.00%,on-tap,4.13,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,9/19/2006,"Very nice brew.



Excellent color - real vibrant yellow, with a super, fluffy, rocky head that looks very inviting. A nice combination of mild hop bitterness and sweet backbone hold the beer together.



An unusual combination of satisying mouthfeel and substance, along with a very drinkable and refreshing beer.



I found it very easy to consume a lot of this, but be careful, the 7.0% ABV will catch up with you quickly. Nice."
De Leyerth Brouwerijen (Urthel),Urthel Samaranth,,,Quadrupel (Quad),11.00%,bottle,4.08,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,9/17/2006,"Very nice looking with a lovely clear copper colored body, plenty of lacing and a permanent spotty head across the surface.
Heady, warming alcohol ester sweetness in the nose, all of which is reflected in the taste, but without either the harsh sweetness or alcohol that one might expect.
Mouthfeel is light considering the style. Lack of syrup adds to the drinkability, but this still drinks close to the 12%.
It's a big beer, but has a smoother edge than some of both the alcohol content and the style. Certainly mega-sweet, but pretty much as I was expecting. You'll need to like the style to enjoy this, otherwise it may be a bit of an effort."
North Coast Brewing Co.,Old Plowshare Stout,,,American Stout,5.70%,bottle,4.2,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,9/17/2006,"A Whole Foods purchase as part of a four pack.



Good head on the pour that tends to fade, but still leaves some lacing and a little spotty, creamy film on the surface of the beer. Color is a dark brown. Nose is a good, deep chocolate cocoa with some espresso notes.



Tastes are mild, milk chocolate and a tiny bitter coffee. Very nice. Dry is the keynote here, and a very, very nice mild creamy chocolate aftertaste. Quite impressed."
Jolly Pumpkin Artisan Ales,"Luciérnaga, The Firefly",,,Belgian Pale Ale,6.50%,bottle,2.9,4.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,9/16/2006,"$9.99 Green's Buford Highway, Atlanta, GA, USA. 750 mL bottle.



Mid-orange body with thick, milkshake like head poured into the Duvel tulip. Some nice lacing. Looks very nice.



Belgian spiced overtones and a hint of acidity and farmyard funk (apples and West Country Cider) in the nose. 



I dunno, this is the second Jolly Pumpkin offering that I have had, and the experience has been almost identical in each case. There is an inordinate amount of funk and acidity that would be OK in a cross between a Flanders Red and a Saison/Wild, but seems horribly out of place in a beer that is categorized as a Belgian Pale. I think if you are drinking this and expecting a typical sweet, candied mildly spiced Belgian, you are going to be very disappointed. If you are a fan of sour beers you'll probably enjoy this - I'm not, so I was slightly let down. I found pretty much he same thing with La Roja; http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/9897/19314/?ba=Ding.



I guess my gripe is a style thing, but it appears that the Jolly Pumpkin beers are going to be strongly featuring the Saison/farmhouse funk angle regardless of the style that they are trying to achieve."

Appearance is EXACTLY like a Coke. Same black body with some brown highlights. ZERO head or lacing and a little bit of constant carbonation. Nose has a little licorice and smoke, a small amount of alcohol and chocolate. Very thin mouthfeel with a little prickly carbonation. Almost no tangible body.



Slightly bitter with a dry cocoa taste. A little powdery. Weak and insipid. Disappointing all around."
Traquair House Brewery Lld,Traquair Jacobite,,,Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy,8.00%,bottle,4.13,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,9/16/2006,"330 mL bottle.



Basically exactly what I expected. Deep brown color, all malt and a tinge of alcohol on top. The head is great initially but this fades to almost nothing and very little lacing. The only disappointment is the mouthfeel which is a bit thin.



Plenty of alcohol soaked figs in the nose - some Christmas tastes.



Tastes are typical for the style with malt and mild alcohol layers cascading over one another - delicious.



Drinkabilty is high."
Lagunitas Brewing Company,Lagunitas Imperial Stout,,,Russian Imperial Stout,8.20%,bottle,3.83,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,9/15/2006,"22 oz Bomber with the distinctive Lagunitas label.



Dark brown rather than black pour and plenty of red highlights. Small head with not much lacing. A lot of sweetness in the nose.



OK, on to the crucial stuff. This beer is going to sit badly with some people because of the style that this is being categorized as. If you open this, drink it and score it as a RIS, you are going to be disappointed and critical. However, if you take it for what it is (rather than the somewhat arbitrary category that it is placed into) then you will probably enjoy it.



Mouthfeel is very light, but not thin, and this feature enhances the drinkability. Alcohol is very well hidden and the tastes are very chocolate based. Nice, tasty and drinkable. Low hop profile, a lack of bitterness which was a nice change. Almost light enough to be considered a Porter rather than a Stout, which is very odd for a beer that is categorized as a RI stout.



Let's be clear - if you are wanting a heavy, deep, big, big kicking RIS this is NOT it. BUT, if you want a tasty, drinkable, lighter balanced stout then you'll enjoy this, I did."
Founders Brewing Company,Founders Dirty Bastard,,,Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy,8.50%,bottle,3.55,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,9/14/2006,"Very strange. Has all the characteristics of a very nice malty Scotch Ale but it rapidly goes off in a very odd direction. Its problems all stem from the over developed hops.



Dark garnet color with not much head. Good deep color, no lacing. Lovely malty nose with some sweet alcohol and this is reflected in the taste. Warming on the way down and all is well with the malty style until the last throws of the taste. Then we get a bitter hop finish. The bitterness is not very sharp or pronounced, but it IS out of context for the style. I just don't get it. 



Oh well, it's still a very drinkable beerand I enjoyed it but just a little odd in terms of style."
Brouwerij De Dolle Brouwers,De Dolle Arabier,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,7.00%,bottle,3.53,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,9/13/2006,"Poured into the Duvel tulip there is an enormous billowing head. Honey butterscotch colored cloudy body with persistent carbonation. Nice lacing.



Lots of organic hay and grass in the nose - very musty. Tastes are very peppery. This is another Belgian that is hoppier than usual and has a really very, very distinct bitter finish. Not at all usual and a little unsettling. The bitterness is almost soapy - not a good thing!



I dunno, the whole sweet, Belgian Pale with added hop profile really doesn't sit all that well with me. The whole beer seems to fall between styles and doesn't work really well. Hoppy (bitter) Belgians just (generally) don't do it for me."
Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,60 Minute IPA,,,American IPA,6.00%,bottle,4.28,3,4,4.5,4,4.5,9/12/2006,"I've had 60 minute on tap before, but this was my first venture with the bottle - thanks to Silentsabre (and his mom!) for the opportunity.



The first feature is the glaring clear golden yellow pour - pretty much as you would expect any old macro lager to look like. Head is small and gone quickly, and there isn't much lacing to speak of. Frankly this looks mighty average.



The taste of course is quite a different matter. Subtle simplicity sum this up. Hops and malt in near perfect balance provide a sweeter beer than one might expect with a pleasing bitter finish and aftertaste. A real (if small) metallic twang in the ending.



Highly drinkable, with excellent session potential. A great candidate to have in the fridge on a daily basis, and plenty of crossover potential too."
Fuller Smith & Turner PLC,Fuller's London Pride,,,English Pale Ale,4.70%,on-tap,3.68,3,4,3.5,3.5,4,9/9/2006,"On tap, Taco Mac, East West connector, Atlanta, GA, USA.



Mmm, bizarre that after drinking a gazillion pints of this in the past I have never formally reviewed this. Also bizarre that the first time I am reviewing it I am drinking it in the USA! Funny how things work out sometimes. Anyway……



Served too cold (as usual I had to intercept the frosted glass that this was about to be poured into! Can you believe it?) and with a criminal neglect of creating a decent head this makes a mockery of what this beer can (and should) look like. Allowing it to come up to the correct temperature solves half of that problem.



Outside of the appearance and lack of general care, this beer still manages to impart at least some of the characteristics I would expect to find closer to the source. A pronounced dry biscuit maltiness and a stronger than expected hop finish. Caramel overtones too – a classic, lower ABV sessionable English Bitter.



This review in NO way reflects my real love of this beer in its “real” format in England, but it does give a small reminder of how great beer in general (and this beer in particular) can be. A pint in Chiswick would probably be close to all fives, but for now this will have to do."
Jolly Pumpkin Artisan Ales,La Roja,,,American Wild Ale,7.20%,bottle,3.6,4.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,9/9/2006,"Well, interesting to say the least, but in the end it was disappointing. A difficult beer to review on lots on levels, but I'll have a go!



Nice bottle presentation in the 750 mL size, $7.99 in lots of Atlanta outlets. This has been in GA for a few months.



On opening, a large amount of carbonation serves to spill quite a substantial amount of the contents over the counter - a little annoying but I can get over it. In the Duvel tulip this has great presence in terms of the head and lacing (EXCELLENT), but the body has a ruddy red, dirty appearance that is less attractive. This color is a pet peeve of mine (a nasty, murky color with some floaties) and without it this would otherwise be a 5 on the appearance score.



Taste and aroma are one and the same. Funky, earthy acidic farmhouse notes. Basically this is a refined Flanders Red with acidity lower than you would find in something like a Rodenbach, but still maintaining the classic English, West Country rural cider notes. Definitely has a countryside feel with plenty of ""horse-blanket"" and Saison funk - which is very acceptable for the style - but at the same time gives a greater acidity than I would expect.



I'm confused over the style. Biere de Garde to me means 3 Monts and Jenlain. This is ""Rodenbach Lite"", a Flanders Red that is less assertive and aggressive with out the drinkability and sweetness I have previously associated with the style. I guess my education continues!



Try it and see what you think."
Founders Brewing Company,Founders Bad Habit Belgian Quad,,,Quadrupel (Quad),9.80%,bottle,3.6,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,9/7/2006,"Can you say bubblegum??



Clear, copper colored pour with no head or lace (consistent with ABV%) when poured into the Koningshoeven small goblet. 



Alcoholic bananas and cloves in the nose which is quite strong. Sweet tastes with an alcoholic warming in the finish, but bubblegum is the overwhelming feeling that this leaves behind. Drinks all of its 9.8% ABV, if not a little stronger. Strong fruit (pineapple)/cough syrup tastes too, which although that does not sound good, it actually tastes better than it sounds. A decent mouthfeel, not as cloying as one would expect and a decent drinkability.



Thanks to Brian700 for the trade."
Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,Fort,,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,18.00%,bottle,3.03,2.5,4,3,2.5,2.5,9/4/2006,"$15.99, Brawleys, Charlotte, NC, USA. 750 mL bottle, bought in Jan 2006, consumed September 2006.
Dark orange pour with an initial small head but obviously this fades really quickly. Aroma has the advertised raspberries which are certainly evident in the taste too, but even the strong fruit presence is overwhelmed by the alcohol. Not a lot else, just plenty of waming alcohol. Nice combination of sweet and tart.
Not much here other than the alcohol. It drinks below its 18%, but at the same time the booze is very prevelant.
At this price, forget it. I generally enjoy DFH and their philosophy and also many of their beers, but this is definitely poor value for money and a very ordinary beer to boot."
Butte Creek Brewing Company,Butte Creek Organic Revolution X Imperial IPA,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,9.10%,bottle,2.28,3.5,3.5,2,2,1.5,9/3/2006,"22oz Bomber. Green's, Buford Highway, Atlanta, GA, USA.



Mid amber/orange body with a degree of chill haze and some persistent carbonation. Half inch head that is decent and immediately leaves some nice, if somewhat scant lacing. 



Sugary sweet hops in the nose.



Complex or just a mess? Frankly it's difficult to tell. There are three things desperately competing for my attention. A sickly sweet malt base, some astringent sugared grapefruit hops and a high level of alcohol that is not well hidden. That combination doesn't really make for a very attractive beer.



Way too sweet, even for my sweet tooth, and the package seems hurriedly put together. Unbalanced and it gives the impression that this is a big beer for big beers sake. Failed to finish half of the bottle, not because I couldn't manage it, but becasue it really wasn't nice to drink."
Great Divide Brewing Company,Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout,,,Russian Imperial Stout,9.50%,on-tap,4.03,4.5,4,4,4,4,9/3/2006,"$6.75 on tap at Taco Mac, East West Connector, Atlanta, GA, USA. 



Jet black pour - opaque. Smallish head, but nice lace lacing and a ying-yang symbol forms in light brown bubbles on the surface of the beer. Silky milk chocolate mouthfeel with a hint of mild tobacco??



Aftertaste is all evaporating alcohol, almost as if you can feel the alcohol rising to the roof of the mouth and in the back of the throat. There is more of a mouth and tongue coating with the draft version than the bottle but it is still very light. Rich.



Combination of all of the above bring a very nice beer together. One pint is plenty, and I liked the draft version much better than the bottle."
O'Hanlon's Brewing Co. Ltd.,Thomas Hardy's Ale (2003-2008),,,Old Ale,11.90%,bottle,2.63,1.5,4.5,2,3.5,2,9/3/2006,"8.5 fl oz. bottle, 2004 vintage, serial No. P 58218, Green's, Ponce de Leon, Atlanta, GA, USA. $5.95. Label says 11.7 % ABV.
It's probably close to eight years ago that I last drink this, so my memories of the stuff earlier than 1998 are a little faded, but even if that is the case I was still bitterly disappointed by the bottle of the 2004 vintage that I recently drank.
Very unattractive pour on three levels. Firstly the color was that of stale, cold tea, secondly there was a suspicious looking murkiness to it and thirdly the lack of life in the pour was alarming. Don't get me wrong, at 11. something% and with the style taken into consideration I was not expecting visual fireworks, but I just don't recall this looking so drab in the past.
Anyway, getting on with the important stuff the nose was as expected, wonderful. A combination of alcohol soaked fruits and dark sherries and ports lifted my spirits. Alas, the taste failed to match that by some significant distance. It had an initial burst of what I was expecting - a reflection of the nose - but then there came this nasty lack of balance with a very strong soap taste that I can only assume was the hops asserting themselves. Very off-putting and completely overwhelmed the rest of the beer. Soap, soap, soap!
Mouthfeel was as expected with a sweet, cloying coating, but not unpleasant.
I dunno, maybe my rose tinted memories are playing tricks with me, maybe this is simply too young, or maybe O'Hanlon's have really f'ed this up, whichever is true, for now at least, I will not be drinking any more TH vintages with less than 5 years under their belt."
Pivzavod Baltika / Baltic Beverages Holding,Baltika #5 Gold,,,Euro Pale Lager,5.30%,bottle,2.93,3.5,2,3,3,3.5,9/3/2006,"Part of what appears to be a renewed marketing drive on the Baltika products in Georgia, this appeared with a large range of Baltika beers, that from memory, have been slightly repackaged and spruced up.



500 mL clear glass bottle (sensitive folks can start to panic) it really has a very attractive bright golden hue. Unfortunately - and utterly predictably - this is where the attraction largely ends! Head is short lived and lacing is virtually non-existent.



Aromas and tastes are exactly in line with the expectations. Corny vegetable sweetness and completely bland in all other respects. On the plus side no offensive alcohol edge or skunk and quite refreshing.



Quite how one would distinguish this from literally thousands of other similar products is beyond me, but for what it is I suppose it's OK. As long as you have low expectations they will probably be fulfilled."
Browar Okocim S.A. (Carlsberg),Okocim Porter,,,Baltic Porter,8.10%,bottle,4.58,4.5,4,5,4,4.5,8/31/2006,"500 mL bottle with a slightly different label than the one pictured. 8.3% ABV noted on this label.



Dark mahogany with plenty of red highlights. Aroma is amazingly rich with plenty of whisky and alcoholic notes competing for my attention.



Tastes are extraordinarily rich with waves and waves of dark fruits, alcohol and scotch whisky rolling over the tongue in a wonderful warming and rich manner. Delicious burnt chocolate in the finish.



Amazingly rich and great depth. I was amazed at how rich and satisfying this was. Less of a Porter in my mind, much more like an Old Ale or Bourbon Aged dark brew."
"Lion Brewery, Inc.",Stegmaier Brewhouse Bock,,,Bock,6.60%,bottle,3.83,2.5,3.5,4,4,4,8/30/2006,"Thanks to SilentSabre and the BeerBeing for hooking me up with this.



Orange amber pour with minimal lacing and head. Frankly bit flat looking. It looks a bit thin too, but it drinks better than that would initially suggest.



Nice, rich caramel, toffee cream flavors and a full sweet mouthfeel make this drink much better than it looks. Creaminess is certainly the main event here and it is very round. Malty and distinct lack of hop bitterness in keeping with the style. The nose offers up some sweet bourbon type alcohol.



If this looked better it really would be a cracking Bock, as it is it is very nice but let down by the lack of carbonation and therefore by its appearance. When I poured this I thought I was going to be disappointed but it drank above expectations."
BridgePort Brewing Co. / Brewpub + Bakery,Bridgeport ESB,,,Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB),6.10%,bottle,3.48,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,8/27/2006,"Mid-amber pour with a lack of sustainable head and little lacing.



Average example, with solid malt and some balance. Sweet biscuit aromas and tastes, and drinkable. Outside of that, not much to report here.



Sessionable potential, but a distinct lack of depth for the style. I need a much more complex beer in this style and this is rather bland. Not bad, and better than some, but lacks punch and character.



Enjoy the Bridgeport bottle presentations."
Lagunitas Brewing Company,Freak Out Ale,,,American IPA,7.30%,bottle,3.8,3,3.5,4,3.5,4,8/27/2006,"Lagunitas arrived in GA for the first time this week, and although I've had a few of their offerings before, I was happy to snag this new one at Green's, Buford Highway, Atlanta, GA, USA for $2.99 for the 22oz bomber. Homage being paid to Frank Zappa & The Mothers.



Poured into a pint glass. Very, very light orange pour. Smallish head with a little lacing. Nose has a little hop character but not much.



Taste is an interesting combination of grapefruit hops and some sweetness in the middle. The finish has a satisfying bitterness. Some metallic notes and the mouthfeel is nice - not spectacular, but better than average. Aftertaste lingers pleasantly.



I like it and the alcohol is well hidden, this drinks much more like a sessionable 5% beer to me, so just be a little careful!"

Founders Brewing Company,Founders Red's Rye PA,,,Rye Beer,6.60%,bottle,4.43,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,8/26/2006,"Thanks go out to Brian700 for the trade.



Fantastic looking pour with a massive rocky head that has great retention. Copper red body with a lot of clarity. Lovely sticky lacing left behind. Looks? It's a 5!



Big hops, but it's really mellow - not astrigent at all. Couple this with magnificent malts and a subtle rye flavor and you have one delicious beer. Beautifully full hop burps are induced as I gulp this one down.



Very satisfying and smooth the mouthfeel is both silky and light, but it also gives a fullness that seems in direct contradiction to that. Whatever it does to achieve this, it works very well.



Frankly a real all around winner. A multi-faceted beer with a lot to offer. Very nice.



The second bottle of this gave me a much greater Rye taste than the original bottle from the same pack, and I liked it a little less. Still nice, but a little more bitter."

Brouwerij De Dolle Brouwers,De Dolle Stille Nacht,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,12.00%,bottle,3.93,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,8/20/2006,"11.6 oz bottle poured into the Val-Dieu Chalice.



Deep orange, dark honey colored pour. Decent head, but it fades to leave a little lacing and some spotty film. Hazed effect. Nowhere near dark enough to be a ""dark"" Belgian, but at the same time a little more color than a pale. A bit of a hybrid.



A lot of alcohol and yeast notes in the nose.



After that it's all sweet fruits with some tart tastes. Apple and pineapple are also present. Silky and smooth in the mouth. It's pretty sweet though to the point of making it outside of some peoples range.



Nice, but not my favorite Belgian by some distance."
Weyerbacher Brewing Co.,Black Hole,,,Old Ale,7.00%,bottle,3.63,3,4,3.5,4,3.5,8/20/2006,"Old Ale? Nah, it's a Porter for all intents and purposes.



Black pour with an initial large tan head but this fades fast to leave a tiny bit of lacing and some minimal spotty head on the surface.



Nice, rich chocolate alcohol nose.



Decent mouthfeel with some warming alcohol and dry cocoa notes. Slightly acidic bitter finish, again with a powdery chocolate feel.



If this were advertised as a Porter it would be nice, but as an Old Ale it's hopeless. Does that matter? I guess not, but it puts a different and difficult spin on the review.



Thanks to SilentSabre and ultimately the BeerBeing for the opportunity to try."
High Point Brewing Company,Ramstein Winter Wheat,,,Weizenbock,9.50%,bottle,3.2,3,3.5,3,4,3,8/19/2006,"One of my favorite styles.



Thanks to Matt (AKA SilentSabre), and ultimately BeerBeing.



Poured into the Tucher Weizen glass, it's pretty much all black with a few brown highlights at the edges. Nice half-inch tan colored head forms on the pour, but this VERY quickly fades to absolutely NOTHING - I mean nothing, not even a spotty film - very disappointing. As a result of the wimpy pour, absoultely no lacing either. After that it sits there, looking like a coke.



Nose is pretty alcoholic with some bananas. Mouthfeel is good, quite rich and smooth.



Taste hightlights the alcohol and not much else. Warming on the way down, but generally disappointing. Some smoke?? Not at all complex or interesting.



I dunno, just one of those beers that failed to meet the hype for me. That in itself is not that unusual, but I guess the fact that this is a style that I really like, made it feel more of a let down. Ho Hum."
Innis & Gunn,Innis And Gunn Oak Aged Beer,,,English Pale Ale,6.60%,bottle,4.83,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,8/19/2006,"11.2 oz clear (get over it) bottle. Great presentation. $4.99, Green's, Ponce de Leon, Atlanta, GA, USA.
Light orange color with a nice head and some of the best lacing I have seen in a while.
Caramel popcorn dominates the nose. Delicious.
This is liquid honey! Amazingly subtlely sweet and smooth. The taste is amazing. A great balance of malt and alcohol with a drier than expected bitterish finish. I don't really get the oak barrels in the taste, but there is a huge vanilla flavor imparted to the beer from that conditioning. Nectar.
This combines all the drinkability and subtlety of a high quality British Pale Ale with a delicious sweet honey taste and super balance. Outstanding in the style and something you should try soon."
North Coast Brewing Co.,Brother Thelonious,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,9.40%,bottle,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,8/18/2006,"***Since my initial review, I think that this beer has been re-categorized as a Dubbel which seems more appropriate.
Corked and caged 750 mL, purchased from Hiram Bottle Shop, Hiram, GA, USA from fellow BA, SilentSabre.
Great rust color with some lovely red highlights. Nice head on the initial pour but this fades quickly. Good, rich caramel nose with a hint of alcohol.
Taste is surprisingly light on the alcohol. At 9.00% ABV I was expecting a lot more in the taste, but it is hidden to the point of feeling much less than this. All in all this is very sweet, that's not a problem for me, but it makes for a beer that is slightly out of style.
Interesting, but this lacks the depth of a true Belgian dark***. Maybe some age and some tweaking can turn this into something special, but for now, whilst OK, it's a bit of an also ran."
Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,Immort Ale,,,American Strong Ale,11.00%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,8/17/2006,"Bottled 04/05/06 (stamp on neck). 12 oz bottle.



Crystal clear, copper colored pour with a small amount of carbonation at first, but this, like the small head, fades very quickly. 



As others have noted, a certain brandy like aroma.



Definite smokiness in the taste (the oak?), along with plenty of alcohol, but it drinks suprisingly smoothly. I think the smoothness is due to the vanilla and maple advertised on the label, but it doesn't really manifest itself as a taste, more of a ""feeling"". Actually rather fruity. Mouthfeel is slick, and that's fine considering the ABV, and to be honest it's actually rather nice - not cloying at all.



Nice beer, but too strong for me to enjoy more than one of in any one session. Another example of DFH's innovation. They truly are a brewery at the cutting edge of American 21st century brewing."
Brouwerij Van Honsebrouck N.V.,Kasteel Donker,,,Quadrupel (Quad),11.00%,bottle,4.7,4,4,5,4.5,5,8/13/2006,"$3.99 special price for a 750 mL bottle at Whitlock Package, Whitlock Avenue, Marietta, GA, USA. Poured into the Duvel tulip.



Champagne bottle presentation going beyond just corked and caged with gold foil down the length of the neck and with a dimpled bottom of the bottle. Corked has 11-2003 on it so this is close to three years old.



Apart from the color (another dirty brown opaque, Dubbel type pour) it looks great. BIg head and great lacing. If this had the color of a Belgian Pale I would give it a 5, but for now the dirt color marks it down.



Nose has alcohol but also a tart citrus nature. The citrus is definitely NOT carried through to the taste.



The taste is very sweet and complex. Huge sugars and fruits overlapping one another with a Belgian yeast background makes this a BIG beer. The sweetness will kill it for some people, but if you like sweet, you'll love this.



A little alcohol burn in the finish. 11%?? It drinks nowhere near that though. This is a very dangerous beer!



At $3.99 for 750 mL this may be the best value beer I have EVER purchased!"
"Middle Ages Brewing Co., Ltd.",Tripel Crown,,,Tripel,10.20%,bottle,3,3,3,3,3,3,8/11/2006,"$6.99, Michael's Beer and Wine, Marietta, GA, USA. Not sure about the age of this 4 pack, but at the same time this should be OK for some time.
Quite what this is, or indeed is supposed to be, I'm not at all sure. The label says ""British Style Ale"", and it is classified here as a Tripel. I'm not at all sure where those two boundaries meet, in fact, I don't think that they do at all!
Golden viscous pour with a poorly retained head and no lace. Fair enough, at &gt;10% ABV I was not expecting much. Nose is basically sugared alcohol and not much else. Tastes reflect those attributes with some burning alcohol and a sweet tripel twang. Not much else. Finish is burning and dry.
I think this is much closer to an English Barleywine - high alcohol without the hops."
Daleside Brewery,Old Leg Over,,,English Bitter,4.10%,bottle,4.28,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,8/10/2006,"Presented in a 500 mL brown bottle (that will please some, but matters little to me) with a slightly updated label compared to the BA database picture. Lots of information on the label too.
Lovely clear mid-amber pour with a nice head and some lovely lacing. This is a mild beer in all respects, and will probably be horribly under appreciated in the US.
Well, this is a typical English Pale Ale with plenty of lovely soft biscuit malts, delicate mouthfeel and excellent drinkability. With an ABV of 4.1% ABV, this is about as low as you can go and still have the complete, full-on hop package. As well as the ABV being delicate, the hop profile is also minimal at best. Having said that it all comes together very nicely.
Lovely sweet aftertaste and it's gone before I know it."
SweetWater Brewing Company,Sweetwater IPA,,,American IPA,6.70%,on-tap,4.05,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,8/10/2006,"Living in Atlanta it's sometimes easy to forget what a nice beer this is, especially when fresh and on tap. I had one of these at Mellow Mushroom in Douglasville, GA, USA for $3.50 for 16 oz.
Color is more orange than one would necessarily expect and the aroma releases the hops. Initial tastes are hop based with a mild sugared grapefruit metallic twang. It finishes way sweeter than the initial palate would suggest, but it makes this a really quaffable brew.
Served way too cold, but after 20 minutes this is drinking perfectly. Same characteristics as the bottle, but the tap just seems to add a little something to this beer."
The Duck-Rabbit Craft Brewery,Duck-Rabbit Brown Ale,,,American Brown Ale,5.60%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,8/10/2006,"Single 12 oz botle from Riverside, Chattanooga, TN, USA. Delicious. Dark red pour with the odd combination of not much persistent head but some really nice lacing. Carbonation is low.



Nutty, sweet and wonderful caramel aromas, exactly what I am looking for in a brown ale. Tastes do not quite reflect the malt or the sweetness. I get a much drier and hoppier finish than I was anticipating, but this unexpected trait brings balance.



Drinkability is good, and the single bottle I had leaves me wanting more. I could see myself putting a few of these away without much trouble. Nice American version of a brown, I'd be happy to advocate this beer."
Avery Brewing Company,Mephistopheles' Stout,,,American Double / Imperial Stout,15.10%,bottle,3.93,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,8/8/2006,"Bottled January 2006, Batch 1.
My oh my! In the wake of Samael's & The Beast, I was thinking that Avery had just about covered the bases on MASSIVE beers, but this went to a new level.
Poured from the 12 oz bottle into the Gouden Carolus mini-chalice it essentially had a body that is equivalent to motor oil, with a milk chocolate bubbly head that is quickly gone. Very little lace.
Aroma has strong but not overpowering alcohol, but it is intensely sweet. I mean SWEET, and that's coming from someone who generally enjoys sweet beers.
On to the taste - well it's definitely in the soy sauce/Teriyaki/Worcester sauce category with excess alcohol added! The sweetness is HUGE, even by my standards. Chocolate covered raisins with a little smoke too.
As usual, I was drinking a 16 oz glass of water with my 12 oz of beer, but I found myself drinking over twice as much water with these 12 oz. Like several of the other Avery massive brews the 12 oz could easily be split amongst two BA's.
Obviously a sipper, but it lacks the drinkability of the two other big hitters from Avery, The Beast and Samael's and I enjoyed it slightly less than those two. Having said that, this really is a ""must try at least once"" beer."
Williams Brothers Brewing Company,Ebulum Elderberry Black Ale,,,Scottish Gruit / Ancient Herbed Ale,6.50%,bottle,3.6,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,8/7/2006,"$2.49 single from Ziggy's in Chattanooga, TN, USA. Dark, dark mahogany pour with very little head or lacing. Alcohol and fruits are very strong in the nose, but the alcohol is not carried into the taste.



Medicinal notes with grape skins. Berry tastes underpin the whole thing with some mild alcohol hanging around in the background.



Light mouthfeel, dry and tart finish.



Apparently best before April 2005. Oh well still drinkable."
Great Divide Brewing Company,HotShot ESB,,,Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB),5.00%,bottle,3.85,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,8/5/2006,"12 oz bought as a single from Riverside, Chattanooga, TN, USA. Nice color and design on the label.
Large, frothy light head with a soapy texture. This is in line with the taste which is also somewhat soapy in nature. Biscuit aroma's come from the amber body with some significant carbonation making this beer an above average looker. Initial sweet malts balanced nicely with a hop ending that is fairly short.
Good drinkability, sessionable qualities and everyday potential."
Lost Coast Brewery and Cafe,Downtown Brown,,,English Brown Ale,5.00%,bottle,3.85,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,8/5/2006,"Purchased as a single from Riverside, Chattanooga, TN, USA. 12 oz stubbie.



One of my favorite styles and this is better than average.



Excellent brown color with minimal head but better than average lacing. The color makes up for the lack of head. Woody and nutty it its initial aroma, and then the sweet malts back up everything in the taste. Really rather nicely rounded and tasty.



Like the style? Get some soon."
Unibroue,Unibroue 15,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,10.00%,bottle,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,8/4/2006,"Corked and caged 750 mL brown bottle with screen-printed label. Bullock's, Marietta, GA, USA. Opens with a gentle ""pop"" and some champagne like vapors.



Poured into the Gouden Carolus flute. Orange butterscotch pour with a large white, dense head and some lacing. Carbonation is good. Alcoholic pepper notes dominate the nose. Tastes are dominated by hard, winter fruits; apples, gooseberries & pears. The obvious yeast and alcohol Belgian influenced overtones are present. The spices are difficult for me to pin down but I get a distinct orange/clove taste - reminiscent of a mulled wine cocktail, with the addition of citrus or satsuma's. A bit of Christmas.



Velvet soft carbonation and body - delicious. Mouthfeel is sumpuous.



Immensely quaffable and at 10% ABV you need to be careful."
Brouwerij Bavik,Petrus Speciale,,,Belgian Dark Ale,6.50%,bottle,2.48,3,2.5,2.5,2,2.5,8/3/2006,"Overall a rather disappointing experience. Special? I don't think so. Belgian Dark? Not in my book.



Poured into the Brasserie de l'Abbaye des Rocs chalice I get a golden body with thin, watery lacing. That's fitting because the whole experience is somewhat thin and watery. Lack of body, taste and alcohol makes for a letdown. Dry bitters in the taste and the finish, a metallic twang and little less apart from some citrus (mainly lemon) notes.



It lacks a lot of the sweet and spice notes and the body is woefully weak for the style. Tasted like a watered down strong Euro Lager."
Moorhouse's Brewery (Burnley) Ltd,Pendle Witches Brew,,,English Pale Ale,5.10%,bottle,4.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,8/3/2006,"500 mL bottle from Riverside in Chattanooga, TN, USA.



Different label than the one depicted in the BA database, this is the purple and gold one on the brewery web site. Slightly hazed orange honey pour with a small white head and some decent lacing. Suprisingly some persistent carbonation too.



All the attributes that one would expect for the style are there. Creamy mouthfeel with oodles of bread based malts. Hops are in the background perfectly married with the sweeter nuances. A little drier than I was anticipating, but still fantastic.



As usual wih this kind of beer I could drink this all day and all night long. absoluely delicious. Easy to drink and very pleasing."
Brasserie Fantôme,Fantôme Saison,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,8.00%,bottle,4.13,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,8/2/2006,"Capped and corked 750 mL bottle. Poured into the oversized wine glass. Hazed and clouded orange body with a delicious looking head. The head is dense and deep with wonderful retention and lacing.



The usual funk and rustic manure type smells and apples in the initial up front tastes. Lots of dry, pineapple in the nose and the taste, in fact all around a little drier than I expected.



Drinkability is high, and before I know it the 750 mL has gone. Tasty, refreshinga and creamy."
The Duck-Rabbit Craft Brewery,Duck-Rabbit Amber Ale,,,American Amber / Red Ale,5.50%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,8/2/2006,"Picked up as a single from Riverside in Chattanooga, TN, USA. Great metallic copper colored body with a small but attractive light brown head the lingers to leave minimal lace. Some pretty good carbonation rises in the glass.



Characterful drink with an obvious malt/sweet backbone, but with some hops layered on top. Roasted caramel present too. Very drinkable with a nice clean dry finish typical of the style. A few nutty flavors in there too that remind me of a brown ale hybrid. Nice job.



Very nice, definitely worth a shot."

As usual with a Dubbel, not very attractive to me. Very fizzy (loud) out of the bottle, but the head disappears quickly.



Excellent, sweet alcohol and caramel aroma. Tastes are just the same, sweet caramel, but with a warming alcohol finish and a bit more of a watery feel than I was expecting.



Dry alcohol finishes quickly."
Big River Grille & Brewing Works,House Brand IPA,,,American IPA,6.00%,on-tap,3.6,4.5,3,3.5,4,4,7/30/2006,"Pours light orange/copper with a surprising amount of alcohol in the nose. Upfront tastes are dry hops immediately and then some softer malts later. Finishes with some sweet sherry alcohol notes. Some excellent lacing makes this very attractive.



I was surprised at the alcohol taste of this beer - it was quite noticeable considering both the ABV and the style. A simple IPA in the English, rather than the American style. Nice, drinkable and I enjoyed it."
Big River Grille & Brewing Works,Imperial 375 Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),5.30%,on-tap,3.35,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,7/30/2006,"Light colored body with some excellent lacing. Simple hop profile in the nose with a nice malt balance. I got an amazing blue cheese taste from this beer!! Who'd have thought?? Anyway, drinkable with an interesting aftertaste - not unpleasant but a little odd. This detracts a little from the drinkability, but still an interesting beer and worth a try."
Big River Grille & Brewing Works,Big River Vienna Lager,,,Vienna Lager,5.20%,on-tap,3.65,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,7/30/2006,"Lovely looker with a light amber color and some first class lacing. Malts are all upfront that are complemented by a nice balance on the dry hopped finish. A little metal in there too on the quick finish that reminds you that this is a lager despite the richer looking color.



Clean, crisp and refreshing, I could easily put a few of these away without really noticing much!"
Big River Grille & Brewing Works,Southern Flyer Light Lager,,,Light Lager,3.70%,on-tap,2.2,2,2,2,2,3,7/30/2006,"Yikes! Is it Ginger Ale?? It has an almost transparent appearance with a slight yellow tinge. Has a large head and a very fizzy appearance. Very, very light tastes of citrus with almost lemonade notes. This is just about as close to a non-alcoholic beer (that actually DOES have alcohol) that one can get. Not only is is 3.67% ABV, it also tastes of nothing much and honestly looks pretty close to water. Amazing clarity and lack of color!



Not my thing, but in the land of light lager this isn't bad. No skunk, no nasty aftertaste, pretty clean and refreshing, so I suppose it does the job for those that want this sort of thing. 



Not much point in drinking it under the category of beer though - one for the ladies I suppose?"
Great Divide Brewing Company,Denver Pale Ale,,,English Pale Ale,5.40%,bottle,3.08,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,7/30/2006,"I like the presentation (the labels) on the Great Divide range - simple and striking, especially the colors.
Pale orange pour with not much head or lacing but it does leave a nice thin film on the surface of the body. Fine bubbles of carbonation persist.
Sweet grass in the nose. The tastes are rather soapy in their hop nature. Good malt and hop balance are the keys to the success of this beer. Despite the balance there is a small bitter hop finish that lingers and warms. As it warms the hops seem to get stronger.
Sessionable (by American standards) and crossover qualities/potential."
Unibroue,Noire De Chambly / Chambly Noire,,,Belgian Dark Ale,6.20%,bottle,4.25,4.5,4,4.5,3,4.5,7/30/2006,"Thanks to zrrbrrt for the trade (this was before this got to Atlanta). 750 mL corked and caged.
Poured into the Duvel tulip, the color is VERY black, almost of Guinness proportions, and is completely opaque without a hint of any other kind of colored highlights. Thin creamy layer of head on the surface of the black body.
Well, no mystery here. Typical Dark Belgian attributes all over the place from the aroma to the tastes. Yeast and spice with a couple of slight differences. Mouthfeel and alcohol are both below what I would normally expect. Now, that can be taken one of two ways - either it is a bit disappointing, or it makes it easier to drink and a little more refreshing than most of the style. For now, it doesn't bother me and it is a refreshing change. Plenty of dark fruits hit the tongue after a very brief initial bitterness. An extremely tasty beer.
I would say this is slightly outside the norm, almost like a ""light"" Dark Belgian. Makes it an interesting choice for a hot day in Georgia."
Big River Grille & Brewing Works,Iron Horse Stout,,,American Stout,5.70%,on-tap,3.55,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,7/29/2006,"Black with ruby port colored highlights. Mouthfeel and body is very, very light but surprisingly (especially for a stout) this does not really detract from the beer. Some alcohol with roasted rather than bitter flavors.



Some Porter tendncies, this is a light stout that doesn't really suffer from this lack of depth. Smooth and drinkable, I enjoyed it.



Apparently a gold medal winner in the sweet stout category at the 2004 Beer World Cup."
Manav Breweries Pvt. Ltd.,Karma,,,American Adjunct Lager,4.80%,bottle,2.6,2,2,3,2.5,2.5,7/29/2006,"650 ml brown tapered bottle with foil on the neck and cap and Indian accented label. High carbonation on the pour, with a really noisy, fizzy head. Some minimal retention and a *tiny* bit of lacing.



Outside of that, this is essentially a adjunct/macro lager. Lots of sweet aroma and corn based tastes with some alcohol. Quite refeshing, but not very clean, so this beer fails on one of my two criteria for a decent macro/adjunct. On the plus side there is a lack of skunk - not a lack of sweet corn - but a lack of skunk.



Utterly forgettable and I doubt that I will drink this again, but I was happy to try it once."
Pivzavod Baltika / Baltic Beverages Holding,Baltika #9 Extra (Strong),,,Euro Strong Lager,8.00%,bottle,2.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,2,7/26/2006,"500 mL bottle with repackaged labelling for a new assault on the US market I guess. Arbor Place, Douglasville, GA, USA, approx. $2.99.



Clean pour, aroma and look, with, as expected, some initial strong lacing and head that fades to nothing very quickly. A lot of corny alcohol in the nose with (happily) no skunk. Alcohol is definitely the main player in the taste too. Cloying sweetness that is close to too much, but is bearable as long as you don't mind really sweet beers.



Drinkability is not high, 500 mL of this stuff and you've had enough. If I had to categorize it, I might call it a this a high class 40oz malt liquor! Hard rinking, high alcohol lager bomb with no much to endear it to a BA."

Poured into the small Gouden Carolus chalice, the color is striking - a golden yellow slightly chill hazed body with some very light, creamy, fluffy head and the thin lace that you would associate with such a fine head. Some mild persistent carbonation.
Some alcoholic yeasts and clove drenched pineapple in the nose.
Sweet, mildly peppered alcohol is the classic Tripel taste, just a typical example. Lots of soft, tropical fruit is there too, with some mango and dry grape.
Finishes with a peppery, dry note to round it out perfectly."

Hazed orange pour with a good head and some nice lacing. Frankly this looks pretty good. After that, well, it's a bit of a mess. Mint and more profoundly very strong medicinal tones in the nose and taste. These very odd aromas and flavors are very difficult to get beyond and this makes this difficult to drink. The best way I can describe it is as sweet child's medicine. Reminded me of the infamous Cherry Wheat in some respects!
Pretty nasty, and although there is some good intent behind this brew, I am surprised that after tasting it, the BBC and Jim Koch would actually inflict this upon the population. Not good."

Thanks to Brewfan for another chance to taste this. 
This time the the beer lacks the clarity that I reported before, but this time the head and lace are (apparently) better. Good balance and a certain herbal quality remains.

12oz can, thanks to BA sulldaddy for the excellent trade.
Poured into the Atlanta Brewing Red Brick Ale pint glass. Head is initially good but fades fast to nothing. A small ring of lace remains on the surface of the beer. 
Another solid, everyday drinking kind of IPA for me. Crystal clear amber body with the minimum of carbonation. Good herbal, hoppy aroma eminates from the glass and the mild tastes make this a simple, but effective beer. Slight lingering bitterness in the finish, it melds together nicely for a delicious experience. Some grapefruit and bitterness in there but very little.
Crisp and clean, another nicely put together beer, and in a can as well! Some nice hoppy burps too!"

I suppose that you might want to put this in the ""West Coast"" APA category since it has a pretty high hop intensity for an APA. Don't get me wrong, this is not an IPA, but at the same time there is a much greater hop presence than I would normally associate with the style.



Huge carbonation (a little annoying if I'm honest) sits on top of the cloudy orange body. Once the froth has died down it looks good. Mild citrus dominates but this is a very rounded beer. Drinking is very easy and the manageable ABV puts this down as a potential session brew. Sweet and smooth in the finish, I enjoyed it. The kind of beer that could become an everyday favorite if I was local."

Purchased at Kybecca, Fredericksburg, VA, USA. $7+ for the last bottle in the cooler.
Poured in to the Val-Dieu goblet. Still has the dark, dark brown almost black body. Very thin spotty head despite the aggressive pour. Some flakes and floaties in the body of the pour.
Aroma is deeper now than I remember from a couple of years ago. Mouthfeel is still creamy.
The taste really doesn't seemed to have mellowed out much - a tad disappointing. It certainly maintains that aniseed bitterness that I thought might have been tempered down somewhat.
Still enjoyed it, but I am a little surprised that this had not changed more. Still a bit edgy - I'd like to see a mellower Belgian.

22oz bomber. Thanks to BA Boolshot for a great trade.
Dark, dark brown in the Chimay chalice. Tan head that is not very impressive, somewhat thin and leaves a little spottiness on the surface. Alcohol in the nose with some typical Belgian sugar, spice and yeast notes.
As others have observed there is a definite aniseed taste in there somewhere. It manifests itself in some bitterness which seems a little out of place. Mouthfeel is luxurious and delicious. Outside of that it's typically spiced Belgian but with an unusual dark chocolate taste mixed in. Very nice.
The finish is too bitter in my opinion and lacks subtlety. I wouldn't be surprised if this mellowed over time and if it does, this beer would have improved a great deal. Despite all of that I found myself drinking this very quickly so it's obviously not all that bad!"
Left Hand Brewing Company,Twin Sisters Double IPA,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,9.00%,bottle,3.63,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,7/22/2006,"$9.99 Green's, Atlanta, GA, USA. 2006 bottle conditioned vintage, tall, longnecked, dark olive green bottle, 750 mL corked and caged with screened label. Pain in the ass, tightly twisted cage - the most difficult I have ever had to open. Anyway, moving on.



Hazy, burnt orange colored pour with a huge, dirty froth head (the kind you see at the beach). Poured into the Southampton Weizen glass, the beer slips under the head to enter the mouth without any head presence. A small amount of random lacing, but this is also very airy.



Nose is hoppy, but not big by the stanadards of most American DIPA's. Some alcohol in the nose, and this is replicted in the finish.



Alcoholic, sweet hops are the main tastes. There is no way that this is a hop bomb (because to me the alcohol is too evident), but it still is going to be pleasing to those seeking a big, bitter beer. A little thin and slick in the mouth - I was hoping for a fuller experience - this is this beers weak point.



It's nearly there, but to me the alcohol is a little too prominent in the profile and it overtakes what the brewer is (probably) trying to achieve which is much more of a hop beast. A little pricy too, this doesn't quite deliver, although it's still a nice beer."

Pour is a fantastic garnet color with great head, super lacing and great retention. All the characteristics of a big American DIPA are there. Very sweet malts are the backdrop and the hops are drippin' all over it. Resinous, green and clean.



Sharp and clean tastes give a serious refreshing edge.



The combination makes for a potent beer that drinks incredibly easy considering the style and the alcohol.



Another really nice offering from this brewery that continues to impress me."
Stone Brewing Co.,Stone 8th Anniversary Ale,,,American Brown Ale,7.80%,bottle,2.43,3,2,2.5,2.5,2.5,7/22/2006,"Thanks to Boolshot for a great trade. 22oz bomber.



This is not the best beer that I have had from Stone - not by long chalk. The main problem here is with the style. In a Brown Ale I'm looking for a simple, malt based (low hop presence) easy drinking beer with some sweet notes and probably a pretty low alcohol. This fails on three counts and as a result the drinkability is low. There is a high alcohol taste combined with a hoppy note, all amongst a chocolate-cocoa powedery mouthfeel. A poor combo under any circumstances but in a Brown Ale it's even worse.



Alcohol in the nose too - it's all a little too much.



Stone is a great brewer whom I have a lot of respect for and I love most of their beers, but this is not one of them. A blip."

English toffee colored pour with a lovely looking dense head and some really nice thick, creamy lacing. Body is clouded but good looking carbonation (a bit like a better looking, lighter Dubbel).
Nose has some really nice honey malts and a hint of alcohol.
Mouthfeel is good (a little silky even) and the tastes are a combination of slightly tart, sweet malts and some dry bock like character. Unusual and rather good.
Aftertaste has the sweet malts continuing to linger and a hint of dry hops. Very nice little package."
Brouwerij Van Honsebrouck N.V.,St. Louis Framboise,,,Lambic - Fruit,4.50%,bottle,4.15,4,4,4,3.5,5,7/19/2006,"My guess is, is that lots of people will not like this much. First off this is a VERY sweet beer. I like that, many will not. I like this type of beer for an occasional change of pace. Truth be known, it's really a girly beer, but every once in a while I don't mind something like it. I'm giving it a 5.0 for drinkability, BUT only on the understanding that even for me, in the wrong circumstances it could also be a 2.0!



Pour is certainly red, but it goes from a dark red when the oversized wineglass is full, to a slightly more pink color when it is nearly empty. Quite a lot of dark burgandy sediment form which looks a lot like fruit sediment. Plenty of good wispy lacing.



As far as the aroma goes there are rasperberries in the extreme, but to me it is not overwhelming or nasty.



Taste? Well, it's mega sweet and the ladies will LOVE this, and truth be known there is not much else. Not a complex or complicated brew at all, but a nice one-off desert beer. Try it at least once, if you hate it, fair enough, I think it's nice."
Christian Moerlein Brewing Company,Christian Moerlein Select Dunkel,,,Munich Dunkel Lager,?,bottle,2.98,3.5,3,3,2.5,3,7/18/2006,"Purchased at Reilly's in Hilton Head, South Carolina, USA in a six pack. I wonder of this stuff makes it to HHI specifically to appeal to the large number of Ohio residents that seem to congregate here in the summer?



I would describe this is as an above average version of the style. Nice looking brown pour with quite a lot of carbonation. Despite the carbonation the head fades diappointingly quickly though, especially considering the amount of froth that is generated from the opening the bottle.



Malty nose as expected, but the first sip reveals a mouthfeel that is too thin for me. Not overtly so, but definitely a little lacking. The lack of body hurts this beer. Tastes are similarly malt based, but a lack of bitterness and a general insipid experience combine to make this somewhat forgettable - not unpleasant, but just another average beer that you could easily knock up in your basement if you were a proficient homebrewer. Ho hum."

OK, there's not doubt that we've lost a lot of the hops in that time, but my, what a great beer we've gained! The malts have obviously come to the fore as one would expect, but the sweetness and the sharpness have been maintained and raised.



Pours with a HUGE frothy, red head that is so dense and sweet it reminds me of a beer milkshake. Underneath that, the beer has maintained its great, garnet color and the appearance is excellent.



This has become so malty, we might even rename it a Big Malty Monster - a REAL change over time."
Tyranena Brewing Company,Bitter Woman India Pale Ale,,,American IPA,5.80%,bottle,3.48,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,7/16/2006,"Thanks go out to flyingbison.



More of a golden pour than an orange one, this beer gives a small, light and frothy head rather than one with any density. Some nice lacing.



Definitely a West Coast feel about this very bitter IPA. It's in the American IPA tradition, with very strong accents on the metallic, grapefruit bitterness which is quite dry. Not a great deal of balance here which is fine as long as you are in the mood for a back of the tongue, bitter experience. This is not overly bitter but the lack of malt gives a singular experience. Mouthfeel is pretty thin too.



Dry and not much subtlety, the aftertaste remains very metallic. This is clearly a well crafted beer, but on a personal note this is a wee bit one dimensional for me. I very much enjoyed the one bottle I drank, but after it I was seeking something with more balance."

Another 22oz bomber. Thanks to Rustydiamond for the third chance to try this wonderful brew. Can't believe this is in SC but not in GA.
Head and lace are still thick and superb and with the rich, rust colored body this looks fantastic. I still feel this would be better thought of as an American Strong rather than an IPA, either way its RICH, BOLD and has a depth of character that is

22oz bomber, thanks to flyingbison for the trade. Subsequently from Solomon420 in July of 2007 which was split with a few kindred spirits at The Brick Store.
To call this an American IPA doesn't do it justice. This drinks like a BIG, BOLD American Strong Ale, something along the lines of an Arrogant Bastard.
This brew looks truly beautiful in the Tucher Weizen glass with a mid-amber pour, a lovely, thick dense head that hangs around for ages, and some really nice thick lacing.
Massive grapefruit and pine in the nose. Surprisingly the Rye is not there in much evidence, nor in the taste, but the hops are - My-oh-my, the hops are there! Potent, stinging bitterness that lingers perfectly. It drinks beyond its ABV and the tastes are truly large. Aftertaste is truly great - metallic, smooth, creamy bitternes - first class.
Caresses the mouth with its silky temptation, mouthfeel and drinkability are second to none.
As I said, this is really a Bastard clone which in my mind is a HUGE compliment. Best beer I've drunk in a long time - delicious."

Lots of hype about this beer so I have been keen to try it for some time. 12 oz bottle with the # 7398 printed on the rear label.



Chill-haze effect on the peach colored pour with a nice fluffy head. Unfortunately the head is lost quickly and the lacing is almost non-existent - a shame and I'm slightly disappointed for such a great *tasting* beer.



Aroma is very good with a sweet, and more importantly a balanced hop profile coming through strong. As in all good brews the taste reflects that with some super sweet hop notes. Some sugared grapefruit holds throughout the each mouthful with a lovely mild, lingering bitterness.



Drinkability is high. A very, very nice American IPA with a lot of credibility and taste."
Thomas Creek Brewery,Dockside Pilsner,,,German Pilsener,4.50%,bottle,2.2,2,2,2,3,2.5,7/14/2006,"Frankly I have almost no idea what this beer is supposed to be, but I can say one thing for certain, this doesn't taste ANYTHING like a German Pilsener!



Massive head, in fact the carbonation is annoying. Once it dies down then we get a disappointing amount of sustained head and very little (if any) lacing. Buttersotch yellow cloudy pour - where is the crystal clear body?



Aroma is a weird peppery, soapy mess.



Taste is ridiculously sweet. Not horrible becasue I like sweet beers, but in a Pils?? No sharp, clean bitter finish that I would normally associate with the style, so to me it's all over the place.



I have no idea what is going on here, and going by the four beers form this brewery that I have had so far, they have a LONG way to go to get it together. UGLY presentation (label) too!"

Opaque black body excpet for the bottom half inch of the glass where there is a detectable ruby red highlight package. Head is large and frothy but disappointingly short lived and no lace is apparent.
Medium body with very little carbonation. Definitely all dark roasted, chocolate malts but the nose is bigger than the taste. Slightly dry finish.
Drinkability is above average for me in terms of the style. I enjoyed this, and it went down quite well."

OK, here's the deal. Presented to me by a non-BA, and more often than not I would simply reject this, but as I have not yet formally reviewed it, I thought I should go ahead and record my thoughts.
Pour is actually quite good. A really nice head on top of the crystal clear, light yellow body. No skunk, just mild alcohol and corn in the nose. To be honest, considering the style I would say the aroma was above average. The head however, fades in seconds rather than minutes.
Sweet notes are the initial tastes, but this fades quickly to a dry, clean finish. Not much else other than some mild alcohol, but really not at all bad.
I did not find this offensive in the slightest, and with the price and the ABV of 7.5% ABV you could do a heck of a lot worse. I'm not recommending it, but at the same time I would not totally dismiss this out of hand."

Head and retention are not quite as spectacular as predicted, but still better than average.
Nose is as expected, banana (mild), bread (stronger) and a little spice (maybe all spice) in there too. Light clove in nose and initial tastes. Sweeter in the mouth than the nose would suggest.
Refreshing and easy drinking, with lots of sweet wheat flavors. Fairly representative, but at the same time a little underwhelming. Could be another candidate that I expected too much from. Decent, but not great."

Pale lemon pour with not quite as much clarity as I was expecting. Lots of chill haze too, and a head that was not as lasting as I would have thought. Banana, pineapple and acid apples in the nose, and rather a lot of acidic apple in the taste too.



Mouthfeel was a little on the thin side as well.

Interesting. This drank like a ""baby"" Saison. Slight earthy farmhouse nose and tastes, but much sweeter with less funk and dry character. The typical robust, rustic notes were toned down to give a definite pineapple sweetness that was quite pronounced.
Good yellow color with nice head and lacing and some chill haze.
A good ""intro to a new style"" beer with plenty of crossover potential. Easy to drink, with the abiding memory being a light sweet, summer drinker."

Muted banana and clove aroma that is rather unusually NOT translated to the taste.



Light lemon taste with an absence of clove and banana on the tongue. Really quite acidic but at the same time it maintains its drinkability.

Dark brown tawny pour with ruby red highlights. Some head and some nice lacing. I am always intrigued by the aroma of beers like this one as the smells are intense, port like and seem to come from a beer maybe three or four times the ABV. I have no idea how the brewers manage to achieve this level of intensity of aroma from a beer that is 3.4% ABV!



You could drink this for days on end! Malts and sweet caramels are beautifully combined with creamy, dreamy mild bitterness. I can only imagine what this would be like on draft (if it exists in such a form) in a Lancashire pub. The mouthfeel is excpetional with a full and satisfying feel and the taste is divine. A great combo of balance and light smoke make this beer a classic in my book.

Nice looking beer with an excellent head and lacing. Served way, way too cold, I had to let this stand for about 15 minutes before the aroma and taste even began to manifest themeslves properly.



Very servicable Porter with a decent combination of chocolate malts, burned caramel and malts in the nose and the tastes. Did not finish too dry, which I like in my Porter's, and it maintained a nice level of creaminess; another good characteristic in my book.



Drinkability once the beer had warmed up was better than average and all in all I was pleased. I have been very unimpressed with TC so far, so it was nice to get this decent beer. Nothing to get too excited about yet, but a step in the right direction."

Aroma is malty and nutty. Tastes are in the dry category with an emphasis on cooking chocolate bitterness. As it warms increasing nut flavors come through to accent the malt. Mouthfeel perhaps a tad thin and I'd like a little more sweetness, but it's nothing to get too distressed over.



No the best Brown Ale, but a decent enough attempt and I would certainly visit this again when in the Carolina's."

Delicious and absolutely typical with one major exception - the appearance, especially the color. It was disappointing to me. It resembled one of the nasty, murky dirty water Dubbels that haunt me. Delicious head with an off-white solid foam forming tha moves with the beer. Lots of retentionand lacing it shows class.



Outside of the look all the dark fruits, alcohol and Belgian yeasts were present in abundance jus as expected. Multi-facetted layers of plums, figs, raisins and sugars are backed up by the Belgian yeast and the alcohol. It flows to the extent that it almost becomes something you can gulp down - I find myself picking up the glass time and time again.

As it sits the aroma rather oddly fades a little. Nice clarity in the body and some very mild but persistent carbonation in the form of small bubbles rising gently.



Taste is very hoppy, but it is dry and bitter. Taste lacks balance, but to be honest this is much more typical of the aggressive American IPA's. Long and lingering aftertaste hangs on for a long time.



Fairly aggressive in the hop department and a lack of malt balance, but if you are in the mood for some dry hops this wouldn't disappoint."

Very clean, tasty and refreshing, with a fuller mouthfeel than one would usually expect, but still very nice. Almost a litle creamy! I found the hops to be up front, more so than in several Pils, and there is a lack of bitterness in the finish which I would normally flag as a typical characteristic of the style.

Light, golden hue with decent carbonation. Surprisingly some lace present too. Taste has a little character, more than most for the style, but not much beyond what you would expect.

Very strong lemon aroma is all that hits me. The strength of the smell puts me off. Tastes are better, with the fruit flavor coming through strong, but there is a distinct lack of clove overtone.

Black pour, very still looking with a thin film of head. Disappointingly very little lacing too. Typical stout characteristics in the nose and tastes, with a mild chocolate roasted malt base being the most apparent. Our waiter suggested that this, ""could be a meal in itself""; well, perhaps if you were on a serious crash diet, this beer was way too thin for the style and lacked body and character.

Aroma was subdued malt with not much else present. Nice head, but his faded to nothing pretty quickly. No head and lace after a few minutes. 



I didn't get the ABV but found it easy to sink a few with not much effect or effort, so I suspect it was not especially high.

Drank more like an IPA than an APA to me, with more bitter hop flavor than I was expecting. Pretty good amber color with a decent head. Not much lacing.



Aroma was simple with some balance but not pronounced. The taste followed in the same vein but avoided being too dry and was astringent in just the right amount. Some nut character and the malt came through more than I was expecting to put it into a sort of weird Brown Ale/IPA hybrid category!

Good Lord, anything lighter and we'll have water! Anyway, typically macro in so many ways, all the way from the piss weak color, the lack of aroma and the utterly pointless taste. Non-offensive with no skunk is about the only good thing to say, although there is a pseudo hop bitterness that appears in the finish but is gone almost immediately.



Don't bother with this. Rather too predictable me thinks."
Brasserie St. Feuillien,St. Feuillien Cuvée De Noël,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,9.00%,bottle,4.3,4,4.5,4,4,5,6/27/2006,"750 mL corked and caged. Cork has 5/05 printed on it. Mid-brown body with a light film left on the surface of the beer after the light head has faded. Not much lacing when poured into the Brasserie de l'Abbaye des Roc goblet.



Big fruit alcoholic notes in the nose with a hint of spice. Tastes reflects that with plenty of sweet alcoholic notes, sweet fruit, spice and caramel toffee. The finish is what sets this apart from many others of a similar ilk. Very dry with almost a champagne like undertone.



Drinkability is huge, witht he 9.00 % apparent, but at the same time deliciously hidden.



Cracking beer that will doubtless benefit from some laying down but is obviously drinking beautifully relatively young too."
Brauerei Beck & Co.,Beck's Dark,,,Munich Dunkel Lager,4.80%,bottle,3.08,3.5,3,3,2.5,3.5,6/27/2006,"Dark amber pour with a small amount of carbonation that rises slowly. Some sticky lacing, but not much head - some lingers.



Solid malt backbone but this is limited by a thin body.



Quite a metallic and bitter aftertaste that does round out a little in the finish but leaves a lasting, not great impression.



OK in a squeeze, but lacks depth."
BridgePort Brewing Co. / Brewpub + Bakery,Black Strap Stout,,,American Stout,6.00%,bottle,4.05,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,6/27/2006,"Black pour with plenty of rum colored highlights. Nice persistent small head, with some creamy lacing.



Massive aroma is apparent as soon as the bottle is opened and is really rather surprising and impressive. Rich, sweet chocolate aromas are the most impressive.



Lots more creaminess than normal. Although this is thinner than a traditional stout in my view, it makes an absolutely delicious Porter! Nice alcohol presence too.



Absolutely no bitterness at all. Finishes long and smooth."

Low carbonation leads to a quickly disappearing head and no lacing - again, utterly typical.



Aroma is the adjunct, sweet grain and the taste follows directly behind. A little more alcohol in the nose than usual for the style and the taste has an alarming sweetness at first but does smooth out a little.



Well, what were you expecting? Fairly nasty stuff, but it doesn't pretend to be much else. It is what it is, a low quality macro lager."
Highland Brewing,Highland Kashmir IPA,,,American IPA,5.60%,bottle,3.4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,6/26/2006,"Attractive colored label on the 12oz bottle.



Very, very light golden color with some lager-like, high carbonation with fine lines of bubbles rising to add to the head. This is pretty persistent. The head is large and fluffy but not dense, and has a medium retention. A little (but not much) sticky lacing left behind.



Aroma is a subdued, malt & hop balance, not much else there. Mild hop grapefruit bitterness with a soapy like taste. Lingering bitterness in the finish. Smooth with some malt balance.



Nicely crafted IPA, but nothing special."
Goose Island Beer Co.,Bourbon County Brand Stout,,,American Double / Imperial Stout,13.00%,bottle,4.93,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,6/23/2006,"I knew this was going to be huge, and I was not disappointed. Inky black pour with a small tinge of cognac brown in a ring at the top of the pour after the dark tan head has disappeared.
The smell and the taste are quite exceptional. Layer after layer of bourbon, alcohol, vanilla, cream, chocolate and sugar. Amazingly complex and complete. Despite all of this, the beer is still exceptionally drinkable - by that I mean it is massive, but everything blends together perfectly to make you want to keep picking up the glass.
Mouthfeel is coating and luxurious. It definitely lacks the bitterness of a typical stout and drinks more like liquor!
Once I had finished my 12 oz bottle all I wanted was a great big glass of water to clean the palate, but the contrast perfectly framed this massive beer."
Brasserie Dubuisson Frères sprl,Bush De Noël,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,12.00%,bottle,3.63,2,4,3.5,3.5,4,6/22/2006,"750 mL bottle.



Lots of alcohol and quite thin. That's just about the total of my analysis of this. Light brown sugar colored body with a ridiculous snowstorm of yeasties. I've no problem with the unfiltered nature of the beer, but the appearance is not good, and the failure of the particles to settle puts me off (perhaps some coagulated proteins?)



Anyway, alcohol is very strong along with sugar and there is not a lot of flavor and subtlety outside of that. Still OK, but strong and not subtle - a bit of a let down."

Aroma is lots of malty alcohol, really rich. This beer has a certain fruitiness about it, but to call it a fruit beer does not do it justice at all. To me this drinks much more like an American Strong Ale - something akin to an Arrogant Bastard in fact. Sounds like a big claim, but I think it is justified.



Color is that beautiful, dark red rust, with a nice yellow fine bubbled head. There is a massive malt backbone against which hangs a fairly astringent bitterness. The bitterness probably comes in part from the fruit juice, but it manifests itself as a hop bitterness with a slight metallic twang. Lots of alcohol but it's fantastically crafted.



Really very impressed (again)."
Dark Horse Brewing Company,Dark Horse Reserve Special Black Bier Ale,,,American Strong Ale,7.50%,bottle,2.7,2.5,3,2.5,3.5,2.5,6/18/2006,"Thanks to Beerinator as part of XBIF 39.



Pour is jet black with a coffee colored head that is gone pretty quickly. Looks a bit flat to be honest.



Aroma and tastes are somewhat befuddled to me with too much going on. There's a fine line between complex and just a bitter, smoky, high alcohol cocktail and this crossed the line several times for me. Lots of important components there withour doubt, but it wasn't very well constructed in my opinion.



Certainly in the large department with tastes and body, but I thought it was somewhat unbalanced and just a bit too big in several areas."
Oskar Blues Grill & Brewery,Dale's Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),6.50%,can,4.53,5,4,4.5,4.5,5,6/18/2006,"Took me a little while to get around to drinking and reviewing this, but delighted that I eventually did.



$2.50 a can (on special??), Taco Mac, Douglasville, GA, USA.



To me this drinks much more like an IPA than an APA. In fact it is just like a slighted reduced version of the Gordon. Cracking good orange body with excellent head, retention and lacing. A lovely thing to behold.



Hops all the way with a satisfying bite and mouthfeel. I prefer this to many unbalanced American IPA's that I have come across, because the hops are still present in enough quantity to make you feel as if you are getting your fill, bu the beer has a balance that makes it amazingly drinkable."

Pour is very promising. Obviously the golden yellow color, but the head is impressive and lasting and the lacing is sticky and very attractive. However, that's where the attraction stops.



Amazing skunk of really, really sweet fructose corn and a taste to match. Very sickly sweet taste, and after 4 oz or so this went down the drain (a very, very, very rare event for me). Pilsener? Well, I get no dry, crisp hop profile, and vitually nothing else that I would characterize as Pils either, so I don't know.



Viscous mouthfeel, nasty smell and close to undrinkable. Looked good though!"

Black coffee colored with a head that disappears very quickly to leave no lacing or head. Sugary mouthfeel, but without the viscous feel. 
Liquorice taste with a dark burned, smoked malt background. Warming hop finish completes the package.

Sweet and sour flavors come through strong. Some very sweet malts initially and a pleasingly bitter finish. A slight metallic grapefruit aftertaste that is not really bad at all.



In no way is this my favorite style, but I was surprised at how nice and drinkable this was."
Atlantic Brewing Company,Bar Harbor Real Ale,,,English Brown Ale,5.20%,bottle,2.7,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,3,6/13/2006,"Nice color to the body, with some head, but this is gone way too soon to leave a little spotty head on the surface of the beer, but no lacing. Color is a deep red mahogany.



Nose has some caramel malts but not much at all.



Dryish and really quite bland. This drinks like a watered down brown ale, but without the malty, nutty flavors that one might expect. Flavor is just not quite there. It does improve somewhat on warming, but still lacks body and character.



Too thin for me, with a little bitterness and alcohol in the finish."
Thomas Hooker Ales & Lagers,Thomas Hooker Octoberfest Lager,,,Märzen / Oktoberfest,6.10%,bottle,3.13,2.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,6/13/2006,"Pretty standard offering in the style, not bad but nothing to write home about either. Pour was a little on the flat side for my liking against the clear amber body.



Standard nose with some spice and sweetness apparent. Taste had the usual characteristics one would expect, but had an odd earthy component too. A little off-putting. As with most Oktoberfests, as the warmth got into the beer the flavors became more pronounced.



OK, try one when you can, but don't expect anything more than a simple version of the style."
Hacker-Pschorr Bräu GmbH,Hacker-Pschorr Edelhell,,,Munich Helles Lager,5.50%,bottle,3.88,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,6/12/2006,"Butterscotch hazed pour with a small, but fluffy head. Not much lacing. Sweet malts and a little alcohol in the nose - not much but detectable.



Tasty hops, against a strong malt backbone with a dry and biting acidic finish. Smooth. The finish is particularly Pils like, with a clean bite. Tasty and a little different. Enjoyable."
Brouwerij Bavik,Petrus Aged Pale,,,Flanders Oud Bruin,7.30%,bottle,2.25,3,3.5,2,2,1.5,6/11/2006,"Well, for all intents and purposes this is a sour beer (flanders red or something similar) and to call it a Belgian Strong Pale is very misleading, even to an experienced drinker.



High, fizzy carbonation on the pour, but the head is gone as quick as a soda. Golden body. Smell is all funky, cider notes with some earthy notes too.



Taste is sour, with an emphasis on vinegar. Not my cup of tea, and to be honest I am a bit miffed at this being labeled the way it is - this is a Belgian Sour, not what you would expect from a strong pale at all."
Brouwerij Van Eecke N.V.,Poperings Hommel Bier,,,Belgian IPA,7.50%,bottle,4.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,6/11/2006,"Slender 330 mL bottle, Greens, Ponce De Leon, Atlanta, GA, USA.



Poured into the Duvel tulip, this creates an enormous, fluffy head with plenty of lacing. A cloudy and hazy honey color, this looks like a classic and typical Belgian Pale. Good looker.



Corriander spice notes in the nose. Taste is pronounced peppery and dry, with a hop finish that is very surprising for the style. Like De Ranke XX and Houblon Chouffe, this is a hoppy Belgian that lacks much rich, fruit flavor, but has the mild grapefruit bitterness instead. Nice alcohol level, a very easy beer to drink and very interesting. A little thin, but not a problem.



Not a typical Belgian Pale, but a clean an interesting change of pace. Tired of typical Belgian sweetness and fruit? - This would be a nice way to go."
Sea Dog Brewing Company,Sea Dog Blue Paw Wheat Ale,,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,4.60%,bottle,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,6/11/2006,"Pretty much as you would expect.



Very clear golden color with no head or lacing. Smell and tastes are a mild, artificial blueberry taste with little else except a slight bitterness in the finish. Not much taste or character. 



Refreshing on a very hot summer day, but outside of that, little to recommend it."
Daleside Brewery,Ripon Jewel Ale,,,English Strong Ale,5.80%,bottle,4.48,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,6/10/2006,"Typical and delicious.



Amber orange pour with an initially large head, but this fades quickly. Some spotty head is left behind with a little lacing, but not much. 



Aroma and tastes are exactly as expected. All sweet, biscuity malts with the only hint of hop character being in the short finish. Rounded and balanced and super smooth.



Now pacakaged in a brown 500 mL bottle rather than the clear one pictured. Amazingly smooth and highly drinkable. Maybe a little too much alcohol to be considered strictly sessionable, but could be drunk in large quantities."
New Holland Brewing Company,New Holland Blue Goat,,,Doppelbock,?,bottle,2.95,3,3,3,2.5,3,6/10/2006,"Thanks to Beerinator for the opportunity to try this as part of XBIF 39.



In the end this was a somewhat disappointing Doppelbock. All the important charcteristics were there, but it left me feeling unsatisfied.



Good looking dark mahogany pour, but the beer was a bit lifeless. Not much in the way of lasting head and no lacing. Good malt aromas, but too much alcohol in the taste and in the smell for me. The body lacked the substance that a big Doppelbock should posess, and was simply too thin.



Final alcohol burn in the finish completed the somewhat less than stellar effort."
SweetWater Brewing Company,Sweetwater Dubbel D's,,,Dubbel,8.60%,on-tap,4.15,5,4,4,4,4.5,6/10/2006,"On-tap, Taco Mac, Decatur, GA. Small tulip serving.



If this truly is a Dubbel it's the best looking one that I have seen ever! It was a mid-brown, with a small head and most delightfully, it was crystal clear. It lacked the nasty, murky dishwater appearance of so many Dubbel's. Now, I guess that may be negative points in some purists eyes when we consider the style, but I was delighted with the look - it's DEFINITELY exceptional FOR THE STYLE, hence the 5.0.



Aroma and tastes are all there in true Belgian fashion, with the yeast and spice notes coupling with the alcohol to produce a super smooth experience. I was surprised at the smoothness of the beer, and the ease with which it went down.



Not a classic Dubbel by any stretch of the imagination, but a very nice start by Sweetwater to venture into a slightly different area. Nice Belgian characteristics, and if this is a sign of things to come, they can only go from strength to strength."

If I had to describe this beer in simple terms, I would describe it as an alcoholic brown ale.



Deep garnet pour with a nice initial head but this fades pretty quickly. No lacing. Very rich aroma of malty alcohol.



A little burn in the mouth and on the way down, this exhibits a touch too much alcohol for me, but the rest of the beer and style appeal to me. Delicious, full mouthfeel and a super tasty experience."

Hazed orange pour with a fluffy head and good lacing.



Grapefruit notes are immediately apparent in the nose and this manifests itself on the palate quickly too. Green hop bitterness is consistent, and does not fade, and makes this a very drinkable, session type consistent ale.



Solid representation of the American take on an IPA, with plenty of hoppiness not afraid to hide. Refreshing too, with a short and sharp bite in the finish. Clean too. As is often the case, it benefits from warming, but not too much (benefit or warming!)



A nice beer that I would fall back to when I wanted something simple and reliable."

Pretty typical of the style which has a tendency to pour initially with an attractive, frothy head, only to lose it very quickly and the beer become really rather flat in both appearance and body.



Nice cream ale taste with some drying, bitter hops - I always think of the style as a sweetened Pilsner. This is pretty representative of the style with no surprises.



Golden in the glass and decent summertime drinkability, but outside of that a very run of the mill beer on most levels. OK, but that's as far as it goes."

22oz Bomber.



Excellent mahogany red color with a super head and plenty of lacing. A real nice looker.



Aroma is sweet hops.



It's all here. Plenty of rye character from start to finish and the hops are delicious and full. A double IPA type feel, without the abrasiveness of mega-hops, and a sensible, but still satisfying 7.0% ABV.



Very full in the mouth, with plenty to contemplate as you consume it. Has the unusual effect of being thirst quenching and satisfying.



Easy drinking, with a full taste - a really pleasing beer."
Left Hand Brewing Company,Left Hand Milk Stout,,,Milk / Sweet Stout,5.20%,bottle,2.78,4,2.5,2.5,3.5,3,6/4/2006,"A lot of sweetness up front with that tell-tale lactose aroma. For me there is a VERY fine line between the attractiveness of the lactose nose & taste, and the classic Hershey's ""vomit"" taste & smell which haunts all of that company's chocolate products (try chocolate from around the world and you'll notice the Hershey ""vomit"" characteristic).



Good looking black body and I like the packaging.



Strong Hershey milk chocolate feel.



Acidic finish which enhances the lactose feel, rather unusual and nice for a change, but more than one of these and I'd be struggling."
O'Fallon Brewery,Smoke (Smoked Porter),,,American Porter,6.00%,bottle,3.2,2.5,3,3.5,3,3,6/4/2006,"Thanks go out to BigLove for the opportunity.



Dark brown, dirty and murky body with a hell of a lot of yeast(?) sediment at the bottom of the glass. Not much head and no lacing.



Very little smoke in the nose, but lots in the taste. Mocha coffee mixed with the more obvious and expected bacon and ham chewiness.



Much more smokey than a simple smoked porter to me, in fact this is really a Rauchbier in my book.



Drinkability is OK, BUT you have to real like the Rauchbier style to enjoy this."

22 oz bottle, with silk screened notes.
Pour is dark, dark garnet brown with a nice head but it is short lived. Very little lacing to speak of and only a small film of fine tan bubbles are left behind.
Sweet vanilla notes in the nose with some lactose sweetness too.
The mouthfeel is thin for a 9.00 ABV beer, but this is not really a problem as the tastes hold it up well.
Tastes have a lactose sweetness and a biscuit malt. There is a definite port/vanilla taste that fades quickly to a sweet finish. Quite dry in the end with some definite alcohol coming through. On warming more very mild coffee, vanilla and alcohol notes come through. Richer.
Interesting, and I enjoyed it, but the lack of bitterness and hop character will not be to everyone's liking."
"Cervecería Centro Americana, S.A.",Famosa (Gallo),,,American Adjunct Lager,5.00%,bottle,1.85,2,2,2,1.5,1.5,6/2/2006,"Very pale straw color with a complete lack of body and character.



This horribly watery beer is exactly what you'd expect. On the plus side there is no skunk and it is refreshing in the way that water is, but outside of that, no taste, no body and frankly no point.



Starts with corny sweetness and finishes with a bitter twist that is not really hop based, more like a peppery driness - you get the picture, don't bother."
"Middle Ages Brewing Co., Ltd.",Beast Bitter,,,Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB),5.30%,bottle,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5/31/2006,"Pale, orange lucozade color, with a billowing ivory head.
Huge and sweet biscuit malts dominate the nose. The taste is just the same with a classic English bitter feel where the sweet malts dominate around the low ABV and the mild hop presence. Mouthfeel is silky smooth and perfect for the style.
The finish allows the mandatory hops to cut in, to give a satisfyingly bitter and lingering end. A very, very nicely put together package. My only criticism is a slightly too dry an ending. It is a little too puckering for me. Apart from that, a great little package.
I would imagine that when this is ultra-fresh it is unbelievable. My sample was not especially fresh, but it was still a cracking beer."

Lovely black coffee appearance with a lingering spotty head and some lacing. Body has a cola or black coffee color.



Alcohol is quite strong in the nose and is really rather apparent in the aftertaste too. Burned malts are there as well, but there is a fairly bitter taste that is very noticeable.



I prefer a creamier Porter, with a bit less harsh bitterness but that is just personal preference and this is still a solid example."

Pours exactly as a standard adjunct lager would, with a typical golden color. However, the head lasts a little longer than similar beers, and there was a little lacing.



Aroma has definite corn character, even though the label claims ""only the finest hops, spring barley and pure Jamaican water...(are used)""



Very sweet taste, and for me it comes across as pretty much an adjunct (at least in terms of the look and the taste). Some dry alcoholic hops in the finish, but very, very little.

Well, if this isn't dry, farmhouse scrumpy cider without the apple taste I don't know what is.
All the characteristics are there - dry and puckering aftertaste with a sour lip-smacking effect on the mouth.
Not my favorite drink by some distance, and I am at a bit of a loss to see why the Gueuze style gains so many plaudits when compared to real, dry authentic farmhouse cider."

Good clarity on the pour, but a really thin looking body. Weak head that quickly becomes nothing within seconds of pouring. Malty certainly, with a decent amber color but the body and subsequent mouthfeel are less than average. 



Apparently brewed with German Perle and Tettnang hops which give it a bit of a dry Pils aftertaste.



Not bad, but a bit of an odd mix of styles and tastes. Like Travis said, certainly not a Scottish Ale in my book. Not great, but OK."

Brown pour with a distinct initial cherry aroma. The cherries continue into the first sips, but these are replaced quickly by the chocolate. The combination gives the finish a chocolate covered cherry taste - a bit sickly sweet and not what I want in my beer.



The really odd thing here is the mouthfeel. There is a dinstict powdery feel to it, not at all to my liking or conducive to drinking.



I dunno, a novelty certainly and it may appeal to some, but for me this is a definite ""miss""."

Pale orange. Small head with little or no lacing.

Thanks go out to Vancer. STILL working my way through his delivery from the Old Farts/CEO BIF. New label on the bottle compared to the BA db picture.
Much the same as my original review except the fact i did not find this quite as drinkable.
Original Review - May 2006
===
Firstly thanks go out to Travis (BA BigLove) for the bottle with no label.
Classic, hazed orange IPA body with a spectacular head and some very nice lacing. Appearance smacks of quality.
Plenty of citrus pine hops in the nose.
Balance is the key word here. Lots of IPA pine hop character, but the solid pale malts make those hops underwhelming. I bet that I like this much more than many American BA's who have been bombarded with hop bomb after hop bomb in this category.
Very English in its character with an understated hop presence and a super biscuit malt balance. Taste is reserved, which will not suit some, but for me it is refreshing, light and a great change in pace. Perfect balance in the finish too, with sweet and dry competing in a delicate dance.
Drinkability is off the charts. Very, very subtle and has quality written all over it."
Stone Brewing Co.,Stone 05.05.05 Vertical Epic Ale,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,8.50%,bottle,4.2,4,5,4,4,4,5/27/2006,"Poured into the Duvel tulip.



One half inch, dense pock marked head sits atop the dark brown, almost Dubbel like body. Color is not the most attractive. The head fades but leaves that tell-tale spotty and creamy deposit for the remainder of the beer - a sure sign of a quality product.



Rich nose with the classic figs, prunes, dark sugar and raisin notes. Excellent.



Taste has all the characteristics of a Belgian dark, but has an added bitterness. The bitterness lingers a little too long for me, and takes the edge off the beer. I would befinitely prefer a mellower experience.



Some alcohol notes are prominent, but despite this the beer drinks easily, if somewhat of a sipper.



Definitely some burned hoppiness in there, which for me is a little out of place."
Brasserie Theillier,La Bavaisienne,,,Bière de Garde,7.00%,bottle,3.18,1,4,3.5,2.5,2.5,5/26/2006,"A collosal (and I mean huge) snowstorm effect on pouring, with what appears NOT to be yeast sediment, rather something that looks like coagulated proteins. Looks DIRE. Perhaps a bad bottle, but difficult to tell. This is certainly an old bottle, but this should age with no problems so perhaps it was not kept well. Anyway, without any date on the bottle I feel justified in reviewing it anyway.



Nice head, but the body is disgusting looking. Very mild, English bitter type aromas with a definite lack of farmhouse funk. Mellow biscuit tates, with a small amount of caramel too.



Difficult to comment on other things with so much crap floating around, so I will add more to this review when I am lucky enough to get hold of another bottle."

Deep and rich flavors with a great body and a tasty finish make this super-drinkable. Sweet, but a little bit of hop balance helps it a great deal.
Lovely deep brown, rich pour with a nice head and some decent retention and lacing. romas are rich and coffee based.
Coffee, toffee, caramel and deep malts abound to make this a very satisfying and tasty beer."
Shipyard Brewing Co.,Pumpkinhead Ale,,,Pumpkin Ale,5.10%,bottle,3.85,3,4,4,3,4,5/25/2006,"Very clear and orange in the pour with some decent carbonation. Looks nice.



Aroma is very tempting with obvious cinnamon and spice notes. This is carried into the taste. Very, very refreshing to drink and I really enjoyed its tangy, tastiness. The ironic thing is that it is so refreshing it is suited to being a spring or summer brew.



Clean and satisfying in the mouth and in the finish.



I really enjoyed this and I am surprised at some of the low scores."
ReaperAle,Redemption Red Ale,,,American Amber / Red Ale,6.60%,bottle,1.65,2.5,2.5,1.5,1.5,1,5/24/2006,"A nasty experience which certainly poses the question, ""Did I get a bad bottle?"" Well, there's no way of knowing, but since I bought this from a reputable shop and there is no Best Before date on the bottle, I feel completely justified (with the aforementioned note) in writing this review.



Colossal carbonation leads to massive and annoying head, but ultimately no lacing. Reddish body, clear.



Very thin, very acidic, no body and a nasty bitter-sweet finish that is reminiscent of some kind of carbonated, artificial soft drink. Nasty stuff."
Thomas Creek Brewery,Stillwater Vanilla Cream Ale,,,Cream Ale,4.50%,bottle,2.68,4,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,5/24/2006,"Very yellow (almost artificial looking) color, but with a really nice head and some attractive lacing. Cloudy appearance, a bit like an artificial Hefe.



Definite Cream Ale feel, quite nice in the mouth, and considering the vanilla moniker virtually no vanilla flavor for me.



Has a distinct Wit feel, but without the spice notes.



Not a very good beer, but a little better than I expected. Drinkable as lawnmower material but little else."
Brouwerij Lindemans,Lindemans Gueuze Cuvée René,,,Gueuze,5.00%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,5/22/2006,"If you want to know what traditional, real farmhouse cider from the West of England tastes like, the closest you can get in the USA is this stuff. If you were to remove the carbonation and add a hint of apple flavor to a Cuvee Rene, you would have yourself a pretty decent impression of a dry, farmhouse scrumpy.



Champagne like, effervescent pour with a fast receding head. Dry, and mildly acidic and sour. Clear yellow pour.



A departure for most beer drinkers, but a nice refreshing summer drink. Keep it to a very occasional treat, and use it to broaden horizons. Although certainly a little drier than usual, a party aperitif perhaps?"

Deep brown with a large head initially, but this soon fades to leave very little head or laing.



Aroma is deep alcohol and burned and roasted malts.



The roasted bitterness was surprising to me. I expected much greater smoothness. Alcohol is a bit strong too. Not as mellow as I usually like my Doppelbocks to be.



Strangely, desite the lack of smoothness it is still very drinkable.. Roasted malts, chocolate and smoky undertones. Quite complex."

Very ordinary.



Light brown pour with a good head. The nose and tastes are mild caramel with a dry character cutting across the initial malt sweetness and the later bitterness. Finish dry and bitter. The dry character was quite pronounced I thought.



Not much to report here, reminiscent of a very average English keg bitter. Drinkable, but also pretty forgettable."
Summit Brewing Company,Summit Extra Pale Ale,,,English Pale Ale,5.30%,bottle,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,5/17/2006,"Very straightforward decent quality brew. Some good carbonation on the pour with an attractive, but lighter than expected amber color with a little chill haze. Enjoyable malt backdrop with a fairly dry, hop taste cutting across the malts in the mouth and in the finish.



A little citrus in there too, and the beer is a decent thirst quencher. Nothing special, but a nice steady, solid performer. Not a style that I can ever get very excited about, but this is a decent tasting beer.



Thanks to feloniousmonk for the chance to try this one."
Mendocino Brewing Company,Black Hawk Stout,,,American Stout,5.20%,bottle,3.8,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,5/16/2006,"To me this a much more traditional stout than many of the more modern representations out there. A black pour with hints of brown too, there is a distinct smoky aroma present. Good head and nice lacing.



Tastes are on the dry side of things with some burnt malt character and a really good astringent hop bite. Not ""hoppy"" hops as such, but dry and bitter - the kind of stout my Dad would have enjoyed drinking.



Dry and short finish, this is an old-time stout where double this and uber that have been put to one side to remind us of what a traditional stout should taste like, that is a beer in a style close to its origins."
Smuttynose Brewing Company,Smuttynose S'muttonator (Big Beer Series),,,Doppelbock,8.50%,bottle,4.28,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,5/16/2006,"Super, slightly viscous red/brown pour with a small head and some sticky lacing.
A threatening toffee alcohol nose that sets the table for the tastes.
Big and bold up front, with caramel, toffee and sugary sweetness dominating. However, there is a modicum of ""extra"" experience in there with alcohol being prominent (but still under control - just) and some spice character. I get some ginger too.
Finishes sweet, long and strong.
Lovely example of the style, slightly atypical with the spice notes, but I thought it was interesting and it still managed to pull it off nicely. Drinkability is good, but I would stop at the 22 oz in front of me."
Wolnzacher Bürgerbraü AG,Wolnzacher Nikolausbier,,,Munich Dunkel Lager,5.50%,bottle,2.73,2,3,2.5,3,3,5/16/2006,"Dark brown pour with plenty of deep red hues. Initial, highly carbonated fizz creates a sizeable head but it disappears very quickly. No lacing to speak of. Very quickly takes on a drab, flat appearance.



Sweet malts are all I get in the nose. 



The beer is OK, but it has an odd watery finish that I don't really understand. It has the potential to be a really meaty, malt monster, but it falls well short of that. Very slight port like aftertaste, but it is weak.



I have my doubts about the freshness of this bottle, but at the same time with no best before date it's impossible to tell."

Sweet malts dominate initially, but this is followed quickly by some fruity bitterness. The fruity hops linger in a longer than usual finish and aftertaste. Some metallic aftertastes that were not unpleasant. A crisp, bright, clean feel about the beer.



Nice for a pedestrian style, but it is drinkable and a nice, if simple example."
Highland Brewing,Highland Gaelic Ale,,,American Amber / Red Ale,5.80%,bottle,3.4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,5/13/2006,"One of the better examples of a style that I usually find rather uninteresting. The key here is a malt sweetness and a hop edge in balance. It's a pretty simple beer, but the gentle combination makes it a drinkable, if somewhat unspectacular brew.



Good, dark copper color with some head and lacing. Mild carbonation. An above average mouthfeel.



The simple combination gives a pleasing beer that is simple and easy to drink. Nothing really outstanding here, but a decent beer."

Aroma is simple toasted malts, and the taste is a classic (if somewhat dry) British ESB. Caramel malts with a bigger than expected hop finish. Slight sftertaste of hard water and a definite dry feeling.



A decent brew but for me it lacks the smoothness that it should display.



In summary, a good brew but frankly it has the potential to be even better. Fell slightly short for me."
Thomas Creek Brewery,Deep Water Dopplebock,,,Doppelbock,6.30%,bottle,1.6,3.5,2,1.5,1.5,1,5/13/2006,"Not good.



Thomas Creek have been in GA for sometime now, and I have only got around to trying this one now. Not a very nice experience at all.



Pour is decent looking with a brown body and decent head that leaves some lacing. The aroma seems to be stout like, but is also acidic. There is a thought of chocolate malt in there somewhere too.



The acid feeling is taken into the taste. The body is woefully thin for a beer of this style and the whole experience is insipidly acid like. This doesn't seem to be a very well crafted beer at all.



Nearly a drain pour so drinkability is a 1.0. Very cheesy artwork caps a near, total write-off for me."
Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),Samuel Adams Brown Ale,,,English Brown Ale,5.40%,bottle,4.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,5/12/2006,"The beauty here is the simplicity.



Very easy drinking with a full flavor but not huge. Definitely a complex, layered malt backbone, biscuity and then a lovely hop finish.



Mouthfeel is really full, and thirst quenching.



Simply put, a simply built beer that satisfies and is very flavorful to boot. The subtlety is as refreshing as the beer."
Meantime Brewing Company Limited,London Porter,,,English Porter,6.50%,bottle,3.83,2.5,3.5,4,4,4,5/11/2006,"Nice, heavy duty 750 mL bottle with classy looking labels.



Murky brown appearance, not especially attractive (it has that nasty Dubbel color) with some ruby red highlights. The ""look"" is definitely the weakest point.



A lot more alcohol in the nose than appears in the taste.



Very chocolatey indeed. Decent mouthfeel but it does lack a creamy component.



Authentic is an adjective that springs to mind."

Light amber color, with no significant head or lacing.



Good balance, quite dry and a nice bitter twang in the finish and the aftertaste.



The label mentions something about a ""light brown ale"", but this is definitely not that in either color or style.



Good brewery, but only a slightly above average beer."

Thanks to Hoppymeal for the trade. Summer version.
More of the typical West Coast DIPA appearance with a huge rocky head and massive, sticky lace - exactly as expected. Still typical, with large resinous hops, big alcohol and tenuously held together with the malts.
Original Review (05/09/06)

Thanks to Tom (warriorsoul) for the trade. Winter version.
Mid-orange pour with a nice head and some serious, sticky lacing. Some good carbonation.
Very solid, highly hopped DIPA - obviously; but not so obviously a rather viscous mouthfeel. The combination of the viscosity and the hops make this drink rather too much like an American Barleywine for my own tastes, but that's just me.
Plenty of hops in the nose, but I also get some tea. 
The taste is really quite sweet. Lots of smoothness too, and still some of that tea residual flavor hanging around. Finishes with a light citrus touch - very mild grapefruit.
Quite heavy on the sweetness and as a result in lacks the punch, clean feel and snap of a DIPA for me, so overall not my favorite. Better than average? Certainly. One of the very best? Not in my book."

If there was any doubt about this not being the same beer as Shower, just take a look at that distinctive Golden Color! Really deep. Now in four packs of 12 oz bottles. Got mine for $7.49 at Mac's, I suspect this was priced incorrectly (should be closer to $11.49).
Original Review (Golden Shower)

More excellent stuff from DFH. 750 mL bottled on 03/21/06. Cheers to Tom (warriorsoul) for another great trade.
Great looking pour with a darker than expected, real gold color - not really ""Golden"", but literally Gold color. Very nice carbonation and a relatively aggressive pour gives a big head and good lacing.
Definite viscous feel to the beer in the mouth (as expected) it feels luxurious. Light syrup sweetness with the hoppy finish.
I really like the rich feel to this style. It really feels like you are experiencing something out of the ordinary. Reminiscent of Rogue's version of the style, but better value and a slightly more bitter, hoppy edge with the sweetness toned down a little. Still sweet, but ironically slightly more hopped than the Morimoto.
In summary, delicious, another great brewing experience from DFH, and a ""push the envelope"" style that is a big hit with me."
Flying Dog Brewery,Dogtoberfest,,,Märzen / Oktoberfest,5.30%,bottle,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,5/4/2006,"A decent and drinkable Marzen with mid amber color and a good clarity to the pour. Not much head or lacing. 



Some bubblegum notes in the nose. Nice malty beer that serves a very simple purpose. Simple fare and average tastes, but you could do much worse.



Mouthfeel is not big, but satisfies.



Don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed."
Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery,Masala Mama India Pale Ale,,,American IPA,5.90%,growler,3.33,4.5,4,3,3.5,3,5/4/2006,"Thanks go out to feloniousmonk for the 64 oz growler.
Mid-orange pour with an attractive head that fades a little but with better than average lacing. 
Initial tastes are very fruity - peachy, bubble gum, light floral notes, but this gives way to a quick double take. This first blow is a massive hop follow-up - well, fair enough I was expecting that, but then we get the finish and the aftertaste. It's all aspirin and it takes control of almost everything else. The aftertste lingers a long time and begins to grate a bit.
This is obviously a good brew, but the aspirin effect makes this really rather unbalanced."

http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/321/27804/?ba=Ding
This weekend it was Urthel-Hop It.
I figured that there would be at least a few valid comparisons, and I think that there were. Both Belgian yeast based with typical Belgian aromas and characteristics, and both exhibiting an unusual addition of lots of hops. For my money the Urthel managed to pull it off nicely, whereas the Chouffe was all a bit of a mess.
This poured with a more modest head than the Chouffe and with less yellow color. This was much more orange and was more reserved to look at. Still excellent lacing and a nice persistent foamy head.
Aroma gave away the Belgian character with layered sugary yeast smells, but also the delicate hops. 
Tastes were dry, but refreshing. Lovely hop twang and an unusual bitterness against the sweet back drop. Much more reserved and subtle than the Chouffe and generally much more together.
Pretty good drinkability, I really enjoyed the one glass that I drank."

Sweet malty nose. 



Nice mild and creamy aftertaste, with sweetness and plenty to recommend it. Some caramel, some nuttiness and some molasses.



I'll definitely drink this again."
Coopers Brewery Limited,Coopers Dark Ale,,,English Dark Mild Ale,4.50%,bottle,2.58,2,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,4/29/2006,"Without the bottle sediment this pours very much like a decent looking Brown Ale without the red highlights - when the sediment is added it takes on a somewhat unattractive, typical Dubbel appearance. The sediment is very chalky looking.



Aroma? Well I get almost nothing (except the obvious ""beer"" and a little alcohol)



Well I'm not sure if this is much like an English Mild, it really drinks more like a low quality Brown Ale, and not a very tasty one at that.



Yeasty and dry in the mouth, thin too."
Abita Brewing Co.,Fleur-de-lis Restoration Ale,,,American Blonde Ale,?,bottle,3.73,3,4,3.5,4,4,4/28/2006,"Not my favorite style, but the more I drink this type of beer, the more it grows on me. It seems to improve down each glass too.



Very much a golden color with some initial head, but the head and lacing are gone soon.



A lot of freshly mown hay and grass in the nose, and this is reflected in the taste. Soft and rounded in the mouth with easy drinking written all over it. Light and creamy, this has obvious summer session potential



A little reminder of a Pilsner in the finish."

Typical red-brown, Coke like appearance with a decent head and a little lacing.



Chocolate malt overtones are big, as is the mouthfeel - surprisingly so for the style I thought.



Nicely smoothed out, with a little extra dry character that I was not expecting. Easy drinking indeed, very nice example. It feels authentic to me."

Had a typical Dubbel type appearance. I always think this is a disappointing look to a beer - all drab, murky, muddy brown in the glass, not especially appetizing. Some very thin head and minimal lacing.
Soft sugary taste with an acidic twang too. Caramel tastes, but it fails to impress. Quite thin I thought. Very average all around, not something I'm likely to bother with again anytime soon.
Not sure about the Oktoberfest moniker here either, a bit more Dunkel than that."
Brasserie d'Achouffe,Houblon Chouffe Dobbelen IPA Tripel,,,Belgian IPA,9.00%,bottle,3.23,5,3,3.5,3,2.5,4/23/2006,"OK, here we go with this unique marriage of styles.



Appearance is a straight 5. No doubt. Attractive, hazed orange body topped with a massive foamy and rocky head. The head subsides slowly to leave what looks like beaten egg whites, dense, creamy and pillow-like and the lacing is some of the best I can recall EVER seeing!



Aroma is typically Belgian with the spice and yeast overtones coming through strong. Surprisingly a distinct lack of hops in the nose.



Well, it's certainly hoppy in a way that Belgian beers are not, and in that respect it is very reminiscent of a De Ranke XX. An amazing amount of grapefruit citrus tastes, but surprisingly not hop tasting. The Tripel undertone is constant, and as the beer warms the sweetness begins to come through. At this stage the grapefruit bitterness is only really present in the sharp and short finish.



Mouthfeel is a bit soapy and to be honest the whole thing sits a bit awkwardly.



For me this ends up being a little bit caught in no-mans land. An odd marriage of competing styles, that while definitely interesting, fails to pull it off. It ended up tasting a bit like a tripel with some artificial bitterness added. All rather odd and the drinkability really suffers as a result."

Poured into the Brasserie des Rocs chalice, it forms a one inch head before receding to leave an espresso film and some very nice, very fine lacing. Black opaque.



Big chocolate nose.



Very mild tastes, not at all bitter. Large, creamy mouthfeel with the dominant taste being a very mild licorice. This imparts a dry finish.



Very nice, a small tasting stout considering the 8.00% ABV, and the alcohol is well hidden. Drinkable."
Heineken Nederland B.V.,Heineken Premium Light Lager,,,Light Lager,3.30%,bottle,1.6,1.5,1.5,1.5,1.5,2,4/22/2006,"Quite what the point of this is (at least from a beer point of view) is utterly lost on me. Obviously purely a marketing ploy. 
All in all, very much like Heineken except watered down.
Extremely thin in the mouth and taste but still manages to stamp the trademark ""skunk"" smell and taste. I have come to the conclusion that this is not really skunk as such, despite all the paranoia about green bottles etc., it's simply the way Heineken tastes and smells - Skunky!
On the grand scale, relatively unoffensive which I suppose is something, but also tasteless.

Meantime Brewing Company Limited,India Pale Ale,,,English India Pale Ale (IPA),7.50%,bottle,4.68,4.5,4,5,4,5,4/22/2006,"OK, I'm slightly confused. I know that this was originally only released in the USA since the brewer thought that the best place for a large IPA to be appreciated would be on this side of the pond. The logic presumably being that a big hop bomb would be a little too much for contemporary English taste buds - OK, fair enough, it all makes sense so far, but when I taste this, that logic goes out of the window. 
Don't get me wrong, I love this beer, but because it was initially reserved for the ""hop loving"" American market I was expecting a West Coast style punch in the face. Instead I got what I know and love to be the English IPA style; subtle, loving, Fuggles and Goldings, and I could almost be in Kent! If my compatriots at home have abandoned drinking this kind of beer the end is nigh! Anyway, back to the drink. Cloudy amber, great head and lacing and big blunt, butter hop aroma in the style of a great English cask. Carbonation is low (after the initial mild bottle fizz) and it sits there looking majestic.
Low bitterness with plenty of malt, but the key here is/are the subtle tones. I'd be surprised if this appealed to the folks familiar with American IPA's, but I would be equally surprised if the English BA's thought this was too hoppy for their liking. Drinkability is beyond the scale and I love it."

Dark, murky brown looking a lot like a darkish Dubbel. Smallish head, but very, very fine carbonation make up the head and the lace. The lace is liquid rather than sticky, but still attractive.



Alcoholic bananas, some fruit and a little port in the nose.



Typically Belgian in the mouth with a very full experience, rolling and rounded fruits all brought together with mild acidity, big yeasts, alcohol and fine carbonation.



High drinkability, with a dry finish, another very, very solid interpretation from this classy brewer."
Mendocino Brewing Company,Black Eye Ale,,,Black & Tan,6.50%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,4/20/2006,"Surprisingly enjoyable. I am definitely not a fan of Black & Tan's, or indeed blended beers in general, but this was very nice.



Very dark pour with a small head and some lacing. This nothing if not extremely malty. A lot of creaminess and a very sweet and tasty experience. Reminded me of a creamy Porter - something like St. Peter's, or even like a creamy Brown Ale. Some very, very mild bitterness in the finish, but very little - a creamy, weak coffee.



22 oz bomber @ $2.99 represents very good value."
Avery Brewing Company,White Rascal,,,Witbier,5.60%,bottle,3.93,2.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,4/17/2006,"Extreme yellow color, almost to the point of looking artificial. Cloudiness yes, but with the addition of rather a lot of yeast type floaties. Not adding to the aesthetic nature of the beer.



Decent head, some lacing.



Typical in many respects. Highly drinkable with an orange peel and coriander back drop. Goes down real easy - need hot weather to fully enjoy one of these.



Mouthfeel is better than average, a decent interpretation."
Tommyknocker Brewery,Jack Whacker Wheat Ale,,,American Pale Wheat Ale,5.40%,bottle,3.58,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4/17/2006,"Not bad. Straddles an interesting divide between wheat and fruit beer. This is strictly a hot weather beer. It is amazingly drinkable - as long as you have a thirst. Without a thirst it's a pretty bland and non-descript.



Cloudy, chill-hazed pour, with a butterscotch/orange color. Decent head and some lacing. Aroma has the big lemon grass hit and this doesn't let up much. It's pretty floral. I'd imagine it could put some people off.



Mild acidity and a very clean taste. Mouthfeel is light, but it matches the tastes.



Not a beer that you would want in any other condition other than highly chilled, and not a beer that you would want to be drinking outside of the context of a really hot day. However, if you appreciate it for what it is, and don't expect too much you may enjoy it. If you are looking for anything other than a beer to chug on a sweltering day I suspect that you may be disappointed."

Sweet, ester based aroma with fruit in there, but not distinguishable as anything specific.



Metallic bitterness and a sharp finish - all a bit odd. Comes together in a sort of spiced hoppiness. Warming on the way down.



A tiny bit of apricot in the aftertsate, but very little.



I don't think I'd want to drink more than one of these at a sitting, it's a little off the beaten path. Worth a try at least once."

Opaque black - jet black with a fast receding, coffee colored, fine bubbled head. Some lacing but not very extensive. Motor oil is a good descriptor.
Aroma is dark, burned sugar with lots of alcohol.
Amazingly dense - the glass feels ultra-heavy.
Each mouthful burns with bitterness as it enters the mouth, but like the head, it receded quite quickly to leave a rich, fully coating, dark creaminess. Seriously big, this is a massive drink. Roasted and burned notes are all over the place."
"St. George Brewing Company, The",American Brown Ale,,,American Brown Ale,5.50%,bottle,3.08,3.5,3,3,2.5,3.5,4/15/2006,"From the mixed Dragon Pack.



A surprisingly thick head forms with some lacing. The head is a light brown color, cappuccino like, that sits on top of the deep brown body.



Nicely balanced, with a decent bitter bite complemented by the malts, this drinks easily. Some dry acidity too that I would have expected to take away from the beer, but somehow it all seems to stay together rather well. Having said all of that, a little too thin overall for my taste.



Aftertaste is a little odd as well, with almost a dry, stout-like bitterness coming through.



Not bad, although I like my brown ales with a little more sweetness and some more body. Definitely not my favorite brown, but some redeeming features."
Brouwerij der St. Benedictusabdij de Achelse,Trappist Achel 8° Blond,,,Tripel,8.00%,bottle,4.48,5,4.5,4.5,5,4,4/14/2006,"Poured into the Val-Dieu chalice it presents itself as a very pale golden color. The head is big and lacks a real rocky appearance (rather ultra-fine bubbles predominate), but the slightly thinner nature means the best lacing I have seen for a very long time forms on the glass - I'm giving it a 5.0 for appearance PURELY based on the lace.



Aroma is mild yeast with some lemony/citrus hops.



Mild sweetness in the taste, typically Belgian Tripel notes, but not nearly as sweet as many of the style. A definite champagne like dry finish too - if I had to choose one word I would say it was delicate.



Not huge in the mouth, but the fine bubbles make for a great velvet smooth experience.



Quite dry and plenty of alcohol in the taste and the finish so the drinkability is not enormous, but this exudes class all over. Nice example of a Belgian to give as a crossover to the uninitiated."
Avery Brewing Company,Old Jubilation,,,Winter Warmer,8.30%,bottle,4.25,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4/12/2006,"Great tawny brown, deep colored pour with a big head, nice lacing and some decent retention.



Aroma is alcoholic and acidic fruit.



Tastes are dark fruits (figs, plums, raisins) but there is a strong brandy alcohol presence too. Definite huge malts up front, but this fades very rapidly in the finish to give some real bitterness. A very complete and quite complex beer indeed.



Mouthfeel is full and staisfying. Quite alcoholic in the taste, but not in an overpowering way."
Scottish & Newcastle UK Ltd.,McEwan's Scotch Ale,,,Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy,8.00%,bottle,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4/12/2006,"Thanks to BigLove for this as part of BCG BIF.



Wow! Incredibly surprised and delighted by this. I was expecting a fairly bland beer from what I usually consider to be a pedestrian brewery, but instead I got a full-on taste assault, and delicious experience.



Deep garnet pour, decent head and retention and some nice lacing too. Put it all together, and it's a really nice looker.



Sugary, malt molasses and burnt caramel are present in the nose and this is almost exactly replicated in the taste. The aftertaste is delicious, with a warming sweet alcohol. Mouthfeel is rich and smooth.



I was amazed at the richness and taste of this beer. A massive (and pleasant) surprise."
Brouwerij Westvleteren (Sint-Sixtusabdij van Westvleteren),Trappist Westvleteren 8,,,Dubbel,8.00%,bottle,4.38,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4/11/2006,"Firstly, I owe BA SilentSabre a huge debt following his trauma in getting this to me. For those that didn't read his posting on this, essentially he had a case of this shipped to him directly from Belgium only to find the whole case, bar two bottles, had been smashed in transit. Prior to that nightmarish event, he had promised me one of the Westy's, and despite the fact he only got to try one bottle for himself from the shipment, he still had the good grace to stick to his word and pass one of the survivors on to me - thanks man!



Anyway back to the beer. Pours exactly as you would expect a Dubbel to. Cloudy, dirty brown appearance, some floaties, but with a better than average head - frothy coffee type appearance, almost cappuccino in appearance.



Aroma is all fruit, especially bananas, and to be honest it had the whiff of what I would call a luxurious Hefe! The luxury is continued in the mouthfeel, very silky and smooth especially considering the style of beer we are dealing with here.



On to the taste - very typically Belgian Dubbel with two notable exceptions. Firstly there was a definite added complexity, but the real surprise to me was the finish and the aftertaste. It was really quite dry, alcoholic and a very pronounced bitterness. It very strongly reminded me of a 1970's Guinness.



Overall a very, very nice beer, but it would have to do an awful in order to live up to the massive hype. It pulls it off, but just!"

Massive rocky headed pour, and the head is very airy and falls away quickly. Leaves little or no lacing and a tiny residue on the surface of the beer. Typical deep mahogany color with the expected cloudiness. 



Sweet malts dominate in the full mouthfeel. The finish is surprisingly alcoholic.



Very nice example of the style, definitely worth a try."
Three Floyds Brewing Co. / Brewery & Pub,Dreadnaught IPA,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,9.50%,bottle,3.25,4,2.5,4,2.5,2.5,4/9/2006,"Thanks to BigLove for the chance to try this as part of BCG BIF.



Well, the problem here is that the reputation goes before it. Here's my take.



Lovely deep orange color, small head and some lacing but not quite as good as I was expecting, nor as I had been led to believe. 



Aroma is very, very heavy on the floral hops - it's almost like a bathroom cleaner - it teeters on the edge of great and very ""iffy"". I didn't like it much. 



Taste is predominantly sweet. I was surprised because I was expecting hops to dominate but by far the main event in the mouth is a cloying, syrupy sweetness. In that respect I think this fails somewhat. It's funny because I love sweet beers, but I was shocked by the dominance of the sweetness ahead of the hops in terms of the taste.



Slight burn on the way down, and, guess what? A sweetness in the aftertaste!



Drinkability is not great. Not bad, but I fail to see this brew as a stunning beer."
Brasserie Grain d' Orge (Brasserie Jeanne d'Arc SA),Belzebuth,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,11.80%,bottle,3.85,4,3,4,3.5,4.5,4/8/2006,"Pale orange pour with a little chill haze and some very lively carbonation.
Well, this is what it is - not much more, not much less. A massive sweet, malt bomb, very high alcohol.
Nothing much more than alcohol in the nose, but, if like me you are a fan of sweet beers, then this is very drinkable (considering the style) and a decent late night sipper. I can see how many people will not like this at all - it certainly fills a certain niche - but for those that are partial to this type of beer and the style I think you'll enjoy it.
Manages to avoid a nasty cloying sweetness (just), and despite the very high alcohol it is fairly clean.
Definitely not for everyone, but I enjoyed it."
Rogue Brewery (Brewer's on the Bay),Chipotle Ale,,,Chile Beer,5.50%,bottle,4.2,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4/8/2006,"Light amber color with an attractive ring of very light brown head.



Not much in the nose, maybe a little light smoke.



This is a very unusual beer. Some really nice bitterness with a solid malt backbone too, there are two prominent features. Some very mild smoke, and the unique heat. Both of them build over the drink, and surprisingly this really does drink like spicy food. The heat never threatens the beer, and it is very tasty. Like a spiced IPA.



I was a bit dubious, but this grew on me quickly."
The Matt Brewing Company,Saranac Chocolate Amber Lager,,,Euro Dark Lager,5.50%,bottle,3.4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4/7/2006,"Not bad, pretty decent chocolate color with some lacing and a a thin, small head. 



Good malt base, some roasted and dark fruit with a hint of smoke and a hint of chocolate. Easy drinking with a very light bitterness. Nothing to write home about, but nonetheless a decent crack at the stle that I would not avoid.



Part of the winter mixed 12 pack."
Shmaltz Brewing Company (He'Brew),He'Brew Messiah Bold,,,American Brown Ale,5.60%,bottle,4.03,4,3.5,4.5,3,4,4/2/2006,"Interesting and I enjoyed it. 



Great deep brown garnet color, and a lovely large rocky head. The color of this beer is one of the best dark hues I have seen in sometime - very rich looking and inviting. Head fades a little too quickly though, and there is a distinct lack of lace. Despite that, the color is stunning. A small amount of persistent carbonation.



A little thin in the mouth, but there is plenty of real nutty acidity that I really enjoyed. Good dark malts dominate but there is a little bitterness in the finish too.



Nice Brown Ale, from a pretty interesting brewery. I would certainly advise checking out some more of their brews."
The Matt Brewing Company,Saranac Lager,,,American Pale Lager,4.70%,bottle,2.78,3.5,2,3,2.5,3,4/2/2006,"Average all around, with the aroma being the weakness.



Real golden yellow pour with some decent head and some lacing. Despite the All-Malt status, lots of corn and vegetables are apparent in the nose, some skunk too, not very good at all.



Tastes are bland but refreshing. Decent balance with some hops in finish against the malt backbone. Very slight lingerig bitterness in the aftertaste, but wholly uninspired.



Absolutely middle of the road if somewhat watery and light on taste. Lawnmower possibilities but that's about it."
Top of the Hill Restaurant and Brewery,Poor Richard's Ale,,,Scottish Ale,?,on-tap,3.48,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4/2/2006,"I am basing the selection of style on this document;

http://www.beertown.org/homebrewing/pdf/Poor_Richards.pdf

although that is open to very wide interpretations I feel.



Malty concoction with the emphasis on the sweet dark side of things rather than bitterness or hop character. Very drinkable with the dark sugars present in the nose.



Decent looker, with some head, but fades fast.



Interesting concept, but ultimately a pretty average beer."
Carolina Brewery,Funky Monk Ale (8.5%),,,Belgian Pale Ale,8.50%,on-tap,4.2,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,3/31/2006,"To me, definitely a very good impersonation of an Abbey Dubbel. Served in the ""Cognac"" snifter glass, there is a classic dirty brown body with a small head that disappears fast.



Good fruit, with a classic Belgian yeasty finish, this beer really feels like an authentic brew. Body is substantial.



Aroma is mildly fruity, and not as developed as the fruit in the taste.



Alcohol is prominent in the finish."
Brooklyn Brewery,Brooklyn Winter Ale (2005),,,Winter Warmer,6.00%,bottle,4.4,3.5,4,4.5,4,5,3/26/2006,"A surprisingly brown beer, that lacked the ruby red highlights that the style often has. Some head, but poor retention and almost no lace.



Obviously malt based with some spicy overtones, perhaps some ginger, nutmeg and cinnamon, but whatever spices are present they serve to provide a little bitterness and dry warmth.



Highly drinakble with a nice orange peel bitter citrus finish. Not hop based but just dark enough to suggest a hint of smoke and dark winter days. A very nice beer that is highly drinkable AND has a nice alcohol kick - a nice combo.



Not as good, or as rich as Sam Adams Old Fezzy in my opinion, but of similar quality, and like that beer, it's a shame that this is not available in sixers as a winter seasonal as opposed to only being part of the mixed 12 pack. Come on BB, what about it?"
Red Brick Brewing Company,Red Brick Summer Unfiltered Wheat,,,Hefeweizen,?,bottle,3.38,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,3/26/2006,"2006 version of the Summer Hefe from Atlanta Brewing, this time in the bottle.
Classic lemon, butterscotch colored pour into the Tucher Weizen 500 mL glass. These Hefe's look great in that glass, a real classic look. Looks like a banana!
Great rocky head, but it does lose its appearance at little too quickly. Nice lacing though kinda makes up for that.
All the standard characteristics with cloves and bananas as large as life. Very slight extra bitterness in the finish which makes it a little less smooth than some others, but still a pretty good example. Good value locally here in Atlanta, and a good enough beer to allow me to justify patronizing the local beers."
Wychwood Brewery Company Ltd,Duchy Originals Organic English Ale,,,Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB),5.00%,bottle,4.2,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,3/25/2006,"Super example of the style. Very light, amber pour with great clarity. Head is very bubbly with a little lacing. Average retention.



Aroma is typical full of sweet, biscuity malts. Repeated in the taste but with a little larger than expected, dry hop finish. Bitter and dry in the aftertaste too, which is a little surprising. Adds character.



Amazingly light and drinkable, a typically soft English Ale. Has session written all over it."
Brouwerij Van Eecke N.V.,Het Kapittel Blond,,,Belgian Pale Ale,6.50%,bottle,3.15,3,3,3,3.5,3.5,3/24/2006,"Pale orange body, a slightly yellowish tinge, with some decent carbonation and a rocky head, that is nice, but short lived. 



Aroma is subdued, but has a little Belgian yeast smell. Not much else.



Slightly syrupy mouthfeel but drinkable.



A low key sugar taste, almost like a diluted Tripel, but very little else.



A pretty flat experience all around."
Thomas Hooker Ales & Lagers,Thomas Hooker Old Marley Barleywine,,,American Barleywine,10.00%,bottle,2.95,2,3.5,3,3,2.5,3/22/2006,"2006 vintage, $6.95 at Green's, Ponce de Leon, Atlanta, GA, USA.



Nice presentation in the blue, unusual shaped bottle with the swing-top. Certainly an eye-catcher.



Pour is a disappointing, drab, murky dark brown that looks like a cross between a Dubbel and a Porter. Not at all attractive. The appearance is not helped by a somewhat flat feel that adds up to an underwhelming start.



Aroma is a milk chocolate based alcohol.



Warming, acidic hops with a strong alcohol presence. Some sharp, dry bitterness in the finish, and hot on the way down. A bit like a poor Scotch.



I dunno, it just didn't really grab me. I think this needs time to sort itself out, I'd like to re-visit this again in a couple of years, but for now I'm done."

Lots of sweet fruits dominate, but there is a definite dry and bitter lingering finish. Alcohol is mild and the mouthfeel average. A little acidic too, but the Belgian character shines through in the yeast character.



Pretty good example of the style, but I always feel that a Belgian Dark that doesn't carry a larger ABV can sometimes seems a little too lightweight - that's my overwhelming memory here too."
Brouwerij Van Eecke N.V.,Het Kapittel Prior,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,9.00%,bottle,3.45,2.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,3/18/2006,"Part of the mixed, Kapittel four pack. Attractive pale blue cap on the 330 mL bottle.



Muddy brown appearance with a very distinct Dubbel look. Head is a little too carbonated and thin for my liking, but it settles down to give a creamy and spotty film on the surface.



Aroma is a little sweet malt and some fruitiness, but it's all pretty subdued.



Tastes are round and fruity with a little Belgian dry character, but not what I would call complex by any stretch of the imagination.



Short finish with a minimal aftertaste. 



Very drinkable, but it is because it is really a very simple beer. Alcohol is very well hidden to the point of being a little disappointing.



I would classify this as a solid Belgian, but it lacks the complexity of many other similar beers."
Great Divide Brewing Company,Titan IPA,,,American IPA,7.10%,bottle,4.58,4.5,5,5,4,3.5,3/18/2006,"I like this beer chiefly because it represents the American style of IPA's so very well.



Really quite striking clarity, and a seriously light copper color. Big frothy head soon pulls back to give tons of lacing and a creamy surface.



There is a hop nose that sits between citrus and pine. This is quickly followed by an amazing marriage of hops, sweetness and metallic twang in the taste.



It has a huge bitter character without really being bitter (if that makes any sense). I guess what we are talking about is a huge hop presence that has excellent malt balance to bring it all into line.



Super beer, with, for me, a limited drinkability, but it is a classical American version of an IPA."
The Matt Brewing Company,Saranac Black Forest,,,Schwarzbier,5.50%,bottle,2.08,3.5,2,2,2,2,3/18/2006,"Not surprisingly, a very average experience to say the least. Fairly weak offering from Matt.



Lots of mild acidic notes and a distinct lack of body make up this beer. Thin mouthfeel with a mildly odd plastic taste.



Pours decent, but it is ruby red rather than black, and there is a definite lack of body.



No point in going here, don't bother."
Russian River Brewing Company,Temptation,,,American Wild Ale,7.30%,bottle,4.15,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,3/16/2006,"Slightly hazed and cloudy golden yellow, with a nice head, exceptional carbonation and some decent lacing.



The more I drink of these Wild Ales, the more and more I am reminded of classic, English scrumpy ciders. All the elements are there. A crisp, apple like sharpness, with a dry finish and a high drinkability. A light mouthfeel and a mild and refreshing taste.



Typically acidic nose, but I can't get away from a Devonshire or Somerset farmhouse cider."

This was definitely the Nut Brown, since it had ""Nut Brown"" on the label! Part of the mixed sixer, Dragon Pack.



Light brown body, small head and some lacing. Good nose with plenty of malts and some bready character.



Lots of refreshing traits, with a nice bite in the finish. High drinkability.



The finish is the most interesting aspect with a sweet, caramel dry ending that rounds the drink out nicely."
Uerige Obergärige Hausbrauerei GmbH / Zum Uerige,Uerige Doppelsticke,,,Altbier,8.50%,bottle,3.88,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,3/14/2006,"$5.99 Brawley's Beverage, Charlotte, NC, USA. 11.2 fl oz.



Definitely unique presentation.



Huge, huge malt backbone holds this together. Very sweet and malty upfront with a tiny bitter bite in the short finish. A little lingering bitterness in the short aftertaste too.



Light brown body, some lacing and a small head. Sweet plummy fruits in the aroma.



Drinks like a quality doppelbock but with the edge taken off. Nice and I enjoyed it, but pretty poor value for money."
"St. George Brewing Company, The",Pilsner,,,German Pilsener,5.00%,bottle,4.38,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,3/12/2006,"Better than average if somewhat of an unusual version of the style.



This poured in a classic Pilsener manner, but the nose and taste were much, much sweeter with a distinct lack of hop bitterness that accompanies the classic version of the style.



It was creamier and more rounded than a traditional Pils, and subsequently lacked the crisp, cleanliness that one would normally associate with the traditional German beer. As long as you were not craving a classicly stlyed beer, then this all comes together rather well and is certainly highly drinkable, and rather tasty.



Not a classic if you are concerned with Pils as a style, but despite that it was very, very nice. I enjoyed it, but don't be alarmed by the non-Pils nature of this Pils."
"St. George Brewing Company, The",Winter Stout (Russian Imperial Stout),,,Russian Imperial Stout,7.60%,bottle,4.35,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,3/12/2006,"Another really nice offering from St. George. Part of their mixed sixer, the Dragon Pack.



Not much to say about the pour, except that it qualifies as a RIS. Viscous and a small (1/8th of an inch) head forms and recedes to give a classic spotty cream finish. Has an espresso look.



Sugary, toffee caramels in the nose.



Sweetness with lovely malts and only the mearest hint of bitterness in the finish. Extremely smooth, this drinks like a much, much more expensive brew.



It IS sweeter than most others of the style, and it does lack hoppy bitterness, but for me it gives a drinkable charm and exudes quality. My guess is that some people will not like this much because it lacks bite, but for me that adds to its charm."
Left Hand Brewing Company,Left Hand Imperial Stout,,,Russian Imperial Stout,10.40%,bottle,2.6,2.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,2,3/8/2006,"Appearance lacks the deep black opaque nature that one would expect from the style, and in fact there are red and brown highlights and a rather thin mouthfeel considering the RIS moniker.



Thin spotty head, and a lack of lacing.



Very strong alcohol presence in the taste, and a real burn on the way down. Quite acidic with sharp finish and lingering aftertaste.



This is a very powerful drink, but it lacks subtlety and is very strong in the alcohol department with a lack of balance."
Old Dominion Brewing Co.,Winter Brew 2005,,,American IPA,6.80%,bottle,3.9,4,4,4,4,3.5,3/6/2006,"Bottled 11/17/05.



Pours a deep, dark orange with good clarity but a nice head and some very nice lacing.



Dry hop nose with citrus undertones.



This is a hoppy beer, but there is a real malt presence that helps balance that out. Despite that, it is still pretty bitter, with a long dry finish and a sharp grapefruit edge in the aftertaste.



Round and soft in the mouth which belies the final bite!



Definitely has the American edge to the style, with a West Coast hop feel for me. A little sharp to make it really drinkable, but apart from that very nice."
Weyerbacher Brewing Co.,Insanity,,,English Barleywine,11.10%,bottle,3.23,3,3.5,3.5,3,2.5,3/6/2006,"Typical viscous looking, mid-orange appearance with no head or lacing.



Alcohol and some bananas & (of all things) coconut in the aroma.



Taste is pretty powerful. Alcohol, hop bitterness and a dry feeling combine in a not all that subtle a manner. The coconut comes back in the finish too. Very odd. Also very obvious burning on the way down.



This is a big, big beer and it's really not all that drinkable in my eyes, but many will enjoy it. Alcohol is not well hidden (not that I suppose that is something the brewer cares about) and it has an edge.



A sipper in every sense of the word."
Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),Samuel Adams Chocolate Bock,,,Bock,5.80%,bottle,3.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,3/5/2006,"Deep garnet pour with plenty of brown and red/brown highlights at the extremities. Nice tan head, good size and some lacing. A little repeated agitation starts to reveal more head with some good carbonation. Reminiscent of a quality brown ale.
A very mild burnt and smoky feature in the nose as well as a tiny bit of chocolate, but it's not strong.
Taste has a very slightly acidic chocolate essence character. Definitely an artificial taste, but at the same time not unpleasant. Again, a small acid feel in the finish that is short with a tiny but of bitterness. A bittersweet ending.
Smooth and creamy in the mouth and very drinkable.
Nice, drinkable and worth a try, but at $14-$15 a bottle simply not very good value."

Massive strawberry nose. Is this good or bad??



It's very, very sweet with an alco-pop taste, but a sufficiently tart finish to make you take notice.



Beer? Well, it is so strawberry infused that it is difficult to tell. I guess women will love it, blokes won't. Very sweet but I suppose it has a novelty factor. Certainly you could open peoples eyes by telling them that this is beer, but it's very atypical."
The Matt Brewing Company,Saranac Caramel Porter,,,American Porter,5.40%,bottle,3.53,4,4,3.5,2.5,3.5,3/1/2006,"Pours with a very nice color, with a really deep red brown body and a decent head with good lacing. Actually rather attractive.



To me this lacks many characteristics of a Porter, but IS a decent, malt based brown ale. There are some really nice caramel overtones both in the aroma and the taste and there is a malt bitter balance which is quite pleasing.



Body is lacking but it doesn’t detract too much. It is thin.



A bit unusual to say the least, but I sort of like it! As I say, there are no Porter characteristics as such, but it is drinkable and tasty."

9.3 oz bottle, $6.95 Greens, Buford Highway, Atlanta, GA, USA, 2004 vintage.



First time that I have opened a beer for a period of 24 hours before drinking; done it with wine before, but never with a beer.



Orange, clear, syrupy and viscous pour with a decent finger of tan head produced with an aggresive pour. Head disappears quickly and obviously there is no lacing.



Aromas are all sherry and alcohol, with deep alcohol soaked fruits. It drinks in the same manner with alcohol and sherry upfront, but in the finish it reminds you of its origins as a Barley Wine. A slightly dry, bitter ending rounds out the experience perfectly. Alcohol is there but it doesn't feel anywhere near the 11.5%.



Expensive, certainly, but as an ocassional treat there are few better."

Amber body with a strange lack of head, but sticky lacing! (I don't really understand that, but there you go).



Dry and thin Pale Ale with some bitterness and malt balance which increases as the beer warms. When this is served too cold there is a very distinct lack of body.



Very average Pale Ale instantly forgettable. Perhaps fresher and nearer to the brewery it may be a different experience. but for now his can safely be avoided without missing out on anything."

MUCH, MUCH more mild than a couple of years ago in terms of bitterness. In fact, almost relegated to a Porter! Still has that mild green tinge on the head. MUCH less bitter than a couple of years ago, BUT really lacks the punch of an American RIS. RIS lite.

$4.50 16oz Taco Mac, East West Connector, Austell, GA, USA.
Jet black pour with a tan/mocha head and a faint green tinge to it around the edges; a bit like algae on the surface of a stagnent pond! The head is not retained well and there is very little lacing. As usual this is served way too cold in most establishments and needs time to warm.
Some serious upfront bitterness with some prickly carbonation in the mouthfeel. The bitterness lingers, and although the mouthfeel is decent this most definitely not a smooth drinker.
Quite a pronounced, hoppy, bitter finish. Way out of line for the style.
I'm delighted that Sweetwater is trying this type of beer and I look forward to other experiments soon. The truth is, is that this is not a great beer, but it's a decent effort. It needs the edges taken off a bit."
The Matt Brewing Company,Saranac Belgian Ale,,,Belgian Pale Ale,5.90%,bottle,2.88,2.5,4,3,2,2,2/26/2006,"Way too brown/orange a pour for the style, this looks more like a pale ale than a Belgian pale. Small head, no retention and no lacing - not a promising start.



Aroma is by far the strongest element here. Good, apparently authentic Belgian yeast smell, but it is quickly let down by the watery and weak taste. Mouthfeel follows along the same lines with an insipid effort and the drinkability is below average.



Has potential, and the possibility of being really something, but ultimately it fails. Much too thin and lacking in body."
"Marston, Thompson & Evershed, Plc.",Pedigree,,,English Pale Ale,4.50%,bottle,3.98,3.5,4,4,4,4,2/25/2006,"Classic English Pale Ale, although, in England this is usually simply going to be referred to as ""Bitter"" by most folks, it has a classic pale orange body, with some cloudiness, lots of sediment, a small head and some lacing.
Rounded, soft malts in the mouth with a dry, but creamy hop finish. Obvious session qualities. As expected, mild bitterness is the featured experience. Burton water comes through strong and the combination of Fuggles and Goldings meld beautifully.
Not a patch on a hand-pulled cask version, but decent enough - you have to take what you can get in the ""cask-starved"" USA."

Aggressive carbonation on the pour with a huge head forming in the tall, thin Pilsener glass that I chose. The lacing is impressive on top of the slightly cloudy, lemon body. 
Aroma gives off the earthy, organic notes that one would expect, and that is reflected in the taste too. Obviously very sharp tartness is the main feature, but there is a distinct yeast and wine like character too. Strange flat feel to the bottom of the glass considering the early ""fizz"".
Refreshing as long as you can put up with the tartness, and I can see why these beers are often blended to take the edge off. Pretty interesting and worth a try, but the style won't be for everyone.
The more I drink these types of beers, along with the Wild Ales, the more I am reminded of good old, West Country Cider from England. These traditional, rustic styles have lots in common all over the world."
Brouwerij Het Anker,Gouden Carolus Classic,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,8.50%,bottle,4.3,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,2/20/2006,"This has been hanging around in the cellar, store, rewiew pile and countless other places for a long time - at last a formal review.



Delivered into the Gouden Carolus ""fat"" flute, the pour is good, but the color is a little disappointing. A reddy, brown plum skin color but cloudy. Good head as long as the pour is aggressive, and with that head comes a pretty decent amount of sticky lacing.



Aroma is all plummy raisins with a depth of alcohol and tinge of fruit cake. A sherry like waft is included at the end too. Some port like notes as well, this is a tasty beast. Has a bit of a ""Coke"" feel about it, both in terms of the nose, appearance and sweet tastes.



Tastes reflect the look and the aroma with depth and flavor from start to finish.



Slight extra carbonation in the mouthfeel which adds to the ""coke"" feel. Nice."
Shmaltz Brewing Company (He'Brew),He'Brew Jewbelation 5766 (9),,,American Brown Ale,9.00%,bottle,4.65,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,5,2/20/2006,"Very, very impressed.



Delicious looking pour. Deep, deep red, mahogany brown, the depth of color is second to none. Head is large with some lacing, but it fades a little on standing.



Aroma and tastes reflect the pour and are deep, deep malts with a nutty overtone and a sugary mouthfeel. Slight hop bitterness in the finish but it's slight and it complements the rest of the beer to produce an unusual balance.



This an amazing, ""Imperial"" (souped up) American version of a Brown Ale. One of the best beers I have enjoyed in a while. Delicious!"
Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),Samuel Adams White Ale,,,Witbier,5.20%,bottle,3.68,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,2/19/2006,"Poured with an orange hue, but a good looking cloudy, unfiltered appearance. Half-decent head and some sticky, if somewhat conservative lacing.
Spiced and smooth aroma, with a really quite full mouthfeel. Chunky on the palate.
Taste is where things start getting complicated. I get a certain initial spice (maybe coriander), but this rapidly changes in to a wild peppermint!? The peppermint to me is very strong and overpowering. My imagination? I don't know, but it was very odd!
Pretty refreshingly drinkable as long as it's a warm day and the beer is NOT served at a freezing temperature (let it warm a little). A bit harsh on a cold day.
Not your typical Wit, either in terms of color or in terms of taste, but worth investigating nonetheless."
Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,Pangaea,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,7.00%,bottle,3.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,2/19/2006,"Bottled 11/14/05.
Poured into the St. Bernardus chalice from the capped 750 mL bottle, it is absolutely crystal clear with an orange/golden hue. For those with British connections the body is a Lucozade color. Fine bubbles of carbonation form on the surface, but produces no head or lacing to speak of.
There is a slight (and I mean slight) ginger aroma in the nose and a sweet lemony smell.
This is a thirst quencher alright, and if you are English this tastes almost identical to a basic bitter shandy. A combination of a classic English bitter plus British lemonade (Sprite, 7-Up).
I am a HUGE fan of DFH in general, and this beer will seem like a continuation of their ""envelope pushing"" to most American BA's, but the taste of a simple bitter shandy will be utterly inescapable for anyone from the UK. As a result, although this is very drinkable, this is one of DFH's less brilliant offerings and is horrible value for money in terms of the experience."
Rock Bottom Restaurant And Brewery,Hooch Pilsener,,,German Pilsener,4.90%,on-tap,3.58,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,2/19/2006,"Pretty decent Pils with a good mouthfeel and nice look being its best qualities.



Aroma's and tastes are standard, but the yellow body is topped by a good head and decent lacing that are both above average. Less hoppy than many in the style and there is definitely a lack of bite in the finish, but the extra, unexpected depth in the body makes up for that. Slightly out of style in that respect, but nevertheless a decent drinker."
Rock Bottom Restaurant And Brewery,IPA,,,American IPA,?,cask,4,4,4,4,4,4,2/19/2006,"The beer I drank was ""The Loop"" IPA which I am going to assume is the same as the one listed here. They advertise this a cask conditioned(?) it comes with a great looking cloudy appearance and a strong, sharp, single hop aroma. A nice looking beer certainly.



Tastes are sharp grapefruit with a short drying finish. Solid American version of the IPA.



Easy drinker and satisfying, I was quite impressed."
Thomas Hooker Ales & Lagers,Thomas Hooker Imperial Porter,,,American Porter,7.80%,bottle,3.7,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,2/18/2006,"1.0 L swingtop, an impressive presentation but it does set the bar very high for what follows. 2005 vintage.



Black body, with brown highlights at the bottom of the glass. Large head initially but not much retention. Some layered lacing.



Well, it's difficult for me to distinguish this from a strong stout. Whatever ""Imperial"" means in this context (and it is a moving target) it imparts a fairly harsh roasted bitterness and a sharp hop based finish here.



Drinkable and I enjoyed it, but I prefer a Porter with a softer edge than this. This lacks a serious creamy edge that I seek in my Porters."
Lake Superior Brewing Company,Old Man Winter Warmer,,,English Barleywine,10.30%,bottle,4.53,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,2/17/2006,"Gosh, this is good. Coming in at 10.30% it's a big hitter, but the drinkability is still astonishing.



Ruby red which is cloudy in a chill hazed manner, but it looks like a lot of sediment rather than a temperature effect. Attractive, thin espresso type film on the top of the body, with a minimal amount of lacing.



Heavy with raisins, plums and sugary alcohol, this is an enormous malt, fruit bomb. It has some port character too. It manages to pull all of those dispirate threads together in a delicious manner. 



A tiny bit of hop bitterness, and yeast in the short finish, but nothing to speak of.



Interestingly, the brewery describes this as a ""Barleywine Style Ale"", but I think the Winter Warmer designation is much better, even with some doppelbockcharacter! It's a big beer no doubt, but it pulls it off deliciously."
Heavyweight Brewing Co.,Lunacy,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,7.70%,bottle,3.98,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,2/16/2006,"Golden, honey orange pour with excellent fine carbonation that leads to a thin filmed head and some lacing. Poured into the Val-Dieu chalice, this looks very good.



Sweet tastes, sugary but finishes short and dry with a little bit of bitterness. Some yeasty flavors. Some alcohol in the finish.



Not a bad interpretation of a Belgian Pale. It lacks a bit of body and depth, but I enjoyed it."
"Bell's Brewery, Inc.",Bell's Kalamazoo Stout,,,American Stout,6.00%,bottle,4.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,2/15/2006,"Jet black, inky pour with some very small red highlights at the bottom of the glass when held up to strong light. Small but perfectly formed, mocha coffee head and some decent lacing.



Creamy mouthfeel and a classic lactose, sweet stout nose and taste. A very, very mild smokiness lightly touches the senses, but there is no roastiness at all. Very mild.



A tiny bit of bitterness in the finish but its insignificant and the drinkability is exceptional.



Perfect balance. Delicious."
The Matt Brewing Company,Saranac Oatmeal Stout,,,Oatmeal Stout,5.10%,bottle,2.58,2.5,2,3,2,2.5,2/14/2006,"Dark brown body with some attractive ruby red highlights at the bottom of the glass. Decent if somewhat small tan head, and a little lacing but not very significant.



Very thin body and a weak mouthfeel.



Aroma is farily non-descript with a little bit of chocolate.



Taste has some chocolate notes, but it is dry like cocoa powder rather than silky like a creamy chocolate. Dry finish. Lack of roasted flavors is distinct.



Not at all what I am looking for in a stout. Lack of body, lack of smoothness and not much flavor. Drinks more like a bad Porter."
Left Hand Brewing Company,Warrior IPA,,,American IPA,7.60%,bottle,4.08,4.5,5,4,3.5,3.5,2/12/2006,"Very clear, orange body with some significant streams of carbonation coming from the bottom of the glass. Large, fluffy and rocky head with some layered and sticky lacing. Good looker without a doubt.



Nose is VERY strong with huge hops of the pine and citrus variety. This made me wary of the taste, but with the large hops that DO come in the flavor, there is some malt balance.



Finish is dry, even puckering a times, and every gulp comes with a fairly serious hop assault on the nose.



My guess is that hopheads will love this, but at the same time there is some balance for the rest of us."
Rogue Brewery (Brewer's on the Bay),Juniper Pale Ale,,,Herbed / Spiced Beer,5.30%,bottle,3.48,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,2/12/2006,"Cloudy yellow pour with a good head and some lacing. Decent carbonation leads to a nice appearance.
Pleasing hoppy bitterness that seemed balanced (unusually so for Rogue) with only a hint of the herbal/spice that the Juniper is presumably supposed to generate.
Pretty dry all the way through particularly in the short finish.
Easy drinking and a bit of a novelty but worth a try."

The Matt Brewing Company,Saranac Nut Brown Ale,,,English Brown Ale,5.70%,bottle,3.38,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,2/10/2006,"Not a great beer but a decent effort.



Color was much too light for my liking in terms of the style but on the upside it did come with a nice spotty head and some decent lacing.



Yeasty type aroma, average mouthfeel.



Bitterness is upfront and lasting and there is a lack of noticeable malts which serve to give the beer a metallic and sharp edge. I like a maltier base to my Brown Ales, and a little more sweetness. I miss the nuttiness that others speak of.



Drinkable despite the slightly odd features of the beer in general, and to be fair I quite enjoyed it."

Original Review 02/06
===
Great looking red pour with some head but it fades quickly. Obviously little or no persistent head or lacing.
Sweet cherry medicinal aromas with alcohol featuring prominently.
Tastes are sweet and alcoholic. An easy sipper that lacks a massive hop bite, and relies upon alcohol to take it into the parameters of the style.
Mouthfeel is slightly drying because of the ABV, but it strikes a good balance of syrup and texture.
All in all, very nice. It will disappoint those who are looking for a huge hop bite, but for those of us happy to enjoy an English style BW it hits the spot."
Greene King / Morland Brewery,Hop,,,English Pale Mild Ale,5.00%,bottle,3.85,3,3.5,4,4,4,2/9/2006,"Rather odd. (Originally reviewed when the beer was called, ""The Beer to Dine For"" in the 750 mL capped bottles). Purchased at Roller's on HHI, SC, USA.
Presentation and name are obviously an attempt to make people think about their beer in the same way they think about their wine - that is, as a drink to pair with food. Now, although that is a noble goal in itself, the name and the bottle (it's a clear one) are just too contrived to take very seriously, and frankly make the beer look a bit silly. It's all compounded by being produced by a brewery that ought to know better, and the fact that despite appearances, this is a pretty decent drink.
Typical Euro, macro-lager pour with an ultra clear yellow body, decent carbonation but not much head, but a relatively surprisingly large amount of lacing.
Very soft, easy drinking, light and sweet in aroma and taste. Nice balance with a very small hop presence against the malt background.
Slightly better than average, I feel that it lacks something and I think it is a hop punch. It's actually close to being a really rather good beer, but the marketing angle is a bit of a mystery to me, and frankly it looks a bit daft."
Independence Brew Pub,Oatmeal Stout,,,Oatmeal Stout,5.00%,on-tap,4.08,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,2/9/2006,"Really enjoyed this brew.



Standard dark pour with a nice looking, bubbly tan head. I allowed it to warm significantly before tucking in.



Roasted flavors, but very, very light and therefore super-drinkable. The mouthfeel was thinner than expected, but surprisingly this did not detract from the experience. Rather than making it feel thin, it just added to the drinkability.



Not huge aromas, but what there are are simple chocolate and butterscotch standards.



Nice, slightly off-base version of the style, lighter than most, but it seemed to work. Somewhat Porter-like."
Smuttynose Brewing Company,"Smuttynose IPA ""Finest Kind""",,,American IPA,6.90%,bottle,3.9,4,4,4,4,3.5,2/8/2006,"Light colored with an orange base, pretty clear with an excellent head and some lovely, layered lacing.



Very fresh hops, green and young on the nose and on the palate. This drinks very citrusy, with a serious grapefruit taste. It is really quite bitter with a dry, puckering finish.



Fairly clean and refreshing, but the acute bitterness could get rather grating after a while I feel. The bitterness makes this very ""non-sessionable""."
Anderson Valley Brewing Company,Boont ESB,,,Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB),6.80%,bottle,3.98,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,2/7/2006,"Thick, golden looking beer with viscous appearance and a chill haze. Nice, small rocky head with some sticky lacing.
Soapy aroma.
Tastes are nicely balanced with some really quite aggressive hops, but balanced with some substantial malt sweetness.
Way too hoppy to be an ESB in my opinion, but ignoring the style it is a very nice beer.
Full bodied and satisfying, easy to drink and it really feels like you are drinking a substantial beer. High drinkability."
Southampton Publick House,Southampton IPA,,,American IPA,6.50%,bottle,3.18,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,2/7/2006,"Decent example of the style, but considering both the ability of Southampton to produce some great beers, and the fact that the American version of the IPA usually goes the extra mile, this was a little disappointing. Perhaps that is unfair, but when a brewery sets such high standards, then subsequently middle-of-the-road, OK beers, will tend to disappoint.
22oz bomber. Orange body and plenty of chill haze with some, but no a great deal of head. The head does leave much better than average lacing though.
Citrusy nose and initial taste, but overall the hops are very muted, even to the point of being a little bland. I'm certainly no hop-head, but I even found this a little uninspiring.
Solid beer, but seriously lacks character or inspiration. Lots of other IPA's will perform just as well.
One of Southampton's more average efforts."
Top of the Hill Restaurant and Brewery,Ellie's ESB,,,Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB),4.10%,on-tap,2.75,2,2,3,3,3,2/7/2006,"ESB? I increasingly find that the American version of the ESB is somewhat removed from what I consider to be a true English Bitter - this was another example of that divide.



Way too pale to fall into my version of the style, this smelled, drank and looked like a watered down version of an English bitter. It tasted significantly better, but still was bland and lack punch.



A dry beer, with some balance, but just rather insipid."
"August Schell Brewing Co., Inc.",Oktoberfest,,,Märzen / Oktoberfest,5.50%,bottle,2.93,2.5,2.5,3,3.5,3,2/6/2006,"Copper haze with a lot of cloudiness, initial decent head, but this fades very quickly to leave no head and no lacing. Rather flat looking all around.



Pretty bland in all departments. Sweet malts and a little bit of a bitter finish, but outside of that a disappointing Marzen."
The Matt Brewing Company,Saranac Winter Wassail,,,Winter Warmer,5.80%,bottle,2.83,3.5,2.5,3,3,2.5,2/6/2006,"Part of the mixed 12 pack from Saranac.



Nice looking pour, a red body that is very, very clear and is topped by a bone white head, but it doesn't last long and as a result there is not much lacing.



Aroma is a diluted cinnamon.



Taste is a little strange and seems artificial. Definite spice notes, but this coupled with some metallic notes as well. Finishes fast with a puckering, spiced dry feel.



I've had much, much worse, but much, much better too, so it's very middle-of-the-pack. $9.99 for the 12 pack though, so still decent value."
Independence Brew Pub,Imperial Stout,,,Russian Imperial Stout,?,on-tap,4.25,4,4,4,4.5,5,2/5/2006,"Delicious.



A lighter version of the massive American versions of this beer for sure (the very phrase RIS conjours up thoughts of mind blowing excess), but of course the pay-off is that you get subtleties and grace that a massive smack you in the face American version lacks. Don't get me wrong, I love many of the American versions too, but many of them lack the craft of a beer like this.



Jet black pour and a tan head that produces nice lacing. Smooth as silk on the way down, with mild and creamy chocolate and milk tones too. Yeast notes in the nose.



Insanely drinkable because of the lack of massive alcohol, bitterness and other harsh elements often found in the style, this was an excellent beer in my opinion."
Oskar Blues Grill & Brewery,G'Knight Imperial Red Ale,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,8.70%,can,3.8,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,2/5/2006,"Very good looking beer, with deep, deep browns and reds making up the body, a small but nice head and then some serious, sticky and persistent lacing.



Hops dominante the aroma, but the taste is not as bitterly hoppy as the aroma suggests. Quite metallic tasting in fact and on warming this becomes increasingly apparent. The bitterness becomes quite bland over time.



Interesting, and the alcohol is immensely well hidden (this is close to 10%), this worth a try. I bet that many BA's will really enjoy this, to me it was above average, but not as spectacular as some seem to think."
Oskar Blues Grill & Brewery,Old Chub - Scottish Style Ale,,,Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy,8.00%,can,4.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,2/5/2006,"Very nice.



Amazing dark brown, ruby red highlighted beer, with a thick and bubbly head and some significant, sticky, persistent lacing.



Chocolate, smoky malts appear in the nose, and are intensified in the initial tastes. Alcohol begins to penetrate with a little bitterness, but the power of the sweet malts continue right through to end. Substantial mouthfeel, partly from the alcohol



Essentially this is an intense, high alcohol brown ale and it's delicious. At $6.99 for a sixer of 12 oz cans this is also exceptional value."
Victory Brewing Company,Prima Pils,,,German Pilsener,5.30%,on-tap,3.85,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,2/5/2006,"On-tap, Sansom Oyster House, Philadelphia.
Absolutely crystal clear appearance, to the point of being clinical, golden, pale yellow color, small tight head with a minimal amount of lacing.
Hops dominate the smell, and I certainly agree that there is a pepper/spice/herbal note to them.
Some creaminess in the mouthfeel.
It drinks exactly as you would expect. Clean, bitter, hoppy and peppered. Some Saaz like bitterness in the finish and aftertaste too.
Good thirst quenching characteristics, but not eye-catching rather just a very solid example of the style. Often quoted as the quintessential example of an American version of the style, it's hard to argue with that opinion."
Harviestoun Brewery Ltd.,Bitter & Twisted,,,English India Pale Ale (IPA),4.20%,bottle,3.25,2.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,2/4/2006,"Very, very light color for the style with a golden color and good carbonation. Some decent lacing but not very special.



Hoppy bitterness up front, this drinks and looks very much like a decent Pilsner. Very, very odd indeed in terms of the style.



Peppery bitterness in the nose and reflected in the taste.



Finishes rather dry with a hop twang.



Don't really understand this as an ESB, but there you go. EDIT: Changed from ESB category on 2/4/06."
Russian River Brewing Company,Damnation,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,7.80%,bottle,4.53,4,4,4.5,5,5,2/4/2006,"Batch 003, 750 mL corked & caged.



Deep golden yellow poured into the Trois Pistoles chalice. Small, but beautifully formed, dense white pillowy head, but the retention and the lacing are both below average.



Lots of banana, cloves and spice, but comes with an acidic edge too. In simple terms it drinks like a high alcohol Hefe, but at the same time is very, very reminiscent of a Duvel. That of course, is high praise indeed. Finishes with a slight grapefruit/citrus twang.



Lovely creamy and full mouthfeel and a fantastc drinkability.



High quality."
Lagunitas Brewing Company,Maximus,,,American Double / Imperial IPA,8.20%,bottle,3.95,4,4,4,3.5,4,2/2/2006,"Originally purchased and drunk In Philadelphia and then later in early September 2006 when Lagunitas made in to GA for the first time.



Pretty easy drinking beer condsidering it it categorized as a double IPA. Clear, orangey/copper pour with a nice looking ivory head and a little lacing. Nice balanced aroma with hops taking the lead but not grating.



The tastes were certainly citrus based, but not aggressive. A little dry in the finish, and the mouthfeel was slightly thin. Some good sweet fresh pine resinous hops which make for a very tasty brew.



Outside of that it drinks and performs like a quality, crafted IPA, but not like a huge hop bomb. Given the ""double"" moniker, I was expecting more in the hop department, but still enjoyed the simplicity of this brew."
Legacy Brewing Co.,Hedonism Ale,,,American Amber / Red Ale,7.10%,bottle,3.13,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,2/2/2006,"Can you say grapefruit juice? Red/Amber Ale? More like a heavily hopped IPA. Having tasted this and reviewed it I was very surprised to see so many high reviews, I thought this was decidedly average.



Decent clear copper look, nice head and some lacing.



Then we get a nice hop nose, but a very bitter taste. Slightly unbalanced, but a little sweetness present.



It's OK, but much more IPA like than Amber."
Rogue Brewery (Brewer's on the Bay),Santa's Private Reserve Ale,,,American Amber / Red Ale,6.00%,bottle,2.53,4.5,2.5,2,3,3,2/2/2006,"Absolutely, 100% typically Rogue. This is an unbalanced beer with cutting, citrus hops overwhelming everything else, to the detriment of everything else.



Good looking beer, with a really nice color, lovely big fluffy head and some excellent layered lacing. The appearance is by far its best quality.



Mild hops in the nose, but this mild mannered start to the experience is quickly dispelled a thin mouthfeel, big, big hop profile and a brutally dry finish that saps the enjoyment from the beer.



(As an aside, I would MUCH prefer a beer called ""Santa's Private Reserve"" to be a seasonal, winter warmer style or spiced Christmas ale, rather than just a hugely hopped amber ale. To be fair, Rogue doesn't claim that this is anything but that, but it seems a bit silly to have such a style associated with such a name).



This unbalanced beer is SO Rogue!"
Hair of the Dog Brewing Company / Brewery and Tasting Room,Adam,,,Old Ale,10.00%,bottle,3.7,4,2.5,4,4,4,2/1/2006,"Batch 60.



Pours very dark brown, almost black with a large head. Lacing is thick, sticky and copious.



Aroma is promising at first, but then a sharp cider smell wafts in and significantly subtracts from the aroma experience.



The taste masks the apple flavors, via the deep fruitcake and alcohol flavors that are upfront and delicious. It drinks much better than it smells. Large alcohol is obvious, and this is a rich beer. A little bit of bitterness in the finish but not much.



Good, coating mouthfeel and a good drinkability."
Nodding Head Brewery and Restaurant,George's Fault,,,Herbed / Spiced Beer,9.00%,on-tap,3.88,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,1/31/2006,"Very interesting. Strikes an unusual balance between a Tripel and a Dubbel for me, with the honey definitely giving the Tripel sweetness, but whatever spices are present creating an interesting, darker feel.



Dubbel like appearance, dark brown and a small head and little lacing, with sweetness of honey the power in the aroma. I didn't really pick up much coriander or orange in either the nose or the taste as advertised, but there was a sort of peppery twang in the finish. Alcohol at 9.00% is well hidden.



Served in a small glass (10oz?) this was a pretty interesting beer. Definitely a departure from the norm."
Nodding Head Brewery and Restaurant,Grog,,,English Brown Ale,5.30%,on-tap,3.45,2.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,4,1/31/2006,"Decent Brown Ales are difficult things to get right in my opinion, and this sort of fell between two stools. The malty sweetness is there in the nose and the taste (which is a good thing), but the mouthfell let it down somewhat. A little too thin and watery for my taste.



Nice deep brown appearance, but lack of head and lacing definitely detracts form the look. There was a little chocolate in there, but I didn't feel there was as much as some others have noted. The light drinking does mean that it has session possibilites, but frankly I would prefer a Brown that was more substantial.

Nice looking pale orange pour with some chill haze. Small, but perfectly formed head, not much lacing, what there is, is fairly watery.



Malt acidic sweetness in the nose. Not a strong smell at all.



Tastes are sweet malts. It's much sweeter than I was anticipating, and it drinks fairly sweet too. Small bitter finish with a tinge of hops, but not much to speak of. Smooth, nice mouthfeel.



Yes, this is an above average brew, and it IS a drinkable beer, but at the same time it seems very, very ordinary for a brewery that is so well thought of for its 20th anniversary beer. In that respect it is disappointing."

Chill-hazed copper body, with a lot of thin carbonation on the pour - almost categorized by me as fizzy! The color is somewhere between the traditional colors of the Belgian Pale and Dark.
Mild fruits and spices in the nose, but the tastes are more pronounced than the nose would suggest.
Mouthfeel is rather thin.
Tastes are malt based, but a definite yeast based bitterness cuts across the finish and lingers. The dry alcohol is also apparent in the finish. Slightly soapy taste.
Not the best American version of Belgian in the US by a long chalk, and all in all a little disappointing."
Otter Creek Brewing / Wolaver's,Double Decker (Otter Creek World Tour),,,Old Ale,7.50%,bottle,4.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,1/29/2006,"Firstly I'm unconvinced that this is an Old Ale. If you read the label carefully, and consult the brewery web site, it classifies it as an ""Olde English Ale"" which is significantly different to an Old Ale. This is really an ESB or a Winter Warmer.



Great noisy pour, with a deep red/brown body, a delicious thick head, some lacing and a deep malty aroma. The mouthfeel is full and satisfying. The malts are the bulk of the taste with plenty of sweetness making up the initial tastes. Then comes the balance with a hop finish that is short and perfectly rounds the beer.



A little spice too (maybe some corriander?) and you have a super beer for winter's in by the fire. Lots of body and depth and he alcohol is very, very well hidden."
Three Floyds Brewing Co. / Brewery & Pub,Pride & Joy Mild Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),5.00%,bottle,2.63,2,2.5,2.5,3,3,1/29/2006,"I'm very, very confused. All my experience of drinking English Milds has revolved around beers that look like Porters - dark, smooth, fairly thin but malty. This beer looks and drinks like a cross between an APA and a IPA. It's OK, but I can't imagine why this is classified as an English mild, it doesn't match ANY of my expectations for the style at all.
*(Subsequently changed in the BA database to an APA - I was RIGHT!)
To summarize this beer, simply think of a weak IPA. Copper color, low carbonation, not much head and no lacing. Mild hops present, without much malt to balance it at all.
Finishes slightly metallic and dry.
I'm confused."
Brasserie d'Achouffe,McChouffe,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,8.00%,bottle,3.53,3,3.5,3.5,3,4,1/28/2006,"Typical Belgian Dubbel appearance, with that rathy nasty, dirty dishwater, muddy brown color. Small head and some lacing, but not much.



Fruity alcohol in the nose.



Some dry, yeasty alcohol up front and of course lots of candied sugar. Not much of the Scotch Ale influence, rather a weakish, thin Belgian dark ale that somewhat disappointed me."
North Coast Brewing Co.,Ruedrich's Red Seal Ale,,,American Amber / Red Ale,5.50%,bottle,3.53,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,1/28/2006,"Peach body with some chill haze, a nice half-inch head and some decent lacing. The lacing is sticky, thick and persistent.



Nose is sweet hops, not large, but noticeable.



Much hoppier and more bitter than I was expecting. The initial tastes are really quite bitter and metallic. There is a lot of malt to balance the initial hoopiness out, and as the beer is drunk, the bitterness fades to give a pretty balanced brew.



Dry finish. 



Nice interpretation of the style, with added hops to make it more interesting."
Rogue Brewery (Brewer's on the Bay),Younger's Special Bitter,,,English Bitter,4.80%,bottle,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,1/28/2006,"Light amber pour with some chill haze and a nice full head. Some decent lacing too.



Aroma is of mild hops, but generally pretty non-descript.



Extremely middle of the road bitter. Balanced malt profile with a small amount of bitterness in the finish, but very little to report. A fairly dry finish too.



Refreshing, but lacks depth and body.



Session possibilities, but not especially captivating in any way."
Cropton Brewery,Cropton's Calamity Ale / Uncle Sam's Bitter,,,English Bitter,4.40%,bottle,4.03,3.5,5,4,3.5,3.5,1/27/2006,"Toffee and butterscotch body is topped with a huge head and some cloudiness in the bulk of the beer. The carbonation is massive in the bottle and gets just a little annoying on the pour.



Malty alcohol is a wonderful treat for the nose and this is the best part of the brew. This is followed up by the mixed fruit alcohol and then some really quite bitter hops in the finish. Actually quite metallic. Strangely pitched against the metallic hops is a cloying sweetness - a very odd combo!



This seems to drink way, way higher than the 4.40% ABV. It really seems like a hefty brew.



A bit odd, not really what I was expecting and it was a bit of a different beer. Not something to try very often, but certainly worth a visit."
Hair of the Dog Brewing Company / Brewery and Tasting Room,Rose,,,Tripel,7.60%,bottle,3.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,1/27/2006,"Simple pour into the goblet, with a peach colored hue, spotty head and a little bit of lacing. 



Rather odd taste, it has the the tripel sweetness but coming with it is some kind of milk chocolate taste. Some peppery alcohol in the taste. A dry finish with some floral lightness.



Not a bad interpretation, but a bit different too. Worth a quick visit but I doubt that I would come back to this - I prefer the more traditional interpretation."
Carolina Brewery,Flagship IPA,,,English India Pale Ale (IPA),5.70%,on-tap,3.1,4,3,3,2.5,3.5,1/26/2006,"Classic orange color, but lacking in body. Pretty good lacing with lots of soapy character. Floral and oily hops make up the nose and the taste but the aroma lacks depth.



A real light drinker, which is OK, but if you like some decent body and depth in your IPA you will probably be disappointed."
J.W. Lees & Co (Brewers) Ltd,Moonraker Ale,,,Winter Warmer,7.50%,bottle,4.83,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,1/26/2006,"Deep, deep dark colors of varying hues, but dominating by an ultra attractive ruby highlight package toward the bottom of the glass. Some head and a little lacing, but not big.



The beer is fruity, alcoholic, mild, port-like and has great depth. In fact the depth is the real strength of this beer. It gives the beer a beautiful mouthfeel and a huge drinkability.



Amazingly tasty with sweet malt backbone and caramel and sugary flavors.



A great beer, and not what one would expect from a Winter Warmer, in fact I found more in common with an Old Ale."
Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),Samuel Smith's Organically Produced Lager Beer,,,Euro Pale Lager,5.00%,bottle,4.33,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,1/25/2006,"Extremely smooth, with a sweet sensation from the golden pour. Lots of clarity and some decent carbonation. Not much head or lacing.



Some grassy aroma's dominate, but not in any kind of funky way. The tastes are quite sweet, but the overwhelming sensation that is left behind is a highly drinkable smoothness. Easy drinking, refreshing and smooth. Nice."

This is certainly a much hoppier version of the original (English) style and I think the beer suffers as a result. In Brown Ales I am looking for a sweet, malty smooth beer but the hop presence here gives it an edge that is not very welcome in the (original) style for me.



Original notes 1/22/06: (bottle)



Nice looking beer with good clarity and nice deep brown color - classic brown ale look. A small head and a little bit of lacing.



The classic looks are followed by a nice sweet aroma and then the usual sweet caramel characteristics of a quality brown ale. The finish is where things start to turn a little odd. A much shorter and drier finish than normally exected from a brown ale, and a much larger hop and alcohol profile than expected.



The hops give the beer a distinct American feel rather than a classic English feel. Most definitely a different beer from the original style."
Young & Co Brewery PLC,Young's St. George's Ale,,,English Pale Ale,4.30%,bottle,4.45,4.5,4,4.5,4,5,1/22/2006,"Classic English session ale, which, out of the the bottle is delicious, but I suspect from the cask would be stunning (I have no idea if this is available in cask form, but if not it should be).



Fairly pale orange body, with some nice carbonation, a huge head and some lovely lacing. It looks very inviting. Great body and very flavorful.



The malts are large, upfront and creamy. Perfectly rounded in the mouth and a slightly (very slightly) bitter finish.



I could drink gallons of this, and if you had to define the style this would be a good candidate."

12 oz bottle thanks to Penney for bringing this back from Bloomington. As before the hop based IPA character comes through and no way in the world would I guess that this is a APWA.

Brasserie Dubuisson Frères sprl,Bush Ambrée,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,12.00%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,1/16/2006,"250 mL bottle, great looking orange foil and nice orange and green color scheme on the label.



Pour shows that deep golden, viscous liquid that begins to give away the alcohol content immediately. Nice film left as a head, not as spotty as some. Some scant lacing.



Aromas are sugary floral notes.



Taste is certainly alcohol based, but not as pronounced as many reviews have noted prior to mine. Actually this is very drinkable. the alcohol is obviously present, but I can really enjoy sipping it. Some floral notes in the taste too.



Some Belgian influence present, but drinks more like a ""light"" Barleywine (if that makes sense??)"
Great Divide Brewing Company,Saint Bridget's Porter,,,American Porter,5.90%,bottle,4,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,1/15/2006,"All very simple and good.



Standard pour, with great looking black body and creaminess around the head. Mouthfeel is super.



Mild coffee overtones in both the nose and the taste, but it's not overpowering and is very simple.



Enjoyable, goes down real easy and has the creamy aspect that I like in my Porters.



Very nice example of the style, sticks to a tried and tested formula and does a nice job."

Pours with good, dark brown, varnished wood appearance, a small head and a little lacing. The color certainly suggests a serious malt bomb.



Aroma is malt, with some smoke and wood character.



Tastes are light malts and light alcohol with a tiny bit of bitterness in the finish, but just fail to come up to scratch for me.



Mouthfeel is light and a little thin. I'd like much more body, and as such it leaves me wanting a little more.



Drinkability is OK, but it just feels like there is something missing. Needs body, alcohol, malt or something, but all in all leaves me a little dissatisfied."
Brasserie de l'Abbaye du Val-Dieu,Val-Dieu Winter,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,10.50%,bottle,4.88,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,1/14/2006,"This is designed to be a sipper, but because of its sheer deliciousness, its actually difficult not to gulp this down at an alarming rate of knots.



Conker (Horse-chestnut) brown body, with a lovely, spotty creamy head with ultra-fine bubbles of carbonation present. A little lacing, but nice thin film retention.



All the dark fruit aromas (plums and balck grapes) that one would expect from the style, but we get the additional smells of vanilla and deep, smooth alcohol thrown in. The sheer depth of this beer is immense, and coupled with the smoothness and taste this becomes an exceptional beer.



Warming on the way down, the alcohol is prominent but balanced and the sweetness is superb. Creamy mouthfeel tops off this great brew. By far the best beer that this brewer produces."
Rome Street Tavern Grill,Carroll Oak Brown,,,American Brown Ale,?,on-tap,1.4,3.5,1,1.5,1.5,1,1/14/2006,"OK, back to RSTG to give the beer another try a few months after the initial, disappointing visit. If this Brown Ale is anything to go by, things are no better, and I suspect we are at the point where things are unlikely to improve to any extent. They have now been open for a year, and to be honest we should be seeing some improvement - we're not. From conversations I had with employees, they certainly see food as the main source of income and the beer ""brewed"" on site is most definitely not the focus of this operation.



Back to the beer. Decent looking pint with good color, some head with nice retention, and some decent lacing, but that is where the good stuff ends.



The aroma is still very, very acidic with apples dominating the smell. Cider like aromas are very strong, and there remains the suspicion that their beers are infected.



Apple acid is carried forward into the taste, admittedly not as strong as in the aroma, but still the main feature.



Looking for the malty, deep body of a brown will be a pointless exercise here, as all we have is a weak, watery fluid with little or no taste.



There's no way I could get this down easily and certainly no way I would ever drink this in its current format ever again."
New Belgium Brewing,1554 Enlightened Black Ale,,,Belgian Dark Ale,5.60%,bottle,3.93,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,1/11/2006,"Dark, dark brown with plenty of ruby red highlights. Not much head and what little lacing there is, is fairly watery.
Nice malt aroma with a very sweet, burned sugar type taste. Reminds me a lot of a brown ale crossed with a schwarzbier.
Above average drinkability, but at the same time give me a well-crafted brown ale everytime instead."
Clipper City Brewing Co. / Heavy Seas Beer,Heavy Seas - Loose Cannon (Hop3 Ale),,,American IPA,7.30%,bottle,4.43,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,1/10/2006,"Very, very clear pour with some very good, persistent fine bubble lines rising from the bottom of the glass to create a small head and some nice lacing.



Strong and heavy hop aromas obviously dominate.



Taste is really fruity hops, with a serious grapefruit citrus bitterness and quite dry.



Drinks well below the ABV, but at the same time is very satisfying in the alcohol department.



Very tasty overall with the unusual combination of heavy hop bitterness but excellent fruitiness. As such, this is an interesting beer to introduce to someone as a very drinkable, but still aggressive hoppy beer."

Rogue Brewery (Brewer's on the Bay),Morimoto Imperial Pilsner,,,American Double / Imperial Pilsner,8.80%,bottle,4.3,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,1/8/2006,"OK, this review will be a little biased since I bought this for $3.99 rather than (up to) $16.99 that I have seen in Atlanta. At this price, this beer is a straight 5. At $12, $13, $14 or $15 a bottle it isn't.



Great, butterscotch and lemon apppearance, with a massive head, chill haze, carbonation and a real viscous feel make up a wonderful look.



Aroma? Well, the best way I can describe it is as an expensive Euro Lager (Stella on acid). Hoppy and malty, and at the same time, the viscous feel seems to seep into the aroma?? I know that makes little sense but I get that feeling.



Syrupy, rich thickness dominates the taste, and this is unlike any Pilsner you will have drunk. In fact, there is an argument to say that the ""Imperialness"" of a Pilsner is just silly. It takes away the lightness and freshing drinkability of the style, and replaces it with a punishing brew that is great, but significantly removed from the original style. Sugary, alcoholic and smooth.



At $3.99 this unbeatable, at $17.00 at bottle it's a one-off purchase."
Privatbrauerei Franz Inselkammer KG / Brauerei Aying,Ayinger Ur-Weisse,,,Dunkelweizen,5.80%,bottle,4.63,4,5,4.5,5,4.5,1/7/2006,"Pretty light colored for a DW, but a HUGE, classic head forms in the Tucher Weizen glass. This glass is (obviously!) perfect for this beer. There is a definite, cloudy chill haze apparent.



Aroma is the classic banana/clove combo, but at the same time there is a definite acidic quality. This acid carries through to the taste, to introduce a real unique quality to this beer, and making it a stand out its style. Delicious.



Very, very soft in the mouth, almost cotton-like, and as a result this leads to a very, very healthy drinkability.



I'm not made about DW's in general, but this is super."
Stone Brewing Co.,Stone 04.04.04 Vertical Epic Ale,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,8.50%,bottle,3.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,1/6/2006,"What an unusual beer.



Poured into the Duvel tulip, there is an orange/golden body (looks a lot like lucozade) with a big frothy/rocky head but very little lacing to speak of. We get some spotty thin head left on the surface of the beer, and the Duvel tulip engraving continues produce bubbles of carbonation.



Yeast and peach/apricot are the overwhelming aromas - the peach/apricot is really strong and reminds me of an aromatic shower gel! I know this doesn't sound really nice, but it is not bad!



Taste is very, very, very floral. It's all flowers, with a tiny bit of sweetness and a very short, small, dry finish. It's so unusual it's the kind of thing you could serve as an aperitif in place of a light bodied wine, or indeed with a desert.



Drinkability is OK, but there is no way I could drink much of this since the flavor is a bit odd.



Not the best beer that Stone makes by a long chalk, but at the same time worth a least one try."
New Glarus Brewing Company,Black Wheat,,,Dunkelweizen,5.70%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,1/5/2006,"Not my favorite style, but a pretty nice example.



The bottle that I had a much more brownish color than some of the other reviwers suggested. The black color was not as prevelant as other people has observed. Nice off-white head with a little patchy lacing.



Definite banana, nut, caramel and clove highlights in both the nose and the tastes, and this is reminiscent of a banana-nut muffin. 



A bit of a strange minty taste in the after taste too, but quite pleasing.



Nice creamy mouthfeel and very good drinkability. 



A nice candidate for a breakfast beer!"

Nice, small but perfectly formed dense white head and some really nice lacing with good retention.



The aroma seems sweet and fruity.



Up front tastes are sweet malts, with a little zesty bitterness, but not really much hop character. The small hop bitterness comes in the finish and lingers a little in the aftertaste, and again ones gets a little bit of a citrus ""zing"" to finish the drink. A tiny bit of grapefruit lingers a little.



Decent mouthfeel and a pretty nice drinkability. Not a classic ESB in my opinion, but a decent beer."

Very nice golden color with a fairly fast fading head and some lacing. A little chill haze. Nose is sweet and sugary but not much else.



Nice thirst quenching qualities but with that comes a lack of body. A little apple and citrus tang, but very little in the way of flavorful malt and hops.



A very lightweight beer but quite nice to drink quickly for a refreshing feel."

Hops are small, and this definitely on the APA side of IPA, with not much bitterness to speak of, but it does provide a decent drinking experience as long as you know what you are getting and, importantly, what you are not getting.



Golden, attractive pour and a nice head and decent lacing. There is a refreshing presence about the beer too.

Very lively carbonation with streams and streams of bubbles rising quickly to give a small but persistent bone-white head. Some watery lacing.
That lovely, clean Pils hop aroma dominates and gets carried over to the taste. Absolutely simple, with the requisite bitter hop twang in the long, dry finish.
Puckeringly dry bitterness gives a metallic mouthfeel that is perfect for the style.
I'm not a huge fan of the style, but there is no doubt that this is a very, very nice example. If your thing is Pilsener's then this would be a very nice staple to have on hand."

750 mL corked & caged.



Pours an American Pale Ale orange color with a massive head and lots of carbonation. Once it all settles down, you see some chill haze and plenty of yeast sediment particles.



Very earthy, grassy, farmhouse aroma which ALWAYS reminds me of cider, and there are some sparkling wine qualities about the beer. Quite gassy to drink too.



Tastes are of a good Saison and has some Champagne characteristics in the nose and mouthfeel and tastes. Some mild hops in there too.



Carbonation is a bit prickly and there is a dry short finish to compliments. 



Very well crafted, a nice summer aperitif."

Appearance. Pretty good, nice clarity & color and good level of carbonation too. Unfortunately we lose the head quickly and little or no lacing develops.



Decent refreshing palate and a passable hop twang in the short finish too. Lack of dryness helps the beer be drinkable.



Aroma is slight skunk, but typical of a macro lager/pilsners.

It has all the appearance, aroma and taste characteristics of a watered down version of the classic English brew. Some creamy head remians after the initial pour, but not much. A little lacing.



A wee bit thin in terms of the body and mouthfeel for a Porter, but some decent smokiness and chocolate malt character in the beer.

Decent color, but a lifeless pour lacking head, lacing or any kind of carbonation or character.



Certainly some sweet malt taste, but it fades quickly to give a bland drink that didn't merit any further investigation. Perhaps nearer the source this would be better, but this did not travel well from Myrtle Beach down the coast to Hilton Head, SC.



Update: Came back to this in the same bar (Hinchey's on Hilton Head Island) six months later to give it another try. This time I got a better impression but it was still served way too cold and it took a good twenty minutes to get any significant aroma and taste out of it. This time I got more nuttiness and a deeper malt character, but this was still a pretty average offering. This is the only bar on HHI that I have seen carrying this.

This gets better everytime I drink it. Even more smoothness than I remember, more rounded, more port like and sherry aftertastes, it gives me a warm glow inside. Delicious. Much darker pour that I remember in years past, and checking the review from a year ago that seems to be the case. Much better in 2006 and I have adjusted the scores accordingly. Really dark mahogony greets me this time. Lovely sweet malts in the nose. Less bitter too. 
I have bumped up one or two of the scores to reflect my new found devotion to this old friend.

Now in brown bottles with an updated shape & label.
Quite a light orange pour with some chill haze, not a great head and not much lacing either. All of these traits improve as the temperature increases. The appearance is somewhat disappointing, but luckily things get better when I drink the beer.
Some toffee malts in the nose. A surprisingly dryish hop taste compliments the malt backbone nicely. I get some bread notes too, like some fruit bread of some description, maybe even some banana.
Good mouthfeel, and a nice IPA type, lingering finish. Some soft brown sugar adds to the ""winter"" feel, but this doesn't have any spice character. Good body and a mild richness about the beer."

Corked and ""Clamped"" rather than Caged, 750 mL bottle.



This is a special beer indeed, that I simply classify as a great, ""Light Belgian Pale Ale"". By that I mean that if such a thing existed as a ""light"" Belgian, I beleive that this would be it.



HUGE, and I mean HUGE, frothy head, with massive retention and beautiful lacing against the backdrop of a orange/golden body.



Nose is honey sweetness that gets more intense as the temperature climbs.



Taste reflects the depth of a fruity Belgian Pale (yes I know this is French but there is a yeast component that seems to make this typically Belgian) against a massive drinkability that seems almost non-alcoholic in its ease of consumption. Don't get me wrong, the alcohol is there at 8.00% ABV, but it is shielded and delevoped by the sweetness and the rustic ambience.



Immensely drinkable, this is truly a delicious offering."
Burton Bridge Brewery,Burton Bridge Empire India Pale Ale,,,English India Pale Ale (IPA),7.50%,bottle,4.83,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,12/29/2005,"This had it all for me.



Tasty, fruity and alcoholic, a hop edge and a malt backbone. One of the most complicated, and complex beers that I have drunk in a long time.



Orange body with a big frothy head with nice retention and some lacing.



It stimulates the taste buds from all angles. There is a very unexpected fruit backbone that compliments the sweet malts and the surprisingly hoppy ending character too. A long, long finish that takes you through the sense spectrum, and a decent alcohol kick that is more based in spirits than in beer. A little rum taste in there too.



Some complex sugars also present in the form of fruit esters, but the marriage is close to perfect. A truly great beer."
Palmetto Brewing Company,Palmetto Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),?,on-tap,1.68,2,1.5,1.5,2,2,12/29/2005,"Extremely basic APA with all the typical characteristics of a low to medium quality, staple beer. Served too cold, generating no head, no lacing and virtually no aroma and no taste. Under different circumstances (i.e. some care and consideration) perhaps this would be a better experience, but nowhere have I enjoyed a pint drawn in a different manner.



Pale orange appearance with some chill haze and no nose to speak of. Dryish mouthfeel that goes through to the finish with an absence of malt or hops, this is below average in the extreme.



By all means try it once, that probably will be your one and only flirtation."
Yuengling Brewery ,Yuengling Black & Tan,,,Black & Tan,4.70%,bottle,2.68,3,3,2.5,3,2.5,12/29/2005,"Slightly confused by the concept of a Black & Tan in a bottle (all my experience is with these ""mixed"" drinks is them being poured at the bar) but thought I should at least try it.



Unsurprisingly, average in the extreme. Some fizzy carbonation out of the bottle, sort of had a caramel appearance, looking a lot like a Michelob Amber Bock pour. Carbonation was way too great, in fact a rather nasty, fizzy experience.



Any aroma was masked by the fact it was poured into a frosted mug, but after about ten minutes it began to release a little nutty character. After that, the tastes were of mild liquorice and some sweet malts. A little bitterness in the finish, but not hops, more of a metallic twang.



First and last bottle of this consumed I expect."

It’s a pale orange pour with a small, white and creamy looking head. Head fades quickly to a spotty film with no lacing or retention to speak of.



Lots of malt up front, even to the point of giving a rum like, sweet taste.

Some light, sweet hops in the nose. Taste continues to reflect that with sweetness alongside the well defined hop profile. Some lingering bitterness in the finish. I get a little yeast taste upfront too, accompanied by some dryish powder feel. Definitely some ""tinny"" metallic aftertaste too.



Mouthfeel has a tiny bit of slick syrup.



Pretty drinkable."

Acidic fruit flavors in the nose, but the specific blackcurrant smell does not come through until the beer warms.
Good, tart acidity in the initial tastes that slowly mellows. There is not much else other than the tart acidity in the taste.
Mouthfeel is pretty thin, but at the same time refreshing.
One of those beers that needs to be drunk in context, perhaps at Christmas, or as an aperitif or on a summer picnic. Not a huge favorite of mine, and somewhat removed from beer, but an interesting novelty."
Big River Grille & Brewing Works,Sweet Magnolia Brown,,,English Brown Ale,?,on-tap,4.05,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,12/24/2005,"Very classical type appearance with a deep chestnut color and decent head that leaves some lacing. The color is excellent and makes the beer appear to have some depth and body.



Malty aroma is backed up by a sweetness in the taste. Very little hop character or bitterness here, this is a simple, malt based brown ale that really hits the spot in terms of the style and drinkability. Very easy, light drinking on this one. A tiny bit of milk chocolate in there too.



Goes down easy, and before you know it you could consume a great deal of this. A very ""moreish"" beer that demands more consumption.



Nice, easy, tasty and light drinking beer."
Brasserie Duyck,Jenlain Ambrée,,,Bière de Garde,7.50%,bottle,4.43,4,5,4.5,3,4.5,12/24/2005,"$2.49 Ziggy's, Chattanooga, TN, USA, single 11.2 fl oz bottle. 



Poured into the Trois Pistoles chalice, we get an amber pour with some soapy like head and very little lacing.



Aroma is excellent with a lot of sherry and rum like aromas. This is both a good and a bad thing. It's good because it smells delicious, but bad since it creates a mental picture of the taste that is richer, thicker and more complex than the mouthfeel, and ultimately the taste, delivers.



Taste is alcoholic liquor, that fades quickly in the rather thin mouthfeel to leave a medicinal or perhaps a vermouth type aftertaste. The finish is quite long, and it definitely levaves that herbal vermouth type taste - for those that remember a Cinzanno Bianco!



Unique taste, refreshing and delicious. If this had a better mouthfeel we would have a stunning beer, as it is it is still a very, very nice beer."
Greene King / Morland Brewery,Hen's Tooth,,,English Pale Ale,6.50%,bottle,4.7,4,4,5,4.5,5,12/23/2005,"This, my BA friends, is one very, very interesting beer. It captures all the characteristics of a really nice English Pale Ale, adds a little cask or ""Real Ale"" character and pumps up the ABV for both of those styles at the same time. All of this in a bottle as well!



Typical pale orange pour, typical lack of sustainable head (cask characteristic) and typical organic grassiness in the nose. All coming together to complement one another, this is reminiscent of a Home Counties pub in more than one way. (Serious hint of nostalgia incorporated into the review).



As expected, there is a soapy, thin hop character that is so typical of these beers, but this is followed quickly by a serious malt assault, and a decent alcoholic twang. The alcohol seems bigger than the 6.50%, but perhaps that is because I wasn't expecting it in this beer. Whatever the reason, the consequence is a delicious combination that makes me want to gulp this down.



A truly interesting combination of style, strength and character, this is simply one HELL of a beer."
Stone Brewing Co.,Stone Smoked Porter,,,American Porter,5.90%,bottle,4.08,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,12/23/2005,"Jet black body but with some ruby red highlights at the bottom of the glass. Only at the bottom though. Definite ""Guinness like"" appearance with some very nice lacing. About one-eigth of an inch of dense, tan colored head persists all the way to the bottom of the drink.



Very smooth mouthfeel.



Liquorice start, with sweetness prevailing upfront. Increasingly sweet as the bottle is consumed. I was suprised at the lack of ""smokiness"" given the name, but I enjoyed more because it was lacking that quality. Nice version of a classic style.



Very drinkable."
Tommyknocker Brewery,Alpine Glacier Lager,,,American Pale Lager,4.50%,bottle,2.68,3,2,2.5,3,3.5,12/23/2005,"Some chill haze against the backdrop of a golden body with some scant head, a little lacing but very poor stickability.



Well, this is a very, very basic macro type lager. Grain tastes and smells dominate but it is still pretty drinkable. Clean taste and some refreshing quality. A tiny, tiny hop bitterness in the short finish, but not much.



Very little to report here, lawnmower qualities and quite drinkable. Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed. A nice addition to the fridge in the summer if you want to offer something that isn't BMC to the BI's that you know. A long way from crossover potential, but still OK."
Max Lager's American Grill & Brewery,Max Abbey,,,Dubbel,?,on-tap,4.13,3.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,12/21/2005,"Extermely nice, surpassed my expectations by some distance.



Nice authentic brown color with some spotty head and a little lacing. This could be improved with a better pour, the presentation let it down a bit.



Very creamy in the mouth, with a solid malt presence but also a distinct Belgian feel. Some mild spice apparent and very sweet. The sweetness did not overpower the beer, and I thought it was a pretty decent example of the style.



Nice malt nose completes this very acceptable package. One of Max Lagers stronger offerings."
Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),Samuel Smith's Organically Produced Ale,,,English Pale Ale,5.00%,bottle,4.35,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,12/19/2005,"550 mL, dark brown, sturdy looking bottle, so not quite a full English pint, but almost there. Pours to give a nice soapy looking thin head, a golden orange body and a hint of chill haze.



The nose is made up mainly of sweet hops.



As expected a mild flavored beer, with a low-profile hop tang, a dryish mouthfeel and some lovely, classic English malt balance. To go with the hops we have a hint of walnuts of all things, and a very refreshing drinkability. Reminiscent of a cask beer in most ways, except the level of carbonation which is of course, much greater here than one would expect in a ""Real Ale"".



This is the kind of beer that is typical in England, but very, very under-represented in the USA. In general, its subtle character remains under appreciated on this side of the Atlantic.



A gem in many respects, savor it if and when you can get it."
Flying Dog Brewery,Wild Dog Weizenbock,,,Weizenbock,8.60%,bottle,4.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,12/18/2005,"750 mL in a corked and caged bottle. In general it's $11.99 in the Atlanta area.



Lovely looking, red bronzed pour in the Tucher Weizen 0.5 L glass with a equally good looking head and some substantial lacing.



Cloves, banana and caramel in the nose.



Mouthfeel is great, with a creaminess and some real sense of a substantial alcoholic body.



In terms of taste there is delicious alcohloic, ripe banana base, all against a massive malt backbone. Super, substantial and satisfying. Drinks much like a quality Doppelbock.



Although very nice, very drinkable and very enjoyable still not great value for money. A bit expensive."
Summit Brewing Company,Summit Winter Ale,,,Winter Warmer,6.10%,bottle,3.28,4,2.5,3.5,3,3.5,12/18/2005,"Dark chestnut hue with some red highlights too. Minimal head but nevertheless some decent lacing.



A little bit of hop aroma but really very little.



Taste is a dry hop with a little spice. For a winter warmer this is very subdued but still very drinkable. Some nice bitterness in the finish.



Mouhtfeel is OK, but a very average performer in most categories. OK, but nothing spectacular to report."
"Bell's Brewery, Inc.",Bell's Batch 7000,,,American Double / Imperial Stout,12.00%,bottle,3.15,4,4,3,3,2.5,12/17/2005,"OK, another American double stout. The pour is exactly as one would expect and looks good. Opaque, jet black body and a small tan and dense head. Some lacing but not extensive.



Aroma is good, with lots of deep alcoholic chocolate. The first few seconds of the taste reflect the deep chocolate sweetness, but then comes the bitterness and it's BIG!



The bitter finish overwhelms things a little bit for me, and as a result I cannot imagine ever drinking much more than 12 oz of this in any one sitting. Couple the ABV and you've got a beer which needs to be enjoyed in very limited quantities.



Mouthfeel is coating, like a much drier stout, so I take a little bit away from the score for that.



This is just a little bit too much for me. It crosses the line in one or two areas to make it difficult to really savor."
George Gale & Company Ltd,Gale's Prize Old Ale,,,Old Ale,9.00%,bottle,4.15,4,5,4,3.5,4,12/16/2005,"2002 Vintage.



Beautiful, deep, alcoholic, fruity Port based aroma that promises a great deal.



The appearance and the taste slightly fail to reach those expectations, but because the smell is so spectacular that wasn't really that suprising or that disappointing.



The color is that of a classic English bitter - a cloudy, orange brown body with a nice, tight head but very little lacing. The aroma suggests a darker body, but this still looks pretty good.



The taste initially does reflect the Port notes of the nose, but this fades very quickly to give an acidic, slightly sour finish. Quite light in the mouthfeel.



Very, very nice example of the style, with an alcoholic, raisin and plum based fruit body."
Gasthaus & Gosebrauerei Bayerischer Bahnhof,Leipziger Gose,,,Gose,4.60%,bottle,2,2,2,2,2,2,12/15/2005,"Poured into the Tucher Weizen glass I get a toffee colored body, lots of cloudy sediment as expected, and a tall, light and frothy head. The body is not particularly attractive since the sediment is somewhat unusual, it looks like small flecks of black soot floating in the beer.



Very, very little to report in the aroma department, perhaps a little citrus.



Taste is very disappointing to me. A thin body and a distinct lack of character. Watery and very non-descript. A little bit of citrus lemon, but outside of that there is some carbonation and nothing else. Thin, bland and lack of body.



Blah..."
Harviestoun Brewery Ltd.,Old Engine Oil,,,English Porter,6.00%,bottle,3.88,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,12/15/2005,"Really good jet black color with some attractive ruby red highlights. Nice creamy, thin, spotty head with a little lacing.



Lovely light alcohol and malt aroma. Mouthfeel is also surprisingly light for the style and the althoguh I would prefer some more body, the lightness adds to the drinkability of the beer.



Taste is also light, but not so much that it detracts from the beer. Some smooth, sweet caramel in the malts and a little drying character in the finish.



This is a bit like a ""light"" old ale! I enjoyed it."
Avery Brewing Company,Ellie's Brown Ale,,,American Brown Ale,5.50%,bottle,4.35,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,12/13/2005,"Nice deep red/brown body, a fluffy rather than a dense head, and some non-sticky lacing.
Malty nuttiness in the aroma.
The taste is *absolutely* dependent on the temperature of this beer. When it is cold everything is very, very muted, but when the temperature rises after about thirty minutes of room temperature standing, this beer blossoms into its full glory! Full sweet, nut flavors bathe the tongue, and there is a real sense of fulfillment from the drink. Delicious bitter finish on top of the sweet malt body, this beer screams balance and satisfaction.
Mouthfeel is excellent, smooth and delicious.
Really nice - as long it's not served cold!"
Brouwerij Het Anker,Gouden Carolus Tripel,,,Tripel,9.00%,bottle,3.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,12/13/2005,"750 mL corked & caged bottle. 



Rather disappointing appearance, a bit flat and a very murky orange colored mess make up the body. I was hoping for a rather more yellow, clearer body. Some nice head, but it's gone all too quickly. Appearance is this beers weakest link. (I am beginning to wonder how old this bottle really is).



Aroma and taste are typical for the style, with strong Belgian yeasts and fruits dominating the overall experience. Obviously there is the alcohol and the sugar, but these are lower-key than many others of the same style.



Nice mouthfeel with a tiny bitterness in the shortish finish.



Pretty ordinary example of the style, I enjoyed it but I expect more from an authentic belgian Tripel."
Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,Raison D'extra,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,18.00%,bottle,4.2,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,12/13/2005,"Poured into the St. Bernardus chalice, I wanted to give this a full chance to breathe and release those deep aromas. Burned orange color, obviously zero head and zero lacing. Slightly viscous, liquor like appearance, again as expected.



Aroma is all fruity alcohol. The alcohol is the main component (not exactly a surprise), but this is coupled with some deep, soft fruits like plums and prunes.



The taste is basically sherry like. The alcohol is surprisingly muted compared to the aroma. Obviously a massive heavyweight, this demands simple, low volume sipping at the very end of an evening. You could easily share a 12 oz bottle between two or even three friends and still appreciate this beer.



Mouthfeel is slick, but oddly seems to have a little carbonation.



The drinkability is difficult to pin down since I can't imagine anyone drinking more than one of these in any one sitting, and indeed this is probably a very, very ocassional drink under any circumstances. Having said that I liked it, and it went down easy so I categorize it as being drinkable.



Another DFH ground-beaker."
Tommyknocker Brewery,Butthead Doppelbock,,,Doppelbock,8.20%,bottle,3.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,12/12/2005,"Nice dark mahogany pour, with a small head due to the higher ABV. Some bubbles in the head and a little bit of lacing.



Quite a bit of alcohol in the nose along with the obvious and strong malts.



Taste is very malty, but the alcohol is pretty large too. If anything, it drinks much, much bigger than the ABV would initially suggest. Nice sweet malt upfront, but balanced by the alcohol and the hops in the finish. Warming on the way down. Some bitterness at the end as well.



Mouthfeel is good and full.



A surprisingly big beer, with some potency. With the bite comes a rough edge and this is where the beer falls down a little bit. It's an unrefined Doppelbock."
Brouwerij Van Steenberge N.V.,Bornem Dubbel,,,Dubbel,7.00%,bottle,3,3,3,3,3,3,12/11/2005,"330 mL Stubbie. Nice presentation.



Typical dirty brown pour, with that distinctive light, frothy head and fairly severe carbonation that can both come with the style quite often. The lacing is fairly reserved, and does not stick. Kind of watery (lack of bady) body.



Yeasty and acidic taste. Not very smooth. Some apple character and some citrus notes.



Mouthfeel is light and feels a little fizzy from the cabonation.



I don't know about the Dubbel style, it's just seems to continue to be a bit hit and miss with me."
Butte Creek Brewing Company,Butte Creek Christmas Cranberry Ale,,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,?,bottle,2.3,4,2.5,2,3,2,12/11/2005,"650 mL (22 oz) bomber.



Decent looking light amber/orange pour with some chill haze, good head and some very, very nice sticky lacing. Unfortunately the lacing was the best part of this beer.



There is *something* in the nose other than 'beer"", but I certainly cannot distinguish it as being cranberry or even fruit.



Some dry bitterness is upfront in the beer, which would be a characteristic of the cranberries, but again, it isn't really distinguishable *as* cranberry. Tastes like a dry pale ale.



Lots of dry character in the aftertaste and the finish, but simply ordinary in the extreme. Virtually devoid of any hop taste, but there is some drying hop ""feel"".



Bit of a disappointment. If you are going to make a fruit beer, I'd like some kind of fruit taste. It's not really here."
"Anheuser-Busch, Inc.",Bud Extra,,,Herbed / Spiced Beer,6.60%,bottle,1.08,2.5,1,1,1,1,12/10/2005,"Oh my gosh, what is this? Beer?
Having resisted since its ""birth"" I finally tried this concoction. Wished I had continued to resist, you'd think I would know better by now, but ho-hum. US$ 3.00 in a seedy sports bar in West Georgia, USA.
Pour is standard nasty macro, but not too offensive. Then comes the aroma and taste offensive - and I mean ""offensive"" in all senses of the word. If you like carbonated cough medicine then this is the ""beer"" for you. Amazing sweetness, medicinal and syrupy feel and taste. This is truly obnoxious. Foul.
I fully understand the marketing of this stuff, but beer it ain't."
Great Divide Brewing Company,Hibernation Ale,,,Old Ale,8.70%,bottle,4.75,4,4,5,5,5,12/10/2005,"Wow!



Pour is a slightly lighter brown body than I was expecting with a nice head and some lacing. The lack of lacing may have been due to the temperature that this was presented (too cold), so I am happy to give it the benefit of the doubt.



As it warms the aroma is all malty, nuttiness - very nice. The aroma is followed quickly by a complimentary sweetness in the taste. A really spectacular nut/malt brown ale feel. In fact, to get a real feel for what this beer does best, it would need to be re-categorized into the brown ale group. A little hop bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is beautiful with a rounded sweetness doing a stunning number on the tongue and cheeks.



Very, very satisfying in the ABV department, and with it an amazingly drinkability to go along with that. This is a great beer!"
Rogue Brewery (Brewer's on the Bay),FestiveAle,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,6.20%,bottle,2.1,2.5,3.5,1.5,3,1.5,12/10/2005,"A really simple beer to review and talk about in my opinion.
This has the aroma of a classic Saison, perhaps is a little too dark but I can live with that, and gives a Saison taste for a few seconds and then guess what? Well, as is SO often the case, the over-hopping bitterness of Rogue cuts across and through absolutely every redeeming quality.
It simply does not work. A Saison is unlikely to be a brew that Rogue can pull off, and this confirms it. They appear to have attempted to combine a Saison with a winter, hopped beer and of course, the result is a mess.
Why the West Coast Hop kings would attempt this subtle style is beyond me. I suppose you could argue that they wanted to put their own stamp upon the stlye - and that's fair enough - but this just makes a mess of the style and fails to do it any justice. Nowhere near representative. Leave well alone."
Tommyknocker Brewery,Maple Nut Brown Ale,,,American Brown Ale,4.50%,bottle,4.03,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,12/9/2005,"Very, very attractive pour with a really deep mahogany color, nice substantial head and significant lacing.



Aroma is a nutty sweetness as expected.



Balanced brew with a nice sweetness that does not overpower the brew. Still finishes with a little smokiness and a tiny bitterness. Malt lovers will be delighted with this.



Very drinkable and a nice everyday drinker. I'd certainly go for this again, and the Tommyknocker Imperial Brown Ale ""older bother"" is also a very nice beer. Nice, sweet example of the style."
Brasserie de l'Abbaye du Val-Dieu,Val-Dieu Brune,,,Dubbel,8.00%,bottle,3.83,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,12/8/2005,"Quite a dark pour, much more so than I expected. Lots of floaties that took some time to settle down. Some head, but it is airy and then disappears quickly to leave some lacing and a spotty, creamy thin head.



Aroma is pretty non-descript, some alcohol and a little dark fruit.



Obviously Belgian yeast presence in the taste and increasingly bitter as I drink it. Decent alcohol in the finish, and a little dry as the drink ends.



A little prickly carbonation takes something away from the mouthfeel, but it's not very significant.



Nice rounded Dubbel, not my favorite style but enjoyable."
Avery Brewing Company,The Czar,,,Russian Imperial Stout,11.00%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,12/6/2005,"The pour is certainly very, very dark brown if not quite black in hue. Quite a few ruby red highlights, but not quite a jet-black as I was anticipating.
Aroma is really quite sweet with a little roastiness.
Taste is very smooth and sweet, with the bitterness reserved for the very end of the short finish. Some carbonation in the mouthfeel and the head is a little more ""airy"" than the style would suggest.
Very drinkable RIS considering the strength."
Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),Samuel Adams Imperial Pilsner 2005 Harvest,,,American Double / Imperial Pilsner,8.80%,bottle,4.38,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,12/4/2005,"Review: 09/06 - thanks to SilentSabre for a chance to re-visit.



Well past what Jim Koch recommends, but I wanted to experiment wih some age on this. Looks identical to ten months ago with great sticky lacing, and orange clouded body. From memory it appears that the hop profile has receeded alot (expected) but at the same time a strong grapefruit bitterness has replaced it. Almost as if a hop bitterness has been replaced by an acidic bitterness. Having said that, there is still a sweet alcohol presence and I still think this is very drinkable - not what it once was, but still drinkable.



Often I am sceptical of best before dates, and although that this beer certainly didn't go nasty at midnight on 01/31/06 it clearly hasn't benefitted much from time. Sometimes I like the way that intentionally hoppy beers fade over time to accentuate the malts but this is one seemed to lose a little - not much, just a little.



Original Review: 12/05



Nice. Double Pilsner? Well, I don't know about that, but it seems more like a Double IPA to me.



Huge hops all over the place, but tempered by some malt sweetness - very reminiscent of Stoudts Double IPA.



Thick, looking orange pour, with a large amount of cloudiness, a nice head and some excellent, viscous, sticky lacing. 



Hops and sweet malts are upfront and large, and essentially remove any characteristics that might put it into a classic Pilsner category. This has DIPA written all over it.



Drinks beautifully with the rare combo of masssive hops initially balanced by large malt sweetness in the finish. Some sticky sweetness finishes it off too.



A pretty big beer all around, with a very nice quality feel to it. This might be interesting to age a little."
Brasserie de l'Abbaye du Val-Dieu,Val-Dieu Blond,,,Belgian Pale Ale,6.00%,bottle,3.55,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,12/4/2005,"Part of a 3-bottle gift pack that included 11.2 oz bottles of this, the Brown and the Tripel and a Val-Dieu goblet for $11.99. Good value I thought.



Very light, almost dare I say it, macro lager like appearance, with some fairly aggressive carbonation. The carbonation is a little too much for me, and it leads to a rather thin body, mouthfeel and light, non-persistent head.



Definite Belgian yeast taste, but the ""Pale"" in Belgian Pale is really the dominant feature of this brew and it is surprisingly light and almost weak in taste and body. Nice finish that gives a fruity, dry taste, but by then the disappointment has already set in.



In a word, ""Light""."
Russian River Brewing Company,Supplication,,,American Wild Ale,7.00%,bottle,4,4,4,4,4,4,12/4/2005,"Unusual bottle in shape (long-neck wine type), color (dark olive green) and volume (375 mL).



My first venture into the American Wild style and I got pretty much exactly what I expected. A sort of cross between a Flanders/Flemish Red, a Lambic and a traditional Somerset or Devonshire scrumpy (cider to all of you in the USA).



Attractive dark orange pour with a decent head but very little lacing. Slightly cloudy, that looks a lot like chill haze but isn't really.



Apple sourness in the nose and in the taste. The more I drink the more this reminds me of a classic framhouse scrumpy, but this is definitely more refined, more drinkable and smoother than the classic English country drink.



Thanks to BeerBeing for the trade."

Medium body that lacks the richness of many O'fests. Lack of punch in the mouthfeel and taste departments. Goes down well, has session potential. Aroma muted too. For fuller notes see;

Cloudy, orange body with what looks like some chill haze, almost no head except for a little attractive, spottiness on the surface, and next to no lacing.



Aroma is a hop bomb, double IPA type with no hint of the malt sweetness that follows.



Super-sweet malts start this off, only to be balanced by an equally large burst of hops that come in the middle and the finish of this big BW. Sort of excess, followed by excess. A little peppery hoppiness in the finish. Quite a significant grapefruit bitterness too.



Mouthfeel is slick, but not oppressively so. 



Drinkability about in line with the style, i.e. not great becasue of the massive nature of the beer, but not bad."
Rogue Brewery (Brewer's on the Bay),Brutal Bitter Ale,,,American IPA,5.80%,bottle,3.68,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,12/2/2005,"Pretty much as I expected. A decent beer but hopped a little out of the style. To be fair I did not think this was as over-hopped as many other Rogue offerings, indeed it was more balanced than many of their products, but this is NOT an ESB.
Attractive pour with a light copper color and a nice head with some lacing.
Taste is typically Rogue. Lots of hops upfront and all the way through to the finish. Grapefruit is dominant with metallic twang in the finish. Obviously this lacks the subtle notes that, say, an English ESB would impart, but then again it's not an English ESB so it's difficult to be too harsh.
Decent mouthfeel and fairly easy drinking. If you are familiar with Rogue this will hold absolutely NO surprises, in fact this is kind of an archetypal Rogue brew."

Nice red/brown body with a decent head but not much lacing.



Aroma begins to tempt the acidic sourness straight out of the box, and this is reflected immediately in the taste. Taste is all dry, acidic tartness with a little bit of fruity cherry character. Slight medicinal feel.



Just not really my cup of tea. I found it to be not especially drinkable because despite knowing that the style and what to expect, it still is not easy to enjoy and get down."
Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),Samuel Adams Holiday Porter,,,American Porter,5.80%,bottle,3.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,11/29/2005,"Good black color, nice creamy head and some surprisingly good lacing. A little red highlight at the bottom of the glass too.
Smell is sweeter and less bitter than many American Porters and emphasizes the smooth aspects of the style. All good I feel.
Taste is rounded and subtle with a distinct lack of bitterness and a very nice smooth feel. Too often I find American Porters to concentrate on the bitter, hoppy, dark coffee flavors rather than the smooth silky nature of the style. This is a nice exception. Tasty hops present.
Mouthfeel is good, with a slightly above average body and more than average smoothness for the American version of the Porter.
The combination of this, the Fezziwig and the very solid Winter and Black Lagers, make the Sam Adams Holiday mixed 12 pack a really excellent value purchase for mid-week, everyday drinking around the Christmas Season."
Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,Raison D'etre,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,8.00%,bottle,3.68,2.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,11/28/2005,"Poured into the Chimay goblet, there was a distinct lack of life to the beer with little or no carbonation, and as a result vitually no head or lacing. 



Murky orange/brown hue reminiscent of cold tea, I'm afraid this did not score high on the appearance scale at all.



Aroma is of sweet fruits and deep seated sugar, but the fruits are not really very distinguishable - some candied pineapple perhaps, maybe some orange?



Mixed fruits are upfront in the taste too, then there is an alcoholic and (briefly) hoppy finish that is really very short. Finally some tart fruit cuts in at the very end.



Slick mouthfeel because of the alcohol and the sweetness, but the cloying sweetness seems to boast an ABV even higher than the advertised 8%.



Not bad, but not DFH's best brew by a long chalk, but they have set the bar pretty high so I am happy not to be too critical."
Avery Brewing Company,The Kaiser,,,Märzen / Oktoberfest,10.00%,bottle,2.75,3,3,3,2.5,2,11/26/2005,"Imperial Oktoberfest? Well, for all intents and purposes I think we have a beer that is basically a Barleywine.



Massive sugar, with the associated cloying sweetness, large alcohol up front and all the way through and very little subtle respite from the sugar and the alcohol.



Some decent head early, but this fades quickly on warming to give a typical high alcohol ""dead head"" and sweet, thick body. Some residual lacing, but this is as a result of the sticky sweetness rather than any decent, staying head. Good orange color.



Smell is, unsurprisingly, sweet alcohol.



Drinkability is low, since the alcohol and sweet combo are just too great for much enjoyment. this does NOT drink like an Oktoberfest, in all respects this reminds me of a BW."
Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams),Samuel Adams Cranberry Lambic,,,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,5.90%,bottle,3.55,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,11/26/2005,"Pale yellow, macro lager like body with a slight pink tinge. Some nice carbonation and as a result a pretty decent head and some surprisingly good lacing.



Taste has a refreshing fruit tartness with a little tiny hop bite in the short finish. The fruit is evident both in the taste and the nose, but I can't say that I can place either as being cranberry based. It's certainly a tart, acidic character but beyond that a bit non-descript.



Refreshing and drinkable.



This gets a very poor press here because, I suspect, that reviewers take exception to the fact that it has the Lambic label, which it clearly is not. Why BBC use the Lambic moniker is not clear to me since at best it is misleading, and at worst dishonest. This beer is a decent fruit beer, but it is certainly not a traditional fruit Lambic by any stretch of the imagination."

Got really lucky and managed to pick up four, single bottles at Macs in Atlanta. They had obviously split a few of the Winter packs and I am the lucky beneficiary! Hooray for me.
This year I get identical notes to that in 2007"

2007 Vintage. Bought this at GSO Wine Warehouse on a recent trip to Greensboro, NC, USA. $4.49 for the 22 oz bottle, purchased on the day of release. I resisted the temptation to buy the larger, flip top growler type bottle si"
Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale,,,English Brown Ale,5.00%,bottle,3.1,3,3.5,3,3,3,11/19/2005,"My interest in Brown Ales was recently revived by Tommyknocker and Rogue Hazelnut, which both proved to be really interesting and tasty to me. I wasn't expecting either to really be great, but they were both really delicious, so I came to Sam Smith's with a higher expectation than normal, especially since I though the English version would add something too. I was disappointed, this wasn't as good as either.



Light brown appearance with good lacing, but the color is a little thin. The thin nature is repeated in the mouthfeel.



Tastes are slightly acidic and has a large amount of metallic character, not very nice. More bitterness in the finish than I would like for the style and a lack of the nutty sweetness that I was hoping for."
Wells & Young's Ltd,Young's Ram Rod,,,Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB),5.00%,bottle,4.48,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,11/19/2005,"Rather light, golden appearance with some cloudiness. Nice fluffy head, if somewhat small, with a little lacing and mild carbonation.



Malty sweetnes in the aroma.



A little dry in the finish, but this reflects the English ESB style nicely. Typical mild flavor which makes this infinitely drinkable.



Smooth, sweet, malt and hops in perfect combination that give a lovely aftertaste that makes the bitterness seem really creamy and balanced."
Molson Breweries Of Canada. Ltd.,Molson XXX,,,American Malt Liquor,7.30%,can,1.95,3,1.5,2,2,2,11/18/2005,"25.4 fl oz Black ""Oil Can"".



Well, for what it is it's not bad. Of course, what it is is not good, but I think you may know what I mean.



Appearance is not horrible, and is its best feature. A little too yellow, but apart from that, a decent head and some lacing.



Aroma is predictable, being alcoholic sweet vegetable matter.



Taste is all alcohol and sweet corn, but it lacks the unpleasant syrupy nastiness that I was expecting.



I'd imagine this is a drinkable method of getting slaughtered for the Canadian and the northern college masses, but that's where the charm begins and ends!"
Deschutes Brewery,Obsidian Stout,,,American Stout,6.40%,bottle,3.93,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,11/17/2005,"Best Before 4/21/05, drunk in November of '05, so six months or so late, but I doubt that it matters a great deal.



Jet black body, some nice spotty lacing and a tiny bit a lacing. The body is very attractive, super-inky!



Mild, burned smokiness in the aroma, not strong but still observeable.



Drinks much like a Porter, with a little bit of the typical stout bitterness in the short finish. Some dry cocoa in the taste."
Boulevard Brewing Co.,Bully! Porter,,,American Porter,5.20%,bottle,3.28,3.5,4,3,3.5,3,11/16/2005,"Best before 01/16/06.



Highly carbonated pour leads to a dark brown body and a airy and bubbly head that leaves some lacing.



Sweet and malty aroma that promises much. Surprisingly the taste does not really reflect the aroma. The initial tastes are much, much more bitter than the smell suggests, or that the style would normally allow. I like my Porters more creamy and mild in thier nature and this drinks a little more like a stout.



Mouthfeel is that of a thin Porter.



Drinkability OK, but not high because of the rather out of context bitterness."
Odell Brewing Company,Odell Cutthroat Porter,,,American Porter,5.10%,bottle,3.63,3,4,3.5,4,3.5,11/15/2005,"A red-brown color than the more typical black color of a Porter. Nice looking, tall and frothy head with good retention and some attractive lacing.



Some chocolate and coffee notes, with an above average nose. Some pleasing smokiness & bitterness in the finish complements the fullish mouthfeel.



Pretty drinkable but lack of creaminess and nutty tastes take this a little more into Brown Ale territory than I was expecting. Not a classic within the style, but a pretty nice dark ale."
Pivovar Herold B&#345;eznice A.s.,Herold Bohemian Wheat Lager,,,Euro Pale Lager,5.10%,bottle,3.93,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,11/15/2005,"Golden butterscotch cloudy pour, with a nice head and a small amount of lacing.



Rather unusual in the smell and the taste. There is an amazingly strong fruit taste that has a typical over-ripe banana taste as the underlying feature, but then comes through in a really unusual way. There is a very strong taste of strawberries and blackcurrants - really strong.



Definite lack of spice and cloves but still very drinkable in a fruity sense. Nice full mouthfeel, with some citric tartness and a little carbonation.



Interesting rather than a classic Hefe."
Brasserie Caracole,Caracole Ambrée,,,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,8.00%,bottle,3.95,4,4,4,3.5,4,11/13/2005,"330 mL bottle poured into the Duvel tulip. Good white head, with nice lacing and retention. Pale amber color.



Typically Belgian, yeasty nose and some sweetness and pepper spice in the initial taste.



Some sharp bitterness in the finish, quite surprising.



To be honest, a little watery in the mouthfeel - not its best feature.



Alcohol is there, but relatively well hidden.



Solid example, but not a stunning brew. Definitely worth investigating but not a great beer."
Pivovar Herold B&#345;eznice A.s.,Herold Bohemian Black Lager,,,Schwarzbier,5.20%,bottle,4.23,4,4,4.5,4,4,11/13/2005,"Very nice, and very surprised at how much I enjoyed this.



To all intents and purposes this acts, looks and drinks like a Porter. Cartainly a thin one, but nevertheless still has some smokiness, some chocolate, some creamy smoothness and a nice bitter/sweet finish.



Definitely some Port like alcohol in the taste, it's a real nice beer. Drinkability is high."
Pivzavod Baltika / Baltic Beverages Holding,Baltika #8 Wheat,,,Hefeweizen,5.00%,bottle,3.85,3,3.5,4,3,4.5,11/13/2005,"Good color and cloudiness in the pour, but way too much coagulation and large protein/yeasty floaties for my liking. I like my Hefe's without MASSIVE clumps!
Decent head with some retention, not much lacing.
Lack of cloves in the nose and taste, but lots and lots of bananas. Bananas and alcohol in the nose, slightly watery mouthfeel. Bananas continue to dominate.
Aftertaste is slightly acidic, a little tartness in the beer all the way through, but it carries it well.
Not bad at all."
Great Divide Brewing Company,Fresh Hop Pale Ale,,,American Pale Ale (APA),6.10%,bottle,4.23,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,11/12/2005,"Very light orange color with a nice bubbly (soapy like) head with some lacing. Clarity is big and its definitely a good looker. The light and clear appearance certainly adds to the feel of ""freshness"".



Lovely grass-like, hay hop profile runs through the smell and the taste. Light citrus with bitterness along the backside and malt backbone holds the whole package together. Amazingly light and refreshing drink. To be honest this is probably as far as a Pale Ale can go before becoming an IPA.



Love the shade of green used on the label too!!"

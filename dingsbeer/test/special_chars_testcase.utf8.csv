De Leyerth Brouwerijen (Urthel),Urthel Saisonnière,,,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,6.00%,bottle,4.23,4,4,4.5,4,4,3/10/2011,"11.2 oz bottle.
Surprised to see this at The Beer Dispensary in Apex, NC, USA. Not an Urthel beer that I have ever seen in the US before.
Pour gives a pretty standard, honeyed, hazed, lemon color with a nice creamy white foam on top. Some nice lace as the beer sits in the Brasserie de l'Abbaye des Rocs goblet.
A significant, sweet earthiness permeates the nose of this beer right from the get go. Organic feel about the beer.
In typical Urthel fashion the tastes are a little reminiscent of a Belgian IPA with some significant bitterness and a little hoppy note in the finish. The hoppy bitterness breaks the white pepper bitterness open a touch, and *slightly* moves the beer to a different level from your typical Saison.
The aftertastes accentuates the soapy, hoppy bitter section but it never gets aggressive and always feels within, if somewhat prodding at the edges, of the style.
Tasty, and a touch off-beat for the style but for me it works well. Nice"
Cigar City Brewing,Improvisación Oatmeal Rye India-style Brown Ale,,,American Brown Ale,9.00%,bottle,1.88,3,2,1.5,3.5,1.5,2/6/2011,"Given to me as a gift from a well-known bar owner. Many thanks.
750 mL capped bottle. Not really sure what a Oatmeal, Rye, India Brown Ale is, but...
Opening produces a HUGE gusher - not a trivial amount of beer lost, in fact around one third of the total contents are lost on the kitchen counter. Makes me think 'infection' or a best 'over-carbonated', we'll see.
The pour gives a frankly UGLY, chocolate brown color to the body that looks like viscous med - totally opaque. The head is obviously very good, well retained, a coffee-color and gives some nice lace. In that respect the beer looks good, but the color is just pain UGLY. An immediate paradox in the appearance.
The nose gives an acidic twang and some blue cheese. This makes me think Brett or infection.
The tastes reflect the nose and offer an acidic, light, blue cheese note and not much else. Funk is all over the place and the sour note persists through the beer, or at least the amount I can get down before drain pouring the rest of the bottle.
Disappointing."
Les Trois Mousquetaires,Série Signature Kellerbier,,,Keller Bier / Zwickel Bier,5.50%,bottle,3.58,5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,2/12/2011,"750 mL corked & caged bottle. Opens with a decent pop. Arbor Place Beverage, Douglasville, GA, USA.
Hazy, butterscotch orange pour with a splendid head. The head is very ice-cream like, and threatens to be almost solid. Thick white density with retention to match. Great looking beer.
Nose gives a characteristic musty, rye note which is carried into the taste. The tastes give quite a bitter, peppery note that lacks the charm or fruitiness of a beer like a Saison, or the sweetness of a Tripel, two styles that also offer some pepper. This seems more black pepper than white pepper.
Not a style I care for a lot, but this did look fantastic and offered a pretty nice drink, but the musty character lingers a little and it's what turns me away from these beers a bit."
König-Brauerei GmbH,König Pilsener,,,German Pilsener,4.90%,can,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,10/15/2010,"500 mL can thanks to Kevin. Cheers mate.
A crazy colored pour which is pale, but distinctly yellow. Not golden like some macros, but really noticeably yellow. A very sticky but quite a light and fluffy head.
Very clean malts in the nose and tastes but it comes without much Saaz like bite in the finish. The lack of distinct bitterness means it's a little off base for me. 
Extremely clean and crisp and this is really n extension of those pale, pilsner malt bills. Again the finish lacks any intensity in the hop bitterness but the whole package sits well with me, and the beer is more drinkable than I was expecting.
Ultimately I really quite enjoyed this - tasty sand very drinkable."
Unibroue,Édition 2005,,,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,10.00%,bottle,3.95,4,4,4,3.5,4,10/15/2005,"===
Cellared Review 09/09

Well, 4+ years on this beer, time to crack one open. 
Firstly the pop on opening gave an indication of things to come. It was small, and although not completely dead it was disappointingly slight. I was anticipating some drop"
Žatecký Pivovar,Žatec,,,Czech Pilsener,4.60%,bottle,2.58,3,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,8/10/2008,"500 mL bottle, $2.99 from Arbor Place Beverage, Douglasville, GA, USA.
Standard golden clarity on the pour into the Sweetwater Pils glass, with a steady but not large carbonation. In fact carbonation falls away rapidly to leave the beer feels very flat at the end of the brew.
Strange nose that sweet and veggie/grainy. Not especially attractive.
This is disappointing. It is not very clean at all (one of the chief attributes that I am looking for in a Pils), and it has a weird sweet/cardboard taste. Not clean in the finish either.
As I say, not at all exciting and in the final analysis even quite poor."
